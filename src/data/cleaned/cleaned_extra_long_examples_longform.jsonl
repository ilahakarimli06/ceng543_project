{"id": "dev_longform_46", "text": "it may be worth beginning this introduction with a brief overview of the considerable literature devoted to laplace asymptotic expansions and large deviation principles for the canonical random paths : the brownian motion in @xmath7 . to make things simple\n, the aim of these studies is to investigate the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath8 of @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a brownian motion and @xmath11 are general functionals .\nschilder s pioneering work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) treated the full asymptotic expansion in the case of wiener integrals .\nsimilar results were obtained for conditioned brownian paths ( such as the brownian bridge ) by davies and truman @xcite .\nellis and rosen @xcite also developed further laplace asymptotic expansions for gaussian functional integrals .\nthen azencott and doss @xcite used asymptotic expansions to study the semiclassical limit of the schrdinger equation ( see also azencott @xcite ) .\nthese works initiated a long series ( see for instance @xcite ) and it is beyond the scope of this paper to review the whole literature until nowadays .\none of the aims of this paper is to initiate the study of laplace asymptotics and large deviation principles in the realm of continuous random surfaces .\nthere is an important conceptual difference between canonical random paths and canonical random surfaces .\nwhereas brownian motion and its variants are rather nicely behaved , the canonical two dimensional random surface , i.e. the gaussian free field ( gff ) , is much wilder : it can not be defined pointwise for instance and must be understood as a random distribution . as a consequence , many nonlinear functionals defined solely on the space of continuous functions must be defined via renormalization techniques when applied to the gff : see the book of simon @xcite for instance . in this paper , we consider probably the most natural framework of weighted random surfaces : the @xmath0-liouville field theory ( lft ) .\nlft is ruled by the ( non critical , i.e. @xmath12 ) liouville action @xmath13\\,\\lambda_{\\hat{g}}({\\mathrm{d}}x)\\ ] ] in the background metric @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the gradient , curvature and volume form of the metric @xmath14 ) with @xmath18 and @xmath190,2]$ ] .\nthis is a model describing random surfaces or metrics .\ninformally , the probability to observe a surface in @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 where @xmath20 stands for the `` uniform measure '' on surfaces . to give a rigorous meaning to this definition we have to interpret the term @xmath22 as the law of the centered free field ( see @xcite )\ntherefore , you replace the brownian motion in by a shifted free field @xmath23 and the nonlinear functional @xmath24 in is the integrated exponential of this free field @xmath25.\\ ] ] such an exponential , also called liouville measure , is nothing but a gaussian multiplicative chaos in @xmath0 .\nrecall that the theory of gaussian multiplicative chaos , founded in 1985 by kahane @xcite , enables to make sense of the exponential of the gff though the exponential is not defined on the abstract functional space the gff lives on .\nour main motivation for considering this framework is to compute the semiclassical limit of @xmath0-liouville quantum field theory and establish a large deviation principle .    before going into further details\n, we must mention that there is a sizeable literature on mathematical studies of discrete random surfaces in all dimensions : see for instance the recent review of funaki @xcite .\nin particular , within the ( discrete ) framework of gradient perturbations of the gff , there has been an impressive series of results : large deviation principles ( see @xcite ) or central limit theorems ( see @xcite for a convergence to the massless gff in the whole space ) for instance .\nnonetheless , the results of this paper bear major differences with the discrete case and , in particular , can not be derived from the discrete frameworks previously considered .\nindeed , in the discrete case , one can work in nice functional spaces whereas , in the continuum setting of this paper , the gff lives in the space of distributions and not in a functional space .\nbesides , an important aspect of our work is the derivation of an exact equivalent for the partition function ( see below ) and more generally the laplace transform of the field @xmath23 : this is a specifc feature of the continuum setting which is essential in the problem of establishing exact relations for the three point correlation function , the celebrated dozz formula @xcite derived on the sphere ( see @xcite for a recent article on this problem )\n.    now recall that , in the physics literature , the liouville action enables to describe random metrics in liouville quantum gravity in the conformal gauge as introduced by polyakov @xcite ( studied by david @xcite and distler - kawai @xcite , see also the seminal work of knizhnik - polyakov - zamolodchikov @xcite in the light cone gauge ) or in @xmath0 string theory ( see klebanov s review @xcite for instance ) .\nthere are many excellent reviews on this topic @xcite .\nthe rough idea is to couple the action of a conformal matter field ( say a planar model of statistical physics at its critical point so as to become conformally invariant ) to the action of gravity .\nthis gives a couple of random variables @xmath26 , where the random metric @xmath27 encodes the structure of the space and @xmath28 stands for the matter field .\nliouville quantum gravity in @xmath0 can thus be seen as a toy model to understand in quantum gravity how the interaction with matter influences the geometry of space - time . in the conformal gauge and up to omitting some details , the law of this couple of random variables tensorizes @xcite and the marginal law of the metric @xmath27 is given by the liouville action .\nthe only way the metric keeps track of its interaction with the matter field @xmath28 is through the parameter @xmath2 , called liouville conformal factor , which can be explicitly expressed in terms of the central charge @xmath29 of the matter field using the celebrated kpz result @xcite @xmath30 therefore , the influence of the matter is parameterized by @xmath2 . in a way\n, we will see that the geometry of space is encoded in the quantity @xmath31 .\nmore precisely , we study the so - called semiclassical limit , meaning the convergence of the field @xmath32 when the parameter @xmath8 while keeping fixed the quantity @xmath33 ( thus @xmath34 ) . in the case where @xmath14 is flat or hyperbolic , we prove that the field @xmath35 ( resp . the measure @xmath36 )\nconverges in law towards the solution @xmath37 ( resp .\n@xmath38 ) to the so - called classical liouville equation @xmath39 recall that equation appears when looking for metrics in the conformal equivalence class of @xmath40 with prescribed ricci scalar curvature @xmath41 and has for instance the following explicit form on the unit disk @xmath42 ( equipped with the flat metric , i.e. take @xmath14 equal to the euclidean metric ) @xmath43 with @xmath440,1[$ ] when imposing dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath45 . the quantity @xmath41 describes the expected curvature of the random metric @xmath46 ( see figure [ bob ] ) for small @xmath2 .\nthe fact that this quantity is negative reflects the hyperbolic nature of the geometry of space .\nwe also characterize the leading order fluctuations around this hyperbolic geometry .\nthey are gaussian and massive in the sense that the rescaled field @xmath47 converges towards a massive free field in the metric @xmath48 .\nthe mass of this free field is @xmath5 and thus exactly corresponds to minus the curvature : the more curved the space is , the more massive the gaussian fluctuations are .\nthen we investigate the possible deviations away from this hyperbolic geometry : we prove that the liouville field satisfies a large deviation principle with an explicit good rate function , the liouville action given by .\nthis rate function is non trivial , admits a unique minimum on the solution to the liouville equation with curvature @xmath5 .\nthe proof is based on computing the exact asymptotic expansion of expression when @xmath49 is the exponential of a linear function of @xmath23 : in fact , this exact expression ( see below when @xmath50 ) is the main result of this paper as all the other results stem from this equivalent . in a way\n, this shows that this hyperbolic description of the geometry of the space is rather sharp as it shows that drifting away from the liouville equation arises only with exponentially small probability .        on the other hand ,\nwe investigate the liouville action with heavy matter insertions .\nthis means that we plug @xmath51 exponential terms of the form @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) in the liouville action in order to compute the @xmath51-point correlation functions of lft .\nwe prove that the liouville field @xmath35 then concentrates on the solution of the liouville equation with sources ( where @xmath54 stands for the dirac mass at @xmath55 ) @xmath56 this equation appears when one looks for a metric with prescribed negative curvature @xmath5 and conical singularities at the points @xmath57 ( see figure [ pikedbob ] ) .\neach source @xmath58 creates a singularity with shape @xmath59 in the metric @xmath48 .\nsuch singularities are called conical as they are locally isometric to a cone with `` deficit angle '' @xmath60 ( see figure [ fig : cone ] ) .\n( -20:1 ) arc ( -20:240:1 ) ; ( -20:1 )  ( 0:0 )  ( 240:1 ) ; ( 240:0.4 ) arc ( 240:340:0.4 ) ; ( 290:0.4 ) node[below]@xmath61 ; ( 2,0 ) to[bend left ] ( 3,0 ) ; ( 4,-0.5 ) .. controls ( 4,-1 ) and ( 6,-1 ) ..

( 6,-0.5 ) ;    here again , the leading order fluctuations around this hyperbolic geometry with conical singularities are gaussian and massive in the sense that the rescaled field @xmath47 converges towards a massive free field in the metric @xmath48 , where @xmath37 is now the solution of .\nthe mass of this free field is once again minus the curvature , namely @xmath5 .\nwe also establish a large deviation principle with an explicit good rate function , which is non trivial and admits a unique minimum on the solution of the liouville equation with sources .    * conformal gravity in @xmath62 . *\nlet us stress that an analog @xmath62-conformal field theory have been studied in the physics literature ( see @xcite ) from quantized gravity .\nthe dynamics are governed by the wess - zumino action and the weyl action . basically , the underlying idea is that the @xmath62 paneitz operator is conformally covariant and yields a notion of @xmath63-curvature .\nto put it simply , we can consider the euclidean background metric so that the paneitz operator simply becomes the bilaplacian .\nthe action then becomes @xmath64\\,\\lambda({\\mathrm{d}}x),\\ ] ] which is the @xmath62 analog of in @xmath62 in flat background metric .\nthe important point for our purposes is that the corresponding free field action ( @xmath65 ) generates a log - correlated gaussian field so that our approach applies word for word . in passing\n, we mention that such a theory shares fractal properties similar to @xmath0 liouville field theory , like the geometrical kpz formula , as proved in @xcite .\nthe semiclassical limit is described in terms of the equation @xmath66 which is a prescription of constant ( negative ) @xmath63-curvature .\nthe reader may consult @xcite for more on this topic of @xmath63-uniformization of @xmath62-surfaces .\nheavy matter operators may be added as well , leading to a perturbed equation with additional sources ( i.e. dirac masses ) .\nthis approach can also be generalized to even larger dimensions by considering the conformally covariant gjms operators , which take the simple form @xmath67 in even @xmath68-dimensional flat space .\n* discussion on possible extensions or other geometries .\n* extra boundary terms @xmath69\\,d\\ell,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 stands for the length element on @xmath71 in the metric @xmath14 and @xmath72 for the geodesic curvature on @xmath71 , may be considered as well in the liouville action .\nthese boundary terms rule the behaviour of the liouville field on the boundary and gives rise to the boundary liouville field theory .\nwe will refrain from considering these extra terms here : our purpose is to expose some aspects of lft mainly to mathematicians and we wish to avoid these further complications .\nyet , this would be a first natural ( and non trivial ) extension of our work .    in this paper , we focus on the unit disk with flat or hyperbolic geometry . of particular interest\nis the construction of lft on the sphere .\nit can be constructed by taking the large @xmath73 limit of @xmath0 liouville quantum gravity on the disk with radius @xmath73 and a curvature bump on its boundary ( see @xcite ) . in that case\n, the semi - classical limit exhibits some further interesting features .\nthe point is that the limiting equations requires to construct a hyperbolic structure on the sphere , which is rather not inclined to support such a structure .\nthis can be addressed by taking care of the nature of the insertions in the surface : there are some additional constraints on the insertions @xmath74 , which are called seiberg bound in the physics literature .\nthis problem also receives a new growing interest in the community of differential geometry : the reader may consult for instance @xcite and references therein for more on this topic and other closely related topics , like the toda system .\nindeed , another natural extension of our work could be to consider the large deviations of toda field theories .\nin fact , tilting the free field measure with any nonlinear functional of the free field that yields interesting critical points for the laplace method deserves to be investigated .\nthe authors wish to address special thanks to franois david .\nthis work originates from one of the numerous discussions we have had with him , where he gave us hints to construct the liouville action on the hyperbolic disk .\nthe authors are also very indebted to andrea malchiodi and yannick sire who patiently explained to them how to deal with equation .\n* differential geometry : * the standard gradient , laplacian and lebesgue measure on ( a subdomain of ) @xmath75 are denoted by @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( and sometimes even @xmath79 ) . we will adopt the following notations related to riemannian geometry throughout the paper . on a bounded domain @xmath80 of @xmath75 , a smooth function @xmath810,\\infty[$ ] defines a scalar metric tensor by @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for the canonical inner product on @xmath75 . in what follows\n, we will denote by @xmath84 this metric tensor and sometimes , with a slight abuse of notation , identify @xmath84 with the function @xmath14 .\nwe can associate to this metric tensor a gradient @xmath15 , a laplace - beltrami operator @xmath85 , a ricci scalar curvature @xmath16 , and a volume form @xmath17 , which are defined by : @xmath86    we denote by @xmath87 the pairing of two gradients @xmath88 , @xmath89 in the metric @xmath14 , that is @xmath90    * green function and conformal maps : * the green function on a domain @xmath80 will be denoted by @xmath91 . by definition , the green function is the unique function which solves the following equation for all @xmath92 : @xmath93 note that with this convention @xmath94 where @xmath23 is a smooth function on @xmath80 ( not smooth on the whole boundary @xmath71 ) . by conformal map\n@xmath95 , we will always mean a bijective bi - holomorphic map from @xmath96 onto @xmath80 . recall that the green function is conformally invariant in the sense that @xmath97 .    * functional spaces : * @xmath98 stands for the space of smooth compactly supported functions on @xmath80 .\nwe denote @xmath99 the standard space of functions @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is integrable .\nclassically , if @xmath80 is a ( say ) smooth bounded domain , we define the space @xmath102 as the completion of @xmath98 with respect to the ( squared ) norm @xmath103 .\nlet us recall a few facts on @xmath102 and its dual @xmath104 which we need in the paper : see @xcite for instance .\nthe space @xmath104 is defined as the banach space of continuous linear functionals @xmath105 on @xmath102 equipped with the norm @xmath106 where we denote @xmath107 the distribution @xmath105 applied at @xmath23 .\nthe dual space of @xmath108 is once again a banach space , which is isometric to @xmath102 and we will make the standard abuse of notations to identify this banach space with @xmath102 .\nthe space @xmath102 can then be equipped with the weak@xmath109 topology , i.e. the topology induced by the linear functionals @xmath110 for all @xmath105 in @xmath104 : see ( * ? ? ?\n* appendix b ) .\nthis topology coincides with the standard weak topology on @xmath102 .\nwe will use this remark when establishing the large deviation principle .\nlet @xmath111 denote the probability law and expectation of a standard probability space ; the corresponding space of variables @xmath112 such that @xmath113 is integrable will be denoted by @xmath114 .\non this space , the centered gaussian free field @xmath115 with mass @xmath116 on a planar domain @xmath117 and dirichlet boundary condition is the gaussian field whose covariance function is given by the green function @xmath118 ( recall that , for @xmath119 , we denote @xmath120 ) of the problem @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a function defined on @xmath80 . when the mass satisfies @xmath123 , one usually talks about massive free fied ( mff for short ) whereas one rather uses the terminology gaussian free field ( gff for short ) for the massless field with @xmath119\n. therefore , for any smooth compactly supported functions @xmath124 on @xmath80 @xmath125=\\iint_{d\\times d } f(x)g^m_d(x , y)h(y ) { \\mathrm{d}}x{\\mathrm{d}}y.\\ ] ] almost surely , the gff lives on the space @xmath126 ( see @xcite ) .\nin fact , @xmath115 belongs to the standard sobolev space @xmath127 for all @xmath128 ( see @xcite for further details ) but for simplicity , we refrain from considering this framework .\nmany theorems of this paper could in fact be strengthened to the topology of @xmath127 ; for instance , this is the case for the large deviation result , i.e. theorem [ th : ldp ] , by using ( * ? ? ?\n* theorem 4.2.4 ) which enables to strengthen topologies in large deviation principles .\nwe could treat other boundary conditions as well but for simplicity , we restrict to the case of dirichlet boundary conditions . in the case when the action possesses boundary terms , it is more relevant to consider a gff with neumann boundary conditions in the following .    in\nwhat follows , we need to consider cut - off approximations of the gaussian free field @xmath115 on @xmath80 .\nthe cut - off may be any of the following :    -white noise ( wn ) : :    ( see @xcite ) : the green function @xmath129 on    @xmath80 can be written as    @xmath130 where    @xmath131 will denote the transition densities of the    brownian motion on @xmath80 killed upon touching    @xmath71 . a formal way to define the gaussian field    @xmath132 is to consider a white noise @xmath133 on    @xmath134 and define    @xmath135 we define the approximations    @xmath136 by integrating over    @xmath137 in instead of    @xmath138 . the covariance function for these    approximations is given by

see @xcite ) .\n-orthonormal basis expansion ( obe ) : :    ( see @xcite ) : we consider an orthonormal basis    @xmath144 of @xmath102 made up of    continuous functions and the projections of

by    @xmath147 .    in any of the above three cases\n, the family of cut - off approximations will be denoted by @xmath148 ( with @xmath149 in the case of ( obe ) ) .      for the three possible cut - off approximations @xmath148 of the gff and for @xmath150 , we consider the random measure on @xmath80 defined by @xmath151 the limit holds almost surely and is understood in the sense of weak convergence of measures .\nthis has been proved in @xcite for the cut - off family ( wn ) and ( obe ) and in @xcite for ( ca ) .\nthe limit is non trivial if and only if @xmath152 ( see @xcite ) .\nfor these three possible cutoffs , the limiting objects @xmath153 that you get by taking the limit as @xmath154 have the same law @xcite .      in the paper\nwe make extensive use of wick notation for the exponential .\nif @xmath112 is a gaussian variable with mean zero and variance @xmath155 , its wick @xmath6-th power ( @xmath156 ) is defined by @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the @xmath6-th

following expansion in wick s power @xmath164 a bit of combinatorics with wicks monomial leads to the following identity @xmath165 most of the time we will use the wick notation for gaussian fields that are distributions rather than gaussian variables , but we specify the meaning of this notation below .\nwe consider a free field @xmath115 defined on a planar domain @xmath80 ( we stress that the basics below extend without changes to any other log - correlated gaussian field ) .\nwe define the wick powers and the wick exponential as a distribution on @xmath80 , by taking the limit of cut - off approximations of @xmath115 constructed in section [ sec : cut ] . indeed from the formula , the reader can check that for any smooth function @xmath100 , and any @xmath6 the sequence    @xmath166

convergence of measures of the family @xmath170 and one can check that @xmath171 where @xmath172 denotes the conformal radius and the measure is defined in subsection [ sub : chaos ] .\nnotice that

theorem [ th : ldp ] ( use theorem [ th : liouvillesource ] and corollary [ th : liouvillesource2 ] to study the rate function ) .\nin this section , we take the occasion to explain how to construct the liouville theory on a hyperbolic riemann surface in order to show the interaction between the liouville potential and the curvature of the background metric .\nit is thus natural to consider the unit disk @xmath42 equipped with the hyperbolic ( or poincar ) scalar tensor @xmath520 or any conformal reparametrization of such a metric space .\nthis is the prototype of two dimensional riemann surface with constant negative ricci scalar curvature @xmath521 .\nthere is a subtlety in the choice of such a background structure : keep in mind that the liouville quantum field theory is intrinsically of negative curvature and thus well fitted for negatively curved background metrics .\nother choices of background structures lead to further complications that we do not want to tackle here .\nthe organization of this section is the following .\nwe first introduce some necessary background about `` background metrics '' and `` free fields in curved spaces '' .\nthen we will introduce the interaction term of lft .\nthis will allow us to define the law of the liouville field and the associated random metrics .\nfinally we discuss some properties of such a theory like the conformal invariance and the kpz formulae .\nlet us consider a domain @xmath80 of @xmath75 equipped with a smooth metric tensor @xmath522 .\nlet us consider another domain @xmath96 .\nif @xmath96 is another domain and @xmath95 is a conformal map , we wish to reparametrize the metric on @xmath80 by @xmath96 via the change of coordinates @xmath523 for @xmath524 and @xmath525 .\nthe transformation rule tells us that the metric on @xmath96 , when parametrized by @xmath80 using the map @xmath526 , takes the form @xmath527 the volume form is given by @xmath528 where @xmath529 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath96 . you can also decide to parametrize this metric space by @xmath80 in which case the volume form is given by @xmath530 .\nnote that we have the following relation @xmath531 which ensures consistency , i.e. the integral of @xmath105 and @xmath532 are the same .\nthe above relation says that @xmath533 is the image of @xmath534 by the map @xmath535 .\nrecall that when @xmath536 is a measure on @xmath96 then the image @xmath537 of @xmath536 by @xmath535 is the measure which satisfies @xmath538    now we recall the conformal invariance property of the green function . on the domain @xmath80\n, we consider the green function @xmath539 of the problem @xmath540 if @xmath95 is a conformal map and if we equip @xmath96 with the metric @xmath541 then the green function @xmath542 of the problem @xmath543 satisfies the relation @xmath544 furthermore , the green function on @xmath80 does not depend on the smooth function @xmath545 .\nin particular , if @xmath96 is any domain conformally equivalent to the unit disk @xmath42 via a map @xmath546 then @xmath547 where @xmath548 is the green function of the problem @xmath549      since the green function does not depend on the scalar metric tensor @xmath550 on the domain @xmath80 , the law of the centered gff @xmath551 on @xmath80 in the metric @xmath550 is that of a standard centered gff @xmath552 on @xmath80 ( i.e. in the flat metric ) .\nbecause of , we have for all domain @xmath96 conformally equivalent to @xmath80 via @xmath95 the following equality in law in the sense of ( schwartz ) distributions @xmath553 therefore , we can define simultaneously the gff on every domain @xmath96 conformally equivalent to @xmath42 by setting @xmath554 for a given gff on @xmath42 with dirichlet boundary condition .\nnow we focus on the free field action in curved space , i.e. formally @xmath555 \\,d\\lambda_{\\hat{g}_{d}}\\ ] ] because this turns the field @xmath23 into a shifted gaussian free field . by plugging the exact value @xmath556 of the curvature in this action and by performing a formal integration by parts\n, one can see that the field @xmath23 has the law of a gff on @xmath80 with mean given by @xmath557 .\nso we consider a centered gff @xmath115 on @xmath80 with dirichlet boundary condition and we set @xmath558 .\nobserve that our notation may appear misleading at first sight .\nthe index @xmath80 seems to indicate that the law of the field @xmath559 only depends on the domain @xmath80 .\nactually , it depends on the couple @xmath560 .\nkeep in mind this dependence in the following .\nlet @xmath96 be another domain and @xmath95 is a conformal map . by using the relation between scalar metric tensors\n@xmath561 , we have the relation in law @xmath562 therefore , we get the following reparametrization rule @xmath563 when switching from a domain @xmath80 to another domain @xmath96 . this relation is standard in the physics literature as well as fundamental in the following .\nthe interaction term in the liouville action is the term @xmath564 in .\nwe will see that under the conditions @xmath18 with @xmath190,2]$ ] , this term is conformally invariant under the reparametrization rule and actually , it turns out that these are the only possible values to get a conformally invariant theory when restricted to the case @xmath190,2]$ ] .    in\nwhat follows , we will restrict to the case when @xmath565 or any conformal reparametrization of such a metric space .\nthe field @xmath566 will stand for the free field in the curved space @xmath567 as described in subsection [ sub : curve ] . in\nwhat follows , the random measure @xmath568 is constructed as explained in subsection [ sub : chaos ] as the almost sure limit in the sense of weak convergence of measures @xmath569 where @xmath570 and @xmath148 is any of the cut - off family of the free field @xmath115 on @xmath42 discussed in subsection [ sub : chaos ] .\nit is plain to see that @xmath571 recall that , when @xmath572 , a further @xmath573 renormalizing term is needed in the above limit ( see @xcite ) .    for any conformal map @xmath574\n, we define @xmath575 the interaction term @xmath576 on @xmath80 is then define similarly to .\nwe stress that the law of the limiting measure together with the field @xmath23 does not depend on the chosen cut - off approximation among ( wn ) or ( ca ) or ( obe ) .\nactually this uniqueness in law holds at a more general level ( see @xcite ) .\nit may be worth stressing here that gaussian multiplicative chaos theory allows us to define the measure @xmath568 on @xmath42 but it is not clear whether this measure assigns a finite mass to the whole set @xmath42 , especially because @xmath577 .\nyet we claim    [ mass ] almost surely , we have @xmath578    _ proof . _ for @xmath152 , the chaos representation entails that @xmath579=\\int_{{\\mathbb{u } } }

the unit disk is almost surely finite as it is plain to check that the latter quantity is finite . for @xmath572 ,\nthe expectation of the measure @xmath580}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}x$ ] is not finite ( see @xcite ) so that the above argument does not directly applies .\nyet , it is possible to use this argument to the truncated measure at level @xmath581 , call it @xmath582 , as considered in @xcite .\nsince this measure coincides with @xmath583 for @xmath581 ( random ) large enough , the statement follows for @xmath572 . as we do not want to introduce here all the background of cutlines at level @xmath581 for the only purpose of proving proposition [ mass ] , details are left to the reader\nnow we focus on the conformal invariance properties of the interaction term .\nthe natural idea to construct the liouville action ( including the interaction term ) is then to tilt the free field measure with the term @xmath584 .\nhowever , liouville field theory is a conformal field theory and , regarding to this point , it is important to check first that the measure @xmath576 is conformally invariant .\nactually , this point is crucial because requiring this measure to be conformally invariant is equivalent to fixing the value of @xmath63 in terms of @xmath2 .    roughly speaking , the measure @xmath576 is expected to stand for the volume form of some `` quantum metric '' parameterized by @xmath560 ( here the hyperbolic metric ) .\nto be intrinsic , the law of this quantum metric must be insensitive to the choice of any conformally equivalent reparametrization of @xmath560 .\na conformal reparametrization of @xmath80 is nothing but a pullback metric @xmath585 on another domain @xmath96 via a conformal @xmath95 .\nthis pullback metric induces local deformations of the curvature and therefore another structure for the associated free field on curved space .\nthe change of the law of the free field is exactly quantified by the reparametrization rule .\nat least heuristically , by writing @xmath143 for the local coordinates on @xmath80 and @xmath535 for the local coordinates on @xmath96 , we have @xmath586 provided that @xmath587 , which is exactly the content of the parametrization rule .\nthere is no difficulty in making a rigorous statement out of this and we claim    [ interactionci ] the measure @xmath588 is conformally invariant .\nmore precisely , given a conformal map @xmath574 , we consider the random measure on @xmath80 @xmath589 this measure has the same law as the push forward of the measure @xmath590 to @xmath80 along @xmath535 . furthermore ,\nif we construct the field @xmath559 with the help of the centered gff @xmath591 on @xmath80 then equality holds not only in law but also almost surely .\nwe consider a cosmological constant @xmath179 and a liouville conformal factor @xmath1800,2]$ ] .\nwe set @xmath181    [ disklqg ] we define the law @xmath592 of the liouville field @xmath559 on @xmath560

@xmath595\\ ] ] and @xmath24 is any bounded continuous functional on @xmath104 .    observe that this definition perfectly makes sense as we have seen that the integral @xmath596 appearing in the above expectations is almost surely finite .\nfurthermore , we stress that the law of this field corresponds to the liouville action . also ,\nas a consequence of proposition [ interactionci ] , we claim    * ( conformal invariance)*[lfci ] for any conformal map @xmath95 , the law under @xmath597 of the random distribution @xmath598 on @xmath96 is the same as the law of @xmath599 under @xmath597 .\none of the main issue in liouville theory is the study of metrics on @xmath42 defined for @xmath6000,2]$ ] by @xmath601 where @xmath566 is the liouville field with parameters @xmath179 , @xmath1800,2]$ ] and @xmath602 stands for the euclidean metric on @xmath42 .\nabsolute continuity of the law of the liouville field with respect to the law of the gff on @xmath42 with dirichlet boundary conditions is convenient to extend properties that are true almost surely with respect to the free field law ( when you switch off the interaction term , i.e. @xmath65 ) to the general case of non critical lft ( when you switch on the interaction term , i.e. @xmath603 ) .\nthis is the case of the existence of the metric , which we explain below . by metric , we mean volume form , brownian motion , semi - group , laplace - beltrami operator and existence of a heat kernel associated to @xmath235 .\nit just suffices to tilt the law of the object constructed in the free field context ( @xmath65 ) by the term @xmath604 .\nwe first illustrate our claims with the construction of the volume form . in the case @xmath65 and @xmath6000,2[$ ] , we know from subsection [ sub : chaos ] that the family @xmath605 almost surely weakly converges towards a random measure , which we call @xmath606 on @xmath42 . by absolute continuity of the law of the liouville field with respect to the gff law , we deduce that , under @xmath607 , the family @xmath608 almost surely weakly converges towards the same random measure @xmath606 .\nhowever , observe that , for @xmath603 , the law of @xmath606 under @xmath184 ( the law of the gff @xmath115 ) differs from its law under the probability measure @xmath607 . also , the measure @xmath606 is atomless under @xmath607 as it is under @xmath184 .\nconcerning the liouville brownian motion , the construction of @xcite can be adapted as follows .\nwe consider a standard planar brownian motion @xmath10 on @xmath75 . for @xmath609 ,\nwe set @xmath610 and @xmath611 then we define the increasing additive functional @xmath612 as the almost sure limit @xmath613 similarly to the volume form , one can check that the limit is equal to @xmath614}\\,\\nu_{t\\wedge \\tau_x^{\\mathbb{u}}}(dz),\\ ] ] where @xmath615 is the occupation measure of the brownian motion @xmath616 up to time @xmath617 .\nthis pcaf can be extended to the whole of @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. can be defined almost surely for all starting point @xmath609 .\nthis extension , still denoted by @xmath618 , is continuous and strictly increasing up to time @xmath619 .\nwe denote by @xmath620 the reciprocal function and we set @xmath621 .\nthe liouville brownian motion @xmath622 is then defined as @xmath623 this construction is carried out in @xcite for @xmath65 . for @xmath624 , the law of the liouville brownian motion is nothing but the law of @xmath625 under the probability measure @xmath607 . by adapting the argument of the volume form , it is plain to see that the liouville brownian motion @xmath626 is conformally invariant under the reparametrization rule .\none can also follow @xcite to construct the associated semi - group , laplace - beltrami operator , heat kernel , resolvent and dirichlet form by using the argument of absolute continuity .\nwe can also claim that the spectral dimension of the metric @xmath627 is @xmath628 for @xmath6000,2[$ ] , @xmath190,2]$ ] and @xmath179 with the help of @xcite .\nlet us just stress that the case @xmath629 is technically more subtle and one must state properly the properties of the metric @xmath627 as explained in @xcite .\nlet us just stress that all the results established in section [ sec : semi ] excepted that you replace the classical liouville equation in flat space by the she equation in curved space @xmath630    the same remark holds for section [ sec : heavy ] where you replace by @xmath631      here we study how the measure @xmath632 changes under conformal reparametrization . to quantify this change ,\nwe will introduce the notion of conformal weight .\nrecall that the liouville field can be simultaneously defined on all the domains @xmath80 conformally equivalent to @xmath42 via a conformal map @xmath535 by @xmath633    * ( conformal weight ) * the conformal weight of the ( spinless ) operator @xmath634 is defined as the exponent @xmath635 such that @xmath636    the conformal weight of the operator @xmath637 is given by @xmath638    this is a rather elementary computation in the same spirit as the proof of proposition [ interactionci ] .\nthe proof is thus left as an exercise .\nwe stress that conformal invariance is equivalent to having conformal weight @xmath259 .\nwe thus recover the fact that the operator @xmath634 is conformally invariant only for @xmath639 .        in this section\n, we explain the kpz formula @xcite , at least as formulated in @xcite ( or @xcite ; see also @xcite for another formulation ) .\nthe geometrical kpz formula is a relation between the hausdorff dimensions of a given set @xmath640 as measured by the lebesgue measure or the random measure @xmath632 .\nrecall that , given an atomless radon measure @xmath641 on @xmath80 and @xmath642 $ ] , we define @xmath643 where the infimum runs over all the coverings @xmath644 of @xmath218 with closed euclidean balls ( non necessarily centered at @xmath218 ) with radius @xmath645 .\nwe define the @xmath646-dimensional @xmath641-hausdorff measure : @xmath647 the limit exists but may be infinite and defines a metric outer measure on the @xmath155-field of @xmath648-measurable subsets of @xmath80 , which contains all the borel sets .\nthe @xmath641-hausdorff dimension of the set @xmath218 is then defined as the value @xmath649 notice that @xmath650 $ ] and a ( non standard ) frostman lemma can be proved to characterize the @xmath641-hausdorff dimension .    in\nwhat follows , given a compact set @xmath438 of @xmath80 , we define its hausdorff

binaries with orbital periods of days to years and separations under 10 au @xcite , to marginally bound _ wide binaries _ with orbital periods @xmath14 yr and separations up to 20,000 au ( 0.1 parsec ) or more @xcite . the frequency of stellar binaries , and the statistics of their physical properties ( periods , mass ratios , eccentricities ) provide constraints on theoretical models of star formation @xcite .\nbinaries are very common in the galaxy , with various estimates of their frequency hovering around 50% of all stellar systems .\nthe distribution in orbital periods @xmath15 has been estimated over several orders of magnitude , from days to millions of years , in the classical papers by @xcite and @xcite .\nthe orbital period distribution of spectroscopic doubles was also re - estimated more recently by @xcite .\nthere appears to be a general consensus in the literature for an orbital period distribution which is uniform in @xmath16 over several orders of magnitude .\nthe orbital period distribution is traditionally modeled with a power law @xmath17 , sometimes referred to as _\npik s law _\nafter @xcite ; an equivalent form uses the orbital separation of the components @xmath18 .\nthis empirical law breaks down both at very short orbital periods @xcite , and at large orbital separations @xcite , where the binary frequency is found to drop .\nthe observed distribution of _ wide binaries _ is of particular interest , because the low binding energy of these systems makes them susceptible to disruption .\ntheoretical models suggest that marginally bound systems in the galactic disk will dissolve over timescales comparable with the age of the galaxy through repeated , separate encounters with field stars , giant molecular clouds , or hypothetical dark matter bodies @xcite .\nsince the probability of a system to become disrupted increases with component separation , it is expected that an evolved population of wide binaries will exhibit a break in its distribution at large orbital separations .\nhence even a population whose initial distribution strictly following pik s law ( @xmath18 ) will end up with a truncated distribution , with @xmath19 breaking down to a steeper power law ( @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) beyond some orbital separation limit .\nthe specific form of @xmath19 will be a function of both the age and interaction history of the binary population under study\n. samples of wide binaries can thus be used as probes of the environments of various populations of objects . to investigate these statistical effects\n, it is however desirable to assemble _ large samples _ of wide binary systems .\nmuch can also be learned by assembling and comparing samples drawn from a variety of populations and stellar subtypes @xcite .\nthe classical method to find wide binaries is to search for pairs of stars with small angular separations on the sky .\nthe main problem is to distinguish between _ physical pairs _ ,\ni.e. genuine resolved binary stars , and _ optical pairs _ , which are chance alignments of unrelated stars along the line of sight .\nwhile all physical binaries should ultimately be confirmed through the detection of their orbital motion , this is generally impractical for wide binaries with orbital periods of @xmath22 years or longer .\nwide binaries are thus generally identified based of probability arguments .\nbesides angular separations , other observables are useful is assessing the status of candidate wide binaries .\nparallax measurements are perhaps the most useful , when they exist ; orbital separations are expected to be @xmath23 pc , so both component should have very nearly identical parallaxes .\nwide binaries are also expected to have orbital velocities @xmath24 km s@xmath1 , so their radial velocities should be nearly identical , as well as their proper motion vectors . while radial velocities are efficient at separating out physical and optical pairs at any distance range , parallaxes and proper motions are most useful at small radial distances , where their relative accuracies are higher .\none identifies in the literature two distinct approaches in identifying wide binaries .\none approach attempts to identify distant wide binaries in deep imaging surveys using statical arguments based on angular separations alone .\na classical example is the two - point correlation method elaborated by @xcite .\ntheir analysis of deep images of north galactic pole demonstrated an excess of pairs with small angular separations , compared to what one would expect from a random distribution of single stars .\nradial velocity measurements have been used to confirm the binary status of the candidates @xcite .\nthis , and other similar surveys @xcite , have however yielded only limited samples of wide binaries .\nthe second , more successful , approach is based on a search for wide binaries among catalogs of stars with large proper motions . in such catalogs ,\nwide binaries are expected to be found as _\ncommon proper motion _ ( cpm ) doubles .\nthis method has been expanded to a considerable extent by w. j. @xcite .\nhis _ lds catalogue _ @xcite , contains over 6,200 wide binaries , with proper motions @xmath25 yr@xmath1 . searching for wide binaries among high proper motion stars has several advantages .\nsuch stars tend to be relatively nearby ( @xmath26 pc ) , which means that wide binaries with orbital separations as small as @xmath27 au will generally be resolved in most imaging surveys , including archived photographic plate .\nthe proximity of the high proper motion population also makes it easier to identify _ intrinsically faint _ companions , such as m dwarfs or brown dwarfs .\nhigh proper motion stars are also generally within range of accurate parallax measurements , which ultimately provide the most stringent test of the binary star status of the components .    unfortunately , a complete catalog of all the high proper motion stars surveyed for cpm companions was never published by luyten , leaving no data on the parent population . in particular , it must be emphasized that the lds catalog is not a subsample of the _ nltt catalog _ @xcite ; the nltt catalog compiles only the fastest stars identified by luyten ( @xmath28 yr@xmath1 ) and @xmath29 of the lds pairs have proper motions below the nltt limit\n. other limitations of both the lds and nltt catalogs include ( 1 ) a limited precision in the tabulated proper motions @xcite which leaves significant uncertainties on some of the pairings , and ( 2 ) a photographic magnitude system ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) which does not yield reliable photometric distances for red dwarfs @xcite .\nboth the lds and nltt catalogs also suffer from incompleteness , particularly in areas of high stellar densities such as in milky way fields , and also at faint ( @xmath32 ) magnitudes .\nnevertheless , the lds and nltt catalogs still provide ample opportunities to conduct additional surveys and analyses of wide binary systems , and one can argue that they have remained under - utilized in this respect . a successful use of the luyten catalogs is demonstrated by @xcite , who surveyed a well - defined sample of @xmath33 high proper motion objects , identifying and analyzing 122 cpm companions .    a more systematic search for wide binaries using the luyten catalogs was made possible with the release of the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) assembled by @xcite .\nthe rnltt is based on the re - identification of nltt stars in the usno - a catalog @xcite and in the 2mass _ second incremental release _\nthis fixed some of the main limitations of the nltt by providing significantly more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes .\nadditionally , the new optical - to - infrared colors make it possible to separate out white dwarfs , disk dwarfs , and halo subdwarfs in a reduced proper motion diagram @xcite . a complete analysis of the rnltt yielded an expanded list of 1124 cpm doubles @xcite , including clearly defined samples of wide binaries from both the local disk and local halo populations .\nthese samples suggest that the distribution in orbital separations in both disk and halo wide binaries is consistent with a power law distribution of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 , significantly different from pik s law ( @xmath36 ) .\nperhaps the most interesting cpm doubles are those for which at least one component is a star listed in the _ hipparcos _ catalog . a systematic search of both the nltt and rnltt by @xcite  hereafter gc04  has yielded 424 such pairs .\nthe identification of a distant , faint companion to a _ hipparcos _\nstar automatically yields a high - quality parallax for the faint secondary , which can be critical in mapping the color - magnitude relationship of low - luminosity stars @xcite .\nbut perhaps the most interesting feature for the investigation of wide binaries is that an accurate parallax also yields an accurate measurement of the projected _ physical separation _ between the two components , which can be more directly compared with theoretical models .    the new lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motion @xmath0\nyr@xmath1 @xcite now provides a fresh opportunity to expand the census of cpm doubles , including systems with _ hipparcos\n_ primaries .\nthe lspm - north catalog is based on a re - analysis of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) with the superblink software , which used an image - subtraction algorithm to achieve a high detection rate for stars with significant proper motions .\nthe catalog covers the entire hemisphere north of the j2000 celestial equator ( decl.@xmath370 ) .\nit is is estimated to be @xmath38 complete over the entire northern sky down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 . in fields at high galactic latitude ( @xmath40 ) ,\nits completeness is @xmath41 .\nthe lspm - north also has a lower proper motion limit than the nltt catalog ( 0.15@xmath42 yr@xmath1 , compared with 0.18@xmath42 yr@xmath1 ) .\nnearly half ( 30,616 ) of its 61,977 recorded high proper motion stars are not listed in the nltt . just like the rnltt\n, the lspm - north provides more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes , and also gives optical - to - infrared colors .    in paper\ni , we demonstrated the potential for using the superblink database to find new cpm companions , reporting the discovery of 5 new companions of known nearby stars @xcite . in this second paper , we capitalize on the very high completeness of the lspm - north to obtain a statistically complete census of faint cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars .\nour methodology for identifying cpm doubles is described in  2 , our resulting census of cpm pairs is presented in  3 and 4 , a statistically complete sample of wide binaries is defined and analyzed in  5 , the main results are summarized in the conclusion (  6 ) .\ncommon proper motion ( cpm ) doubles are , by definition , resolved pairs of stars which have similar proper motions , both in magnitude and orientation .\nthey typically have angular separations ranging from several arcseconds to several arcminutes .\nthey are assumed to be the resolved components of wide binary systems .\nas such , they are also expected to orbit around their common center of mass and display orbital motion .\ncpm doubles are thus not expected to have _ identical _ proper motion vectors , since the orbital motion will result in a small relative proper motion between the components of the pair . in most cases , however , the orbital period will be large enough ( @xmath43 yr ) that the relative proper motion between the stars will be negligible on timescales of years to decades .\nmodern proper motion measurements will thus be comparable to within the measurement errors .\npairs of high proper motion stars resulting from a chance alignment , on the other hand , will generally have different proper motions , although there remains a small probability that a few will , by chance , also have similar proper motions ( although they may lie at very different distances ) .\nthe formal identification of a cpm pair as a wide binary thus requires one to weight in the probability for a common proper motion pair to be a chance alignment .\nconsider two stars at angular positions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 refers to the right ascension and @xmath47 to the declination on the sky .\nthese stars have proper motions @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for small angles of separation between stars 1 and 2\n, we can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can also define @xmath52 as the magnitude of the difference between the proper motion vectors : @xmath53 each pair can thus be represented in a ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space . for large numbers of pairs , one\ncan then statistically determine the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment by comparing the actual distribution of pairs in the ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space with a model of the distribution expected from chance alignments .\nthe expected distribution of chance alignments in ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space is very hard to modelize analytically for a proper motion catalog such as the lspm - north .\none complication is that the distribution of high proper motion stars is not uniform in @xmath46 and @xmath47 with some regions of the sky being more densely populated that others @xcite .\nthe distribution in proper motions @xmath54 is also not uniform .\nproper motion vectors have preferred orientations in some parts of the sky , most notably because of the asymmetric drift of thick disk and halo stars , as well as from the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest , both effects resulting in preferred orientations of the proper motion vectors in specific parts of the sky .\nalso , the density of objects increases as the proper motion decreases , with very high proper motion stars being rare and low proper motion stars more common .\nit is however possible to obtain an empirical model of the density of chance alignments in @xmath50,@xmath52 phase space .\none can picture the calculation of all the @xmath50 as a comparison between the positions of all stars in two sets of objects : set # 1 with positions @xmath44 , and set # 2 with positions @xmath45 .\nwe calculate the angular distance separating each individual object in set # 2 from each individual object in set # 1 .\nassuming there are @xmath55 objects in set # 1 and @xmath56 objects in set # 2 , then we have @xmath57 pairings .\nwhat we are interested in is the special case where the primary star is a _ hipparcos _\nset # 1 is thus the subset of lspm - north stars with a _ hipparcos _\ncounterpart ( 4,839 objects ) , while subset # 2 comprises the entire lspm - north catalog ( 61,976 objects ) .\nit is possible to modify the dataset and simulate a situation where no genuine cpm pairs would be found , only chance alignments .\nlet s redefine the angular separation @xmath50 as : @xmath58_{sim}= ( ( \\alpha_1-[\\alpha_2-\\theta])^{2 }    \\cos{(\\delta_1)}^{2}+(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)^{2 } ) ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] this is equivalent to displacing all stars in set # 2 by an angle @xmath59 in the direction of right ascension , prior to calculating angular separations .\nthis procedure effectively eliminates all pairings of genuine cpm doubles ( since the second star of the pair is now moved out the way by some angular distance @xmath59 ) while leaving intact the statistics of the chance alignments .\nthe procedure can be illustrated with a ballroom analogy .\nimagine a crowd of men and women attending a dance function in a large ballroom .\nassume that a few of the attendees are married couples , while the rest are singles .\nlet s say initially all the dancers are scattered around the ballroom at random , but with all the married couples holding hands .\npeople would be found in pairs , some because they are married couples , but other simply by chance . at a specified time\n, an announcer commands all the men to walk ten steps to their right .\nafter this , new pairings of people would have been made , but this time none of them would be married couples , all would be chance pairings . if we were to calculate how many pairs there were initially , and subtract out the number of pairs after the move , then we would have a good estimate of how many married couples are attending the dance .\nthe distribution of all pairs in the @xmath60,@xmath52 thus effectively simulates a distribution of pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_. the displacement angle @xmath59 should be large enough that all cpm doubles are well separated , i.e. , larger than the typical angular separation between cpm pairs .\nhowever , @xmath59 should not be too large because we need to simulate pairing made within areas of the sky that have similar densities and proper motion systematics .\nwe use values of @xmath59 between 1 and 5 degrees .    in figure 1\n, we compare the distribution in @xmath50,@xmath52 phase space for lspm - north pairs with distributions of pairs in the simulated @xmath60,@xmath52 phase space .\nthe left panels show the distribution of pairs with _ hipparcos _\nprimaries , while the right panels shows simulations calculated with @xmath59 = 1 degree .\nthe distributions are split in three different groups , depending on the mean proper motion @xmath61 of the pairs , @xmath62yr@xmath63yr@xmath1 ( top ) , @xmath64yr@xmath65yr@xmath1 ( middle ) , and @xmath66yr@xmath67yr@xmath1 ( bottom ) .\nthe panels to the right display the results of the chance alignment simulations ( i.e. with set # 2 translated by an angle @xmath59 ) , and for comparable ranges of @xmath61 .\nthe most striking difference between the data and the simulations are the number of pairs found in the lower left corner of each diagram , corresponding to small angular separations _ and _ small proper motion differences .\nvery few pairs are found in the simulations , but the data shows a large concentration of objects in that range .\nthis concentration of objects in the data can only be interpreted as the signature from a population of common proper motion binaries .\npairs of stars found in that region of the parameter space are thus most likely to be genuine physical doubles .\nthe density of chance alignments , however , progressively increases for larger values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .\nthere exists a limit beyond which the density of chance alignment pairs exceeds that of the cpm doubles .\nthis limit can be used to objectively define a search area for wide binary systems .\nthe distribution of high proper motion stars is locally uniform in @xmath68 , so the probability of having a chance alignment , for small values of @xmath50 , is directly proportional to @xmath50 . on first order\n, one also expects the probability of a chance alignment to increase proportionally to @xmath52 , again for small values of @xmath52 .\nthus , for small values of both @xmath50 and @xmath52 the probability of a chance alignment is expected to be proportional to @xmath69 . in the lspm - north catalog ,\nthe distribution of high proper motion stars empirically follows n(@xmath61)d@xmath70d@xmath61 , where @xmath71 . from that\n, we infer that the number density of chance alignments @xmath72 in @xmath73 phase space must follow : @xmath74 for small values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .    to determine the range within which a data pair is most likely to be a cpm double\n, we define the variable : @xmath75^{0.5},\\ ] ] which includes a normalization of the proper motions to the lower limit of the lspm - north catalog ( 0.15@xmath42 yr@xmath1 ) .\nthis new variable is deliberately set up so that the number density of chance alignment pairs increases _ linearly _ with @xmath76 ( hence the square root in eq .\nthis helps in modelizing the contribution from chance alignments , whose density should increase linearly with @xmath77 .\nwe compare the number density distribution of pairs @xmath78 in the data with the mean distribution of simulated , chance alignment pairs @xmath79 , averaged from 20 different simulations .\nthe result is displayed in figure 2 . for small values of @xmath76 ,\ncorresponding to small angular distances @xmath50 and/or small differences in proper motion @xmath52 , one finds that @xmath80 , which means that there is a high probability for any pair found in that range to be a cpm double .\nwe find that @xmath72 increases linearly with @xmath76 , as expected , while @xmath81 steadfastly decreases when @xmath76 increases , up to a point where @xmath72 begins to dominate .\nthe bottom panel in figure 2 estimates the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment , as a function of the variable @xmath76 .\nwe find that beyond @xmath82 the probability of a pair to be a chance alignment exceeds 50% .\nwe thus use @xmath82 as the upper limit in our search for cpm doubles .\nwe select as wide binary candidate any pair for which @xmath83 , which is equivalent to selecting pairs which satisfy the condition : @xmath84 where @xmath50 is expressed in seconds of arc , and @xmath52 is in seconds of arc per year .\nthe location of this boundary is illustrated in figure 1 for @xmath85yr@xmath1 ( top ) , @xmath86yr@xmath1 ( middle ) , and @xmath87yr@xmath1 ( bottom ) .\nnote that the boundary is a function of the mean proper motion ( @xmath61 ) of the pair , which means that pairs with large proper motions are selected over a larger range in @xmath50 and @xmath52 .\nthe boundary rises to high values of @xmath52 at very small angular separations , setting an unrealistically high limit for the detection of wide binaries , whose proper motions should be very similar in any case .\nwe thus add the following constraint : @xmath88 this large , arbitrary limit ensures that no pairs with very different proper motions will make the cut , even if they happen to have very small angular separations .\nthe majority of pairs found in the lspm - north are at distances @xmath89pc , and have projected separations @xmath90au ( see  3,4 below ) ; a difference in proper motion @xmath91mas would imply an orbital velocity @xmath92 km s@xmath1 which would be unrealistically large for any system with @xmath90au .\nwe also set an upper limit to the range of angular separations : @xmath93 this limits the search to a reasonable range in @xmath50 . beyond this limit ,\nthe constraints on @xmath52 from eq.7 become so stringent that the allowed range in @xmath52 falls well below the measurement errors , thus losing all practicality .\nthe search area bounded by eqs.6,7,8 should include the vast majority of genuine wide binaries , with minimal contamination from chance alignment pairs . a small level of contamination is still expected , particularly for pairs selected near the boundaries .\nbased on our simulations of chance alignments , we estimate the contamination in the entire search area to be @xmath94 pairs , or @xmath95 of the total sample .\nusing the selection method discussed above , we searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm binaries in which both the primary and secondary ( and tertiary ) are _ hipparcos _ stars .\nwe identified a total of 168 such cpm pairs with angular separations @xmath96 , arranged into 158 doubles and 5 triples .\nfigure 3 shows the distribution in @xmath73 for the 163 systems selected as most likely to be wide binaries / multiples ( open and filled circles ) .\nfig.3 also shows the @xmath73 distribution of pairs that did not fall within our selection limits , and thus identified as most likely to be chance alignments ( open and filled triangles ) .\nthese pairs of _ hipparcos _ stars make an excellent case study for our wide binary search algorithm because the _ hipparcos _ catalog provides accurate and independent measurements of their parallaxes , which allow us to verify if the two components indeed physically associated .\noverall , we find that all except 2 of the pair have the parallax of the primary and secondary within 2.0@xmath97 of the measurement errors . for the 2 pairs with mismatched distances , we can only conclude that they are chance alignments .\nthese pairs are represented in fig.3 a open circles ( bottom panel ) .\none of the rejected pairs is formed of lspm j0722 + 0849s ( hip 35756 ) and lspm j0722 + 0854 ( hip 35750 ) , and has an angular separation of 302@xmath42 .\nthe alleged primary has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath98mas , while the secondary has @xmath99mas .\nthe two parallax measurements are thus significantly different .\nwe note that the difference in proper motion @xmath52 is also substantial , and it is thus not a surprise that the two should come out as chance alignments .\nthe pair was initially selected by our algorithm is mainly because of the relatively large proper motion of the two stars ( @xmath100 yr@xmath1 ) , which makes this alignment a rare event given the relative scarcity of stars with very large proper motions .\nthis pair was similarly identified as a chance alignment by @xcite .\nthe other rejected pair consists of lspm j1826 + 0846 ( hip 90355 ) and lspm j1826 + 0836 ( hip 90365 ) , with an angular separation of 608@xmath42 .\nthe first star has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath101mas , while the second star has a parallax @xmath102mas .\nagain , the large difference between the two values indicates that the two are physically unrelated . here\n, however , it comes out more as a surprise because the two stars have proper motion vectors within only 4 mas yr@xmath1 of each other .\nthis striking alignment of both angular positions and proper motion vectors serves as a good warning about the possibility of having physically unrelated stars come up as apparent cpm doubles .\nwe also examined all pairs rejected in the initial cut , and with angular separations @xmath103 , to see if additional cpm binaries could be recovered based on their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .\nthis is one way to check that the algorithm does a good job at picking out most of the genuine wide binaries .\nan examination of the parallaxes of the primaries and secondaries in 55 pairs with @xmath104 ( all rejected on the first pass ) reveals the existence of two pairs that are indeed consistent with being cpm doubles .\nmore specifically , the parallaxes of the individual components in each of these pairs are consistent with the two stars being at the same distance . in each of them , the parallaxes of both\nthe primary and secondary are better than 10% accurate , and the difference between the parallax of the primary and secondary was smaller than the quoted measurement error .\nwe have added these two pairs to our list of cpm doubles . in fig.3 , they are plotted as filled triangles .\nnote that both pairs have fairly small difference in their proper motion , which is also consistent with the components forming physical pairs .\none of the two very wide pairs is composed of the @xmath105 star hip 53791 with the @xmath106 star hip 53756 at a separation @xmath107 .\nthe two stars have @xmath108 parallaxes @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .\nthe second pair consists of the @xmath111 star hip 75104 with the @xmath112 star hip 75011 .\nthe very large separation between the two components ( @xmath113 ) raises suspicion about their physical association , but the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are a near perfect match , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a distance of 44\npc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .\nit is interesting to note that the 2 genuine doubles found among the 55 pairs that were initially rejected suggest that a few percent of the pairs rejected in our search algorithm are likely to be true doubles .\nthis emphasizes the limitations of our statistical method in making a complete identification of wide cpm doubles , especially of those with very large angular separations . \"\ntable 1 gives a list of the 158 doubles and 5 triples ultimately selected as wide binary systems .\nthe table give the lspm catalog number of the primary ( column 1 ) , the _ hipparcos _ catalog number of the primary ( 2 ) , its right ascension ( 3 ) , its declination ( 4 ) , its proper motion in the direction or r.a . and in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 5 ) , its proper motion in the direction of decl .\nalso in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 6 ) , its apparent @xmath117 magnitude ( 7 ) , its @xmath118 optical - to - infrared color ( 8) , its parallax in milliarcseconds ( 9 ) , the estimated parallax error in milliarcseconds ( 10 ) , the angular separation between the primary and secondary in @xmath42 ( 11 ) , all followed by the lspm catalog number of\nthe secondary ( 12 ) , the _ hipparcos _ catalog number of the secondary ( 13 ) , its right ascension ( 14 ) , its declination ( 15 ) , its proper motion in the direction or r.a . and in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 16 ) , its proper motion in the direction of decl . in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 17 ) , its apparent @xmath117 magnitude ( 18 ) , its @xmath118 optical - to - infrared color ( 19 ) , its parallax in milliarcseconds ( 20 ) , and finally the estimated parallax error for the secondary in milliarcseconds ( 21 ) . in table 1 , each of the 5 triple systems is represented by two separate ( out of the possible three ) pairings .\nthe triples all consist of one short separation pair with an additional component at larger separations .\nthe short separation pair is listed in table 1 .\nthe large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair .\neach triple is thus referenced as one short period pair and one long period pair .\nwe find that of the 158 doubles and 5 triples reported here , only 80 of the doubles ( and none of the triples ) had been previously reported in gc04 .\na little more than half the systems in our list are thus `` new '' cpm systems .\nusing again the method described in  2 , we the searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm multiples consisting of one _ hipparcos _ star with one or more non-_hipparcos _ companions .\nwe identified a total of 347 cpm doubles , 10 triples , and 1 quadruple system .\nall systems are listed in table 2 .\nfigure 4 shows the distribution in @xmath73 for all the pairs found with separations @xmath119 .\npairs selected as probable cpm doubles are displayed on the top panel , while the rejected pairs ( probable chance alignments ) are shown in the bottom panel .\nnote that several pairs with separations @xmath120 are found to have relative proper motions @xmath121 ; this is an artifact of the lspm - north catalog .\nthe proper motions listed in the lspm - north are based on proper motion measurements of the stars in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , derived with the superblink software @xcite .\nthe dss images are scans from the poss - i and poss - ii photographic plates .\ncompanions of _ hipparcos _ stars with separations @xmath122 are generally found within the extended wings of the bright stars , which are deeply saturated on the dss images . in those instances\nsuperblink identifies the mingled pair as a single extended , moving object , and calculates a proper motion for the pair only .\nthe individual components are usually recovered by visual inspection of either the dss scans or 2mass charts .\nbut even though the stars appear on separate entries in the lspm - north , the catalog lists the superblink - calculated proper motion of the _ pair _ for both the primary and secondary . since\ntheir proper motions are listed as exactly the same , one gets @xmath121 for those pairs .\nwe have verified each of those pairs individually using our superblink - generated finding charts , and confirmed that in every case the two stars do indeed have very similar proper motions , so it is very unlikely that any of those pairs could be chance alignments , and their initial identification as cpm doubles is valid .      because we lack parallax measurements for the non-_hipparcos _ secondaries , it is not possible to verify the binary status of these pairs by direct comparison of their measured distances , as we did in  3 .\nanother test , however , is to check that the color and magnitude of the secondary is at least consistent with the star being at the same distance from the sun as its primary .\nthis is equivalent to comparing the parallax distance of the primary with the photometric distance of the secondary . we can plot the secondary star in a color - magnitude diagram , using the parallax of the _ primary star _ to calculate its alleged absolute magnitude .\nif the two stars are indeed physically associated , then the secondary should fall on the standard main sequence , or on the white dwarf cooling sequence .\nif the secondary stars does nt fall where it should be on the color magnitude diagram , then either the secondary is really not at the same distance from the sun as the primary , and the pair is a chance alignment , or the secondary star has an absolute magnitude which does nt fit with the standard stellar loci .\ncolor magnitude diagrams for the primaries and secondaries are displayed in figure 5 . in these diagrams ,\nthe absolute magnitudes of both the primaries and secondaries are calculated using the parallaxes of the _ hipparcos _ primary stars .\nthe diagrams are built in the ( v , v - j ) system of visual magnitude and optical - to - infrared color , a system most useful for displaying the cool end of the main sequence and perhaps the most appropriate for our sample of secondary stars , which is dominated by cool red dwarfs .\nsecondaries found in the immediate vicinity of bright _ hipparcos _ stars often suffer from large measurement errors in their optical v magnitudes , which are derived from poss plate measurements .\nfor that reason , we separate the secondaries into two distinct groups , those with angular separations @xmath123 and those with @xmath124 .\nthe color - magnitude test is expected to fail for many of the closer pairs because of possible large errors in their estimated v magnitude .\nfortunately , pairs with small separations have a very low probability of being chance alignments , so it is safe to assume that they are physically associated , in any case .\nfigure 5 shows color - magnitude diagrams for the primaries ( top ) , the close @xmath123 secondaries ( middle ) , and the wide @xmath124 secondaries ( bottom ) .\nthe figure also plots in diagrams in two separate columns , comparing the pairs with _ hipparcos _ secondaries from  2 ( left ) with the pairs with non- _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( right ) .\noverall , we find that the majority of the secondaries fall close to either the main sequence or the white dwarf cooling sequence .\na pair of dotted lines delimitates a the region where stars are within 1.5 mag of the standard main sequence ( upper right in the diagram ) as determined from a fit of nearby stars with known trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .\na second pair of lines identifies the region within 1.5 mag of the standard white dwarf sequence based on the distribution of nearby white dwarfs with known trigonometric parallaxes ( lpine 2006 , in preparation ) .\nsecondaries with @xmath123 are found to exhibit a significantly larger dispersion about the main sequence than the pairs with @xmath124 . for the pairs with _\nsecondaries , the @xmath124 companions have a mean position of only 0.01 mag above the main sequence with a @xmath125 dispersion of 0.39 mag ; the only clear outlier ( at m@xmath126=1.27 , v - j=1.97 ) is the star hip 64522 = hd 115061 , a known giant star .\nthe _ hipparcos _\nsecondaries with @xmath123 , one the other hand , have many more clear outliers .\nif we disregard all the secondaries that are off the main sequence by more than 3 magnitudes , we still find that the companions lie on average 0.42 mag above the main sequence , with a dispersion of 0.95 mag .\nthis larger dispersion suggests that the magnitudes and colors of the closer companions carry large uncertainties , and the 0.42 mag offset even suggests possible systematic errors .\nlikewise the magnitudes and colors of the non-_hipparcos _ secondaries are clearly more scattered around the main sequence for companions with ( @xmath123 ) .\neven if we exclude the 3-magnitude outliers , we find that the close secondaries are on average 0.11 mag below the main sequence with a dispersion of 1.33 mag .\ncompanions with @xmath124 have a mean offset of 0.05 mag with a significantly smaller dispersion of only 0.45 mag .\nwe conclude that the colors and magnitudes of the short separation pairs ( @xmath123 ) are not reliable enough to be useful for a photometric distance comparison . for the large separation pairs ( @xmath124 ) , however , the colors and magnitudes are accurate enough to use the photometric distance of the secondary as a confirmation that the two components are physically related .\nit is clear from fig.5 that several of the wide secondaries do fail the test .\nthe lower - right panel shows several secondaries that are outliers of both the red dwarf and white dwarf sequences .\nwe identify a total of 20 pairs with mismatched companions ; these are listed separately in table 3 .\nnine of these uncertain secondaries are found lying @xmath127 magnitudes above the standard main sequence .\none possible explanation is that these secondaries are actually foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with background _\nhipparcos _ stars .\nanother possibility is that these secondaries are actually unresolved double stars ( in which case these would really be triple systems ) .\nan unresolved pair of stars with components of similar color and absolute magnitude will appear 0.75 mag brighter than a single star of the same type . reducing the absolute magnitudes of those `` overluminous '' secondaries by 0.75 mag , to account for unresolved companions , would bring them back within range of the standard main sequence .\nthe binary status of these stars should be verified through either high angular resolution imaging @xcite or radial velocity monitoring @xcite .\nthe remaining 11 `` uncertain '' companions are found lying between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence .\nthe simplest interpretation is that these stars are background red dwarfs in chance alignments with foreground _ hipparcos _ stars .\nthey could also be foreground white dwarfs in chance alignments with background _\nhipparcos _ stars .\nanother possibility , however , is that these secondaries are red subdwarfs .\nred subdwarfs are the metal - poor counterparts of the main sequence red dwarfs ; in the color magnitude diagram , the subdwarf sequence is found to the left ( blueward ) of the main sequence @xcite .\nthis is because lower metallicities result in lower atomic and molecular opacities in the optical bands , shifting the spectral energy distribution to the blue @xcite . in the ( m@xmath126,v - j ) color - magnitude diagram , red subdwarfs\nare expected to fall between the main sequence and the white dwarf sequence .\na simple kinematic test can be applied to check if a star is a good subdwarf candidate . in the solar neighborhood ,\nsubdwarfs generally exist as high - velocity stars .\nthis is because local metal - poor stars are usually members of the galactic halo or thick disk @xcite . in figure 6\n, we plot the projected , transverse velocities v@xmath128 of our cpm doubles , against their angular separation @xmath50 .\nthe top panel shows pairs which have secondaries that consistently fall on the main sequence when placed at the primary s distance ( see fig.5 ) .\nthe bottom panel shows the uncertain pairs , including those for which the secondaries are suspected to be subdwarfs ( using the same symbols as in fig.5 ) .\nwe find only one pair with a transverse velocity which clearly associate it with the halo population .\nthis is the pair whose primary is the star hip 35756 ( g 89 - 14 ) a known spectroscopic double @xcite .\nalthough its parallax is fairly uncertain ( @xmath129 ) , g 89 - 14 has long been known to be a metal - poor subdwarf , with log(fe / h)@xmath130 @xcite .\nthe relatively small angular separation to the secondary ( @xmath131 ) further argues in favor of this pair being a physical double ( or rather triple , since the _ hipparcos _ primary is itself an unresolved double ) .\nindeed , this cpm multiple had already been identified as a physical pair by @xcite , in their search for wide binaries among known metal poor stars .\nthe primaries of the remaining 10 objects , on the other hand , have kinematics more consistent with the disk population , which makes the alleged secondaries unlikely to be subdwarfs .\nfor the 4 pairs with the largest separations @xmath132 , a good case can be made that they are most likely to be chance alignments .\nthe situation is not so clear for the 6 other pairs , which have @xmath133 : the proximity of the components argues against simple chance alignments .\neither these stars have large errors in their magnitudes , or they are most likely to be subdwarfs .\nthe subdwarf status of the alleged cpm companions should be checked more directly through spectroscopic measurements .\nmetallicity effects can be diagnosed in optical spectra from the ratio of the tio and cah bandstrengths @xcite .\nif both the primary and secondary have spectra consistent with a low metallicity object ( i.e. if they are both spectroscopic subdwarfs ) then they are most likely to be actual physical doubles .\nif on the other hand , the stars are both found to be regular dwarfs , then the pair must be a chance alignment . if one component is found to be a dwarf and the other a subdwarf\n, then it would also strongly suggest that the pair is a chance alignment , since one would expect cpm doubles to have similar chemical compositions .\ngiven the angular separation limits of our search algorithm , we do expect to be overlooking genuine wide binaries with very large angular separations .\nthe range of our search actually depends on the proper motion of the pair .\nfor instance , pairs with a mean proper motion @xmath134 yr@xmath1 and proper motion differences @xmath135 mas yr@xmath1 will not make it into the sample if @xmath136 .\nproper motions in the lspm - north catalog have a mean error of 8 mas @xmath1 , which at first guess suggests typical proper motion differences @xmath13711.3 mas @xmath1 , for cpm binaries .\nthe actual errors in @xmath52 are probably somewhat smaller , because part of the 8 mas @xmath1 proper motion errors in the lspm - north are due to systematic errors , which affect both stars in a cpm pair equally , and these systematic errors subtract out in @xmath52 . in any case\n, we conservatively adopt 11.3 mas @xmath1 as the mean error in @xmath52 , and place a 3-@xmath97 limit at @xmath138 mas yr@xmath1 .\nsince this is larger than our adopted detection limits at large separations , we conclude that it is likely that at least a few genuine pairs have been rejected by our search algorithm .\na look at fig.4 ( bottom panel ) shows a handful of pairs with angular separations @xmath139 and relative proper motions @xmath140 mas yr@xmath1 ( dashed line ) that were not selected by our algorithm .\nwhile these pairs still have a fairly high probability of being chance alignments , we can not exclude the possibility that a significant fraction of them are wide binaries .\nassuming that all the pairs with @xmath140mas yr@xmath1 are actually wide binaries , we calculate that these would represent only @xmath141 of the total pairs found .\nhence we are confident that our census must be at least @xmath142 complete up to @xmath143 . beyond that limit\n, the completeness of our survey probably falls as the angular separation increases .\ntable 3 gives a list of the 347 doubles , 10 triples , and 1 quadruple ultimately selected as wide binary systems .\nthe table give the lspm catalog number of the primary ( column 1 ) , the _ hipparcos _ catalog number of the primary ( 2 ) , its right ascension ( 3 ) , its declination ( 4 ) , its proper motion in the direction or r.a . and in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 5 ) , its proper motion in the direction of decl .\nalso in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 6 ) , its apparent @xmath117 magnitude ( 7 ) , its @xmath118 optical - to - infrared color ( 8) , its parallax in milliarcseconds ( 9 ) , the estimated parallax error in milliarcseconds ( 10 ) , the angular separation between the primary and secondary in @xmath42 ( 11 ) , all followed by the lspm catalog number of the secondary ( 12 ) , its right ascension ( 13 ) , its declination ( 14 ) , its proper motion in the direction or r.a . and in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 15 ) , its proper motion in the direction of decl . in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 16 ) , its apparent @xmath117 magnitude ( 17 ) , and its @xmath118 optical - to - infrared color ( 18 ) . as in table 1 , the triple systems are represented by two separate ( out of the possible three ) pairings .\nthe quadruple system in represented by 3 pairings .\na flag in column 20 identifies the triples and quadruple .    of the 400 pairings with non-_hipparcos _ secondaries ,\n208 are listed in gc04 ; these stars are indicated with a `` gc '' flag in table 3 .\nsome 134 of these were also listed in luyten s lds catalog .\nwe find 26 additional pairs not listed in gc04 , but listed in the lds catalog .\nthe remaining 130 pairs are new wide binary systems , reported here for the first time .\nwe note that out of the 156 pairs that are not listed in gc04 , 145 are pairs for which the primary and/or secondary was not listed in the rnltt catalog , which explains their absence from the gc04 list . for\nthe 22 systems whose primaries and secondaries are both listed in the rnltt as well as in the lspm - north , we found one ( with hip 102040 as the primary ) that has a proper motion difference @xmath144 mas yr@xmath1 in the rnltt , which places it just outside of the selection range used in gc04 ( @xmath145 ) .\nthe lspm - north proper motions yield a @xmath146 mas yr@xmath1 for that pair , well inside our own detection range .\nthe other 21 pairs , however , have @xmath147 and @xmath52 within the selection limits of gc04 , and it remains unclear why they were not included in their list .    within the limits of our search area ( the northern sky ) , we found only 4 pairs in the gc04 list that were not picked up by our search algorithm .\nthese 4 pairs have hip 45488 , hip 51547 , hip 53008 , and hip 64386 as their primary stars .\ntheir alleged cpm companions are relatively distant , with angular separations of 444@xmath42 , 142@xmath42 , 178@xmath42 , and 453@xmath42 respectively .\nwe found differences in proper motion of 21 @xmath148 , 24 @xmath148 , 16 @xmath148 , and 79 @xmath148 , respectively , for these pairs ; these fairly large differences , and the large angular separations , explains why fell outside our selection zone .\nit is possible that some of these pairs , and other pairs rejected in our algorithm , might be genuine physical doubles , particularly those that just barely fell off the selection limit .\noverall , we find that our own census recovers essentially all the gc04 pairs , and adds a significant number of new objects .\nthe improvement clearly comes from the use of the more complete lspm - north catalog .\ngiven the very high estimated completeness of the lspm - north , we are confident that we have now identified virtually _ all _ existing companions of _ hipparcos _ stars within a relatively large range of angular separations , and down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 .\nwe have determined in  4.3 that our census is statistically ( @xmath38 ) complete up to angular separations @xmath143 .\nthe survey also has a limit at small angular separations .\nthe large apparent magnitude of the _ hipparcos _ primaries and their deep saturation on photographic survey plates hampers our detection of companions with small angular separations . since the lspm - north is based on analyses of digitized sky survey scans of poss - i and poss - ii , this is a severe limitation because _ hipparcos _ stars are deeply saturated on poss - i plates . for pairs where only one component is a _\nstar , we should be able to see companions only for angular separations @xmath149 .\nsome companions in the lspm - north have been resolved from 2mass images , but this is possible only for relatively bright companions , in any case much brighter than the @xmath39 catalog limit .\npairs for which both components are _ hipparcos _ stars are not limited in the same way , because the lspm - north uses the _ hipparcos _ catalog itself as input for the brighter stars .\nall pairs with @xmath150 should be resolved in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .\nwe can thus use the statistically complete distribution in angular separations of the _ hipparcos_+ _ hipparcos _ pairs to estimate the incompleteness of our census for pairs with faint secondaries .\nfigure 7 plots the projected orbital separations @xmath151 of the pairs as a function of their distance @xmath152 ( estimated from the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xmath153 ) .\nnote that our systems tend to be relatively nearby , with most of the pairs lying at distances 20 - 100 parsec .\nthe fact that fewer pairs are detected at larger distances is the result of proper motion selection effects . because of the lower limit @xmath0 yr@xmath1 of the lspm - north , stars with low transverse velocities\nare increasingly left out of the sample at larger distances @xcite .\nthe number of detected systems hence reaches a maximum around @xmath154 pc .\nwhat is also apparent in fig.7 is the dominance of pairs @xmath155 in the hip+hip systems .\nin contrast , pairs for which only the primary is a _ hipparcos _\nstar , are mostly found with @xmath156 .\nour census of systems with faint secondaries is thus clearly undersampled in pairs with @xmath155 .\nthis is largely consistent with our prediction that secondaries with small angular separations would be lost in the glare of their bright primaries .\nwe conclude that our census is thus statistically complete only over the range @xmath157 .    while our census spans only 1.3 orders of magnitude in @xmath50 , we are actually sensitive to a larger range of projected orbital separations @xmath158 because our sample covers systems over a relatively large range of distances .\nsince our pairs are found in a range of distances 15 pc@xmath159100 pc , our effective sampling range for wide companions is between 300 au and 30,000 au .\nit is worth noting that this extends beyond the canonical upper limit @xmath160 pc (= 20,000 au ) for wide binary systems @xcite .\nour sample actually suggests the existence of wide binaries with @xmath161 pc . our widest binary system is the pair composed of hip 64157 and the faint high proper motion star lspm j1308 + 3332 (= nltt 33016 ) , which have an angular separation @xmath162 and are located at a distance @xmath163 pc , which yields an orbital separation @xmath164au .\nnote that the pair has a relatively large transverse velocity @xmath165 km s@xmath1 , which rules out the alternate interpretation that the two star are co - moving members of a young association .\nfigure 8 shows the distribution in absolute magnitudes @xmath166 and distances of the cpm secondaries , for pairs with separations @xmath167 . in this range of angular separations\n, our census should be nearly complete down to the limiting magnitude of the lspm - north catalog i.e. @xmath39 .\nwe show distinct plots for _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( top ) and non-_hipparcos _ secondaries ( bottom ) .\nthe secondaries are clearly dominated by stars with @xmath168 , in other words by m dwarfs .\nsince most of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are g dwarfs , with @xmath169 , it is clear that there is no general tendency for the secondaries to be of similar masses as their primaries .\nthe secondaries , in fact , look like they could have been drawn from the field population of single stars ( see however  5.3 below ) .    the magnitude limit of the lspm - north catalog yields a limiting absolute magnitude which is dependent on the distance of the pair .\nthe majority of our pairs are relatively close ; if we restrict our sample to objects within @xmath7 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be complete down to @xmath170 .\nthis happens to be just beyond the peak in the luminosity function of low - mass red dwarfs @xcite .\nassuming the luminosity function of the secondaries to be roughly similar to that of field stars , then our census should be missing only a relatively small fraction of the hydrogen - burning secondaries . in any case\n, our detection of several very nearby ( @xmath171 pc ) secondaries with @xmath172 suggests that several very - low mass companions remain to be discovered at larger distances . to be detected\n, these will require catalogs of high proper motion stars with significantly fainter magnitude limits .\na close examination of the distribution in the absolute magnitude of the cpm secondaries shows a deficit of low - luminosity objects ( @xmath173 ) compared with the field luminosity function .\nfigure 9 shows the @xmath166 distribution for the primaries and secondaries in our sample .\nwe use a monte - carlo simulation to predict the magnitude distribution of the secondaries , using the assumption that both components are drawn independently from the field luminosity function .\nwe adopt the luminosity function of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood estimated by @xcite ; the additional contribution of the white dwarfs can be neglected , since they account for less than 5% of the secondaries . as shown in fig.9 ,\nthe distribution observed for the secondaries is significantly different from the predicted one .\nif we adjust the simulations to match the numbers of bright ( @xmath174 ) secondaries , we find only @xmath175 of objects in the @xmath176 range predicted by the model .\nsince our census is demonstrably complete at @xmath7 pc down to @xmath170 , the difference is significant , and rules out the idea that the luminosity function of the secondaries is comparable to the field luminosity function .    since the absolute magnitude of main sequence stars\nis correlated with mass , the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as cpm secondaries than they are in the field population .\none simple interpretation is that the formation mechanisms for wide binaries are biased against secondaries of very low mass or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries .\nanother possible interpretation is that wide binaries are formed initially with both components drawn from the same mass function , but that gravitational interactions with the environment disrupt a number of systems over time , in events that favor the disruption of systems with low - mass secondaries .\nin fact , if we assume that both components in wide binaries initially follow the field luminosity function , then the ratio between the observed ( or `` current '' ) and predicted ( `` initial '' ) luminosity function ( fig.9 ) shows a trend that suggest that the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time .\nshould this interpretation be correct , then one should expect to find very few faint companions of _ hipparcos _ stars with absolute magnitudes @xmath177 . this would imply that our sample is already nearly complete for wide hydrogen - burning companions , and that very few fainter companions should be found .      from our statistically complete sample of cpm pairs with _\nprimaries , we can now estimate the multiplicity fraction of wide binary systems in the solar neighborhood .\nwe have determined that our northern - sky census was statistically complete for systems within 100 pc and proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , and for cpm companions with luminosities @xmath178 .\nwe estimate the multiplicity fraction by comparing the number of wide binaries found in our survey to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars in the same range of position , distance , and proper motion . a search of the _ hipparcos _ catalog finds a total of 3,041 stars north of the celestial equator with proper motion @xmath0 , parallaxes @xmath179 mas , and a parallax accuracy of better than 10% .\nwe calculate the number density of wide binaries as a function of the logarithm of the _ projected _ , orbital separation between the pairs @xmath180 , with @xmath158 expressed in au .\nnote that @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the actual orbital separation between the components and @xmath183 the orbital inclination .\nwhile @xmath182 is the physically meaningful quantity , we only have @xmath158 as the observable .\nwe separate our sample into bins of 0.2 in @xmath180 .\nwe calculate the multiplicity fraction for each bin by taking the ratio of wide binaries found in that bin to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars which satisfy the distance detection limits for that bin , based on a range of angular separations @xmath184 . for instance , the @xmath185 bin can only comprise systems with distances between 1.4pc and 62.9pc ( see fig 7 ) . the resulting wide binary frequency distribution is shown in figure 10 .\nour results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with separations @xmath8 au .\nmore specifically , this conclusion is valid for systems in which the primary is a typical , nearby _ hipparcos _ star , i.e. the primary is a g dwarf with absolute magnitude @xmath187 .\nwe try to fit the observed distribution of orbital separation with two different models previously used in the literature .\nfirst we try a model of the form used by @xcite , which modelizes the distribution over the logarithm of orbital periods @xmath188 with a gaussian : @xmath189 with @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and where @xmath193 is the total multiplicity fraction , i.e. @xmath194 . for the systems considered in this paper , in which the primary stars are mostly solar - type objects with masses @xmath195 , we calculate the following statistical relationship between the period @xmath15 and projected separation @xmath158 : @xmath196 where @xmath15 is expressed in years and @xmath158 in au .\nwe then have : @xmath197 our attempt to fit this form to the observed distribution of projected separations is shown in fig.10 ( model a ) .\nour best fit does not reproduce well the form of the distribution , and predicts more objects at small separations than are actually observed .\nin fact , out best fit model suggests a total multiplicity fraction @xmath198 , which is much larger than the total binary fraction estimated by @xcite . we take this as evidence that this particular form is inadequate in the range of orbital separations under consideration .\nour second attempt to modelize the distribution of orbital separations uses a power - law of the form : @xmath199 given that the mean projected separation in a sample of systems with random orbital plane orientations is @xmath200 , then statistically the distribution in projected separations @xmath158 also follows : @xmath201 if we plot the distribution along @xmath180 we have : @xmath202 the specific form of the equation for which @xmath36 is the well - known _ pik s law _ , and yields a distribution which is uniform in @xmath180 .\nwe find that our data can be consistently modeled with two distinct power - law distributions over two separate ranges of orbital separations ( fig.10 , model b ) . at small projected separations ,\nour data are consistent with _ pik s law _ , but only up to a separation @xmath203 au . beyond that limit\n, the distribution shows a sudden break , and can best be fitted with a @xmath204 power index .\nthe latter is consistent with the trends observed by @xcite for both their disk and halo samples .\nthe flattening of the distribution below @xmath203 au , which is also hinted at in the cg04 data , is not much of a surprise since the @xmath204 power law can not possibly extend to much smaller orbital separations or the multiplicity fraction might take unphysical values .\nan extrapolation to @xmath205 ( @xmath206au ) , for instance , would yield a total binary fraction larger than 1 .\nperhaps the more significant result is not the flattening of the @xmath204 power law distribution toward small angular separations , but rather the observed break in _ pik s law _ at large angular separations .\nif one believes that star formation processes initially yield a distribution of wide binary systems consistent with _\npik s law _ , then our data reveals the range of maximum extension of the law .\n_ pik s law\n_ then probably breaks down because of the disruptive effects of the environment in which the stars are born .\ndisruption would most likely occur through interactions with neighboring stellar systems , perhaps in the very same cluster in which these systems are born .\na much larger census of wide binary systems , which would yield a more detailed distribution of orbital separations , might shed more light on the processes at work in hampering the formation of extremely wide pairs .\nwe have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of the lspm - north , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations @xmath207 .\nsince the lspm - north is statistically complete in high proper motion stars down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 , our census of wide binaries is complete to a distance of 100 pc for companions with absolute magnitude @xmath178 .\nthis high completeness yields the most thorough search for wide companions to _ hipparcos _ stars conducted to date .\nwe find that the observed luminosity function of the faint secondaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population .\nmost of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are f - g dwarfs with absolute magnitudes around @xmath208 .\nthe secondaries , on the other hand , are dominated by fainter k - m dwarfs , with a range of absolute magnitude peaking at @xmath209 .\nwhile fainter , lower - mass companions clearly dominate over companions of similar masses and luminosities , one finds only half the number of faint secondaries as one would expect if both primaries and secondaries were drawn from the field luminosity function .\nthe bias against low - mass secondaries also appears to get more severe at lower secondary masses .\nwe further observe a distribution in the projected separations @xmath158 which is consistent with _\npik s law _\n( @xmath210 ds ) for systems with orbital separations up to @xmath211 au . beyond that range , the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a power law @xmath212 ds .\nour data thus provides clear evidence for a break in _\npik s law _ at large angular separations , and we suggest that the break occurs as interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they are formed .\nmeasurements of the distribution of orbital separations remain relatively crude .\na more detailed analysis of the binary frequency , which holds the promise to provide stringent constraints on multiple star formation models , will require much larger samples of cpm pairs .\nat this time , we plan to first expand our census to the southern hemisphere using the upcoming lspm - south catalog ( lpine & shara , in preparation ) which will be the analog of the lspm - north for the southern declinations .\nthis will double our census cpm pairs .\nthe census of wide binaries should also be expanded further by extending the search to smaller proper motion regimes .\nsuch a survey of pairs of stars with low proper motions has recently been demonstrated by @xcite , who identified 705 wide binaries among stars with proper motions ( @xmath213 yr@xmath1 ) based on an analysis of the ucac2 astrometric catalog .\nthe _ hipparcos _\ncatalog has 16,753 objects within 100 parsecs and parallaxes better than @xmath214 .\nhowever , only 6,202 of these have proper motions @xmath215 , the current range of our proper motion survey\n. however , 13,368 of these nearby _ hipparcos _ stars have proper motion @xmath216 , so a catalog of stars with @xmath216 would potentially double the census of wide binaries .\nthe census could further be expanded by investigating _ hipparcos\n_ stars at larger recorded distances , adding up to 10,000 targets in the 100 - 200pc range\n.    it would also be desirable to break the low angular separation limit @xmath217 of the photographic plate - based surveys .\na look at fig.7 is highly suggestive of the existence of significant numbers of faint companions with small angular separations .\nwith ccd imaging and adaptive optics systems , it should be possible to perform a complete census of cpm companions of _ hipparcos _ stars down to angular separations of a fraction of an arcsecond\n. this would be particularly useful in extending the census to pairs with smaller orbital separations ( s@xmath218 au ) and verify whether this regime can be consistently modeled with _ pik s\nlaw_.                                                                        luyten , w. j. 1987 , the lds catalogue : double stars with common proper motion , publ .\nminnesota iii , part 3 , 35 ;

{"id": "dev_longform_130", "text": "coupling a two - level system ( tls ) to a harmonic oscillator has attracted a lot of attention in various fields of physics .\nexamples are two - level quantum dots in photonic crystal nanocavities @xcite , a quantum dot exciton in a microcavity @xcite , or single atoms with a large dipole moment interacting with photons in a microwave cavity @xcite . within the framework of quantum computation two prominent solid - state realizations of a qubit - oscillator system\nare found : a cooper - pair box @xcite coupled to a transmission line resonator @xcite and the josephson flux qubit @xcite read - out by a dc - squid@xcite .\nthe cooper - pair box setup has been used to perform non - demolition measurements or to transfer information between qubits via the transmission line resonator @xcite . in the second experimental realization\nthe flux qubit is usually read - out via a damped dc - squid , which acts as a linear or nonlinear oscillator .\na non - demolition read - out procedure , based on the measurement of the josephson inductance , is given by lupacu et al .\n+ at present the effort to exploit the nonlinearity of a qubit read - out device , for example , a dc - squid or a josephson bifurcation amplifier ( jba ) @xcite , is growing , as nonlinear effects lead to advantages in various measurement schemes and to new physical observations .\nfor example , the qubit read - out can be optimized by using the squid in the nonlinear regime as a bifurcation amplifier leading to fast read - out with high fidelity @xcite .\nsecond , the bifurcation allows for a higher sensitivity when determining the qubit states and , due to the nonlinear josephson inductance , a high quality factor for the resonance is achieved @xcite .\nhowever , the nonlinear regime also provides new channels of relaxation @xcite .\nmoreover there are recent experiments embedding a micromechanical resonator in a nonlinear dc - squid , which is strongly damped to avoid bistability , to acquire cooling and squeezing of the resonator modes and to achieve quantum - limited position detection @xcite .\nsuch a composed system can then also be coupled to a qubit . besides these examples\na squid which is embedded into a cavity @xcite can be used as a bifurcation amplifier in its nonlinear regime .\n+ all these approaches rely in principle on treating the squid as a classical nonlinear system . to our knowledge\nthere has been to date no experimental realization of a squid in the nonlinear quantum regime .\n+ from the theoretical point of view nonlinear quantum oscillators have been predominantly studied within the context of the quantum duffing oscillator model @xcite , where the oscillator is subject to an external ac driving force .\nstrikingly , the response of the duffing oscillator displays antiresonant dips and resonant peaks depending on the frequency of the driving field @xcite .\nthe antiresonances persist in the presence of a weak ohmic bath ; for high damping the nonlinear response of the oscillator resembles the one of a linear oscillator at a shifted frequency @xcite .\n+ despite the numerous theoretical works on coupled qubit - linear oscillator systems @xcite the case of a tls - josephson bifurcation amplifier system has been addressed only very recently by nakano et al .\nhere we study the squid as a nonlinear , undriven oscillator acting as a read - out device for a qubit .\nwe consider weak nonlinearities such that the corresponding linear system can be retained at any step of our calculation . with the help of van vleck perturbation theory in the tls - oscillator coupling @xmath0\nwe determine the eigenstates and spectrum of the coupled system and the corresponding dynamics in analytic form .\nthus we can quantitatively characterize the influence of the coupling @xmath0 and of the nonlinearity on the dynamics of the composed system .\nthe overall effects of the nonlinearity are the following : ( i ) a shift of the transition frequencies to higher values compared to the linear case ; ( ii ) the amplitudes associated to the transition frequencies are modified .\nin particular the vacuum rabi splitting is decreased by the interplay of coupling and nonlinearity . to account for dissipative effects\nwe add a weak ohmic environment .\nthen the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the composed system can be described in terms of a set of coupled differential equations for its matrix elements in the energy basis ( bloch - redfield equations ) .\nwe discuss a partial secular approximation ( psa ) to those equations as well as two more stringent approximations , the full secular approximation in the low temperature approximation ( lta ) and the smallest eigenvalue approximation ( sea ) accounting for the long time dynamics .\nall these three approximation schemes allow for analytical solution of the dynamics of the tls , which we compare with predictions obtained by numerically solving the bloch - redfield equations .\nit turns out that the most accurate psa should be used when investigating strong nonlinearities .\nthe long - time approximation enables us nevertheless to extract the correct relaxation rate within the regime of validity of our perturbative approach .\nthe paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the model with the relevant dynamical quantities . in section [ secenspec ] the energy spectrum and the dynamics of the non - dissipative coupled system is investigated .\nsection [ env ] addresses the dissipative effects , while in section [ secres ] results are represented . in section\n[ conclusions ] conclusions are drawn .\nin this section we consider a tls coupled to a nonlinear oscillator , which itself is coupled to an ohmic bath .\nthis model mimics , e.g. , the situation of a flux qubit , made of three josephson junctions , which is coupled inductively to a damped dc - squid @xcite .\nthe qubit with its two logical states , the clockwise and counterclockwise currents , represents a two - level system . because the squid itself is coupled to an environment , it transfers environmental influences which lead to the dissipation in the qubit\n. hence the total hamiltonian reads : @xmath1 with @xmath2 describing the coupled tls - nonlinear oscillator system , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the coupling between the oscillator and bath and the bath hamiltonian , respectively . for later convenience\nwe write @xmath5 with coupling hamiltonian @xmath6 .\nfirst we consider the hamiltonian of the tls , @xmath7 represented in the localized basis @xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise currents , respectively , in the superconducting ring .\nthe @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are the corresponding pauli matrices .\nthe energy bias @xmath11 can be tuned for a superconducting flux qubit by application of an external flux @xmath12 and vanishes at the so - called degeneracy point @xcite . + for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the tunneling amplitude , the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 are eigenstates of the tls , while at the degeneracy point the eigenstates @xmath17 , @xmath18 are given by symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions , respectively , of the two logical states .\nin general the states @xmath16 and @xmath15 become in the energy basis : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .\nmoreover in this basis the tls hamiltonian is : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the pauli matrix in the energy basis and @xmath24 is the energy splitting .\nthe hamiltonian for the nonlinear oscillator is composed of a linear harmonic oscillator modified with a quartic term in the position operator , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the occupation number operator of the linear oscillator and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the corresponding annihilation and creation operators . in the following we restrict to the case of hard nonlinearities ,\ni.e. , @xmath29 . using time - independent perturbation theory we consider small nonlinearities @xmath30 and evaluate the eigenvalues @xmath31 and eigenfunctions @xmath32 of ( [ hno ] ) to lowest order in the nonlinearity , @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the eigenstate of the corresponding linear oscillator . the expansion coefficients for the @xmath36th state of the nonlinear oscillator\nare given by : @xmath37 we notice that two arbitrary eigenstates @xmath32 , @xmath38 are orthonormal up to first order in the nonlinearity .\n+ perturbation theory for a nonlinear oscillator has to be elaborated carefully .\ndue to the special form of the nonlinear term , proportional to @xmath39 the energy corrections acquire a strong level dependence : @xmath40 for the first , see eq .\n( [ enpert ] ) , and @xmath41 for the second order . depending on the actual level number\nthe second order can be as large as the first order for fixed nonlinearity . to avoid this\n, one has to choose the nonlinearity parameter @xmath42 such that the oscillator levels under consideration are well represented by the first order result . the error done by disregarding the @xmath43th order perturbation theory\nis estimated in the following by introducing @xmath44 for different nonlinearities ( see table [ table ] ) .\n.error estimation for different values of the nonlinearity for the six lowest levels.[table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking only first order perturbation theory into account , the error is determined by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the highest level under consideration .\nthe error made by using first order perturbation theory is in case of @xmath47 around @xmath48 for the @xmath49 level .\n+ finally we consider a coupling hamiltonian of the form : @xmath50 this kind of coupling arises due to the inductive coupling of the tls to the squid @xcite .\nfollowing caldeira and leggett @xcite , we model the environmental influences originating from the circuitry surrounding the qubit and the oscillator as a bath of harmonic oscillators being coupled bilinearly to the nonlinear oscillator .\nthus , the environment is described by @xmath51 and the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath52 the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for the @xmath55th bath oscillator , @xmath56 is its frequency , and @xmath57 gives the coupling strength .\nthe whole bath can be described by its spectral density , which we consider to be ohmic , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a dimensionless coupling strength .\nwe wish to describe the dynamics @xmath60 of the tls described by the population difference @xmath61 between the @xmath62 and @xmath63 states of the qubit .\nthe reduced density matrix of the tls , @xmath64 is found after tracing out the oscillator and bath degrees of freedom from the total density matrix @xmath65 .\nfor vanishing nonlinearities it is possible to map the problem described by the hamiltonian in equation ( [ htot ] ) onto a spin - boson model @xcite with an effective peaked spectral density depending on the coupling @xmath0 , the frequency @xmath66 , and the damping strength @xmath59 .\nthis mapping hence allows the evaluation of the population difference @xmath60 of the tls using standard approximations developed for the spin - boson model @xcite .\nthis mapping , however , does no longer hold true in the nonlinear oscillator case .\nhence in this work we consider the tls and the nonlinear oscillator as central quantum system and describe dissipative effects by solving the bloch - redfield master equations for the reduced density matrix @xmath67 of the qubit - no system . in a second step\nwe perform the trace over the no degrees of freedom to obtain the reduced dynamics of the tls .\nan expression for @xmath60 is then given in terms of diagonal and off - diagonal elements of @xmath68 in the @xmath2 hamiltonian s eigenbasis

are derived in the next section .\nin the following we derive the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the unperturbed tls - no hamiltonian @xmath2 using van vleck perturbation theory @xcite . this approach allows us to deal with spectra containing almost exactly degenerate levels organized in manifolds ( here doublets ) , as it is the case if the tls and nonlinear oscillator are close to resonance , @xmath73 , and the coupling @xmath0 is small compared to the energy separation of the manifolds .\nthe eigenstates of the uncoupled tls - no system hamiltonian @xmath74 are @xmath75 .\nthe associated energies are depicted by the dotted lines in figure [ enspec ] . at the resonance condition of the tls with two neighboring nonlinear oscillator levels , @xmath76 where @xmath36 denotes the lower oscillator level involved , the states @xmath77 and @xmath78 are exactly degenerate except for the ground state @xmath79 . for finite coupling the full hamiltonian\n@xmath2 acquires in the basis @xmath80 the form @xmath81    to find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath82 , we treat @xmath83 as a small perturbation , which is satisfied for @xmath84 . using van vleck perturbation theory\n@xcite we can construct an effective hamiltonian by applying an unitary transformation to @xmath82 , @xmath85 @xmath86 has the same eigenvalues as @xmath82 but does not involve matrix elements connecting states which are far away from degeneracy . consequently it is block - diagonal with all quasi - degenerate energy levels being in one common block . because the quasi - degenerate states form doublets , each block of @xmath87 is given by a @xmath88 matrix .\nthe latter can be diagonalized easily . to calculate @xmath89 and @xmath87\nwe write both as a power series up to first order in the nonlinearity @xmath42 and up to second order in the coupling @xmath0 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 . the upper index in the above equation denotes the actual order in @xmath0 . consequently in the following\nwe assume that @xmath92 . to calculate @xmath93 and @xmath94\nwe use both that @xmath95 acts only inside a manifold and that @xmath89 has no matrix elements within a manifold .\nthe general formulas are found e.g. in @xcite .\n+ the results for the effective hamiltonian and the transformation matrix are given in the appendix [ vleck ] .\nthe non - vanishing matrix elements of the

nonlinearity and in second order in the coupling the form :    @xmath102    for the states @xmath78 and @xmath103 .\nthe ground state @xmath104 is an eigenstate of @xmath86 with eigenenergy : @xmath105 due to the doublet structure the blocks of the effective hamiltonian are @xmath88 matrices and the corresponding eigenvectors are for @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .\nmoreover , @xmath110 in turn the eigenstates of the qubit - nonlinear oscillator system are obtained from the transformation @xmath111 finally , the eigenenergies are then @xmath112 these eigenergies are also eigenenergies of @xmath82 by construction and are depicted in figure [ enspec ] ( solid lines ) for the case of an unbiased tls , @xmath113 . at finite coupling the degeneracy is lifted and we observe avoided crossings ( solid lines in figure [ enspec ] ) . due to the coupling the resonance condition acquires a shift compared to ( [ rescond ] ) , the so - called bloch - siegert shift @xcite , @xmath114 the resonance corresponds to @xmath115 .\nwe notice that the effect of the nonlinearity onto the bloch - siegert shift is very weak , namely at least of order @xmath116 and negligible for the values of nonlinearity and coupling we considered in the following .\n+ at resonance , equation ( [ bss ] ) , the minimal splitting of the former degenerate gap is :

obtain for the population difference in ( [ ptqubitho ] ) @xmath121 where we introduced @xmath122 .\nwe observe from ( [ gl1 ] ) that the dynamics of the tls is determined by an infinite number of oscillation frequencies rather than showing a single rabi oscillation . to set the initial conditions we assume that the qubit starts in the state @xmath62 and\nthat the occupation numbers of the no

equation ( [ gl1 ] ) allows us to describe the non - dissipative dynamics in terms of the approximate eigenenergies and eigenstates ( [ gl8 ] ) and ( [ gl3 ] ) , which involve in this way all nonlinear oscillator states .\ntherefore the hilbert space under consideration is infinite . to calculate @xmath127 and @xmath128 we need to know the structure of a matrix element such as @xmath129 .\nthe @xmath130 are themselves linear combinations of the uncoupled states @xmath131 , see ( [ gl2 ] ) . because we calculated @xmath132 up to second order in the coupling hamiltonian @xmath6\n, we find that the oscillator index @xmath36 can at most change by four , see appendix [ vleck ] . for typical experiments on qubits\nthe temperature is restricted to the regime of @xmath133 . due to the exponential function in ( [ gl4 ] ) high levels of the no\nare only weakly populated and consequently we can truncate the infinite sum in equation ( [ gl4 ] ) for the matrix elements of the density matrix at initial time to @xmath134 .\nthis means that the lowest 12 @xmath135 states enter ( [ gl4 ] ) .\n+ after a close analysis we observe , by inserting ( [ gl4 ] ) into ( [ gl6 ] ) , that the coefficients @xmath127 with @xmath136 are of higher than second order in @xmath0 .\nthe same is valid for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .\nthus those terms do not occur in the calculation of @xmath60 .\nof the remaining contributions we observe that those with @xmath139 are either at least of order @xmath140 $ ] or of order @xmath141 $ ] or of order @xmath142 .\nthus we can also disregard contributions from @xmath143 for @xmath144 for the parameters chosen in the following , i.e. , in the considered low temperature regime it is enough to restrict to the five lowest eigenstates of @xmath82 .\ntherefore the number of possible oscillation frequencies @xmath145 is reduced to 10 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 .\n+ in the following we show the dynamics of an unbiased tls ( @xmath113 ) , which results in vanishing of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .\ntherefore we obtain : @xmath153 exemplarily we consider in the following the resonant case for the

 @xmath211    the off - diagonal elements are determined by @xmath212 which results with ( [ gl11 ] ) in @xmath213 the separation of the oscillatory motion of the dynamics from the relaxation one

relaxation and dephasing part of @xmath60 . while the fsa allows a simple form for the dephasing rates , @xmath288 , the psa one is much more involved . as in case of the sea\nthe smallest eigenvalue dominates the dephasing behavior .\nthe corresponding bloch - redfield tensors are found in appendix [ appdeph ] .\nin the following we compare the results for the dynamical quantity @xmath60 and its fourier transform , obtained by a numerical solution of ( [ gl13 ] ) , with the predictions of the approximations from section [ env ] .\nwe start by focusing on low temperatures @xmath289 and compare the results for all three approaches ( sea , lta , and psa ) to the numerical solution in figure [ comppexactpapprox2 ] .\nwe recognize that the dynamics and the corresponding fourier spectrum are well reproduced within the simple sea approach as well as in the two lta and psa treatments and determined by the superposition of two oscillations .\nthe best approximation is the psa . in the following we use the sea approach due to its simpler analytic form . + to determine the effects of the nonlinearity onto the qubit dynamics we compare @xmath60 and @xmath290 with the corresponding linear case in figure [ ffig1 ] .\nwe choose @xmath291 .\nboth in the nonlinear and in the corresponding linear case two oscillation frequencies are dominant . due to the bloch - siegert shift ,\nsee ( [ bss ] ) , in both cases @xmath291 is not the exact resonance condition .\nhowever , in the nonlinear case the nonlinearity partly compensates the bloch - siegert shift , which also influences the relative peak heights , as we argued in section [ hamiltonian ] .      to investigate the influence of temperature we show in figure [ ffig2 ] @xmath292 and the corresponding @xmath290 for the same parameters as in figure [ ffig1 ] , but at inverse temperature : @xmath293 . by increasing the temperature higher oscillator levels\nare populated and influence the dynamics of the qubit .\nwe calculated the corresponding equations for the long time dynamics within the sea .\nthe relaxation matrix @xmath294 for the rate @xmath295 was calculated inplementing higher levels , until @xmath296 .\n+ we plot for comparison also the linear oscillator case .\nwe observe again the overall shift of the resonance frequencies to higher values and that a new shoulder arises in the fourier spectrum .\nit corresponds to the transition frequency @xmath297 ( see also figure [ ft6 ] bottom ) .\nwe checked numerically that the structure of the fourier spectrum can be fully respresented by summation of the six contributions in @xmath60 with the frequencies @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 .\nthese six contributions arise due to the finite populations of the involved levels .\ntherefore the appearance of additional shoulders in the dynamics is a pure temperature effect , which is also seen in the corresponding linear case .\nthe frequency shift induced by the nonlinearity is much larger for the higher levels .\nthe effect of temperature is also reflected in the height of the dominating peaks , which is decreased for higher temperatures . the temperature can not influence which peak is dominant .\nthis means by comparing figure [ ffig1 ] with figure [ ffig2 ] that in both figures in the nonlinear case the peak corresponding to @xmath158 dominates over the one corresponding @xmath159 .\n+ the use of a nonlinear oscillator instead of a linear one has advantages which rely in the fact that the energy spectrum of the nonlinear oscillator is not equidistant . supposing that the tls frequency @xmath301 can be tuned , it is in case of the nonlinear oscillator possible to have the tls in resonance with exactly one and only one nonlinear oscillator state transition .\nall other transitions are then off resonance / detuned .\nfor the linear oscillator in resonance with the tls the number of possible transitions is in principle infinite .\ntherefore we determine in the following the dynamics of the qubit by putting the qubit in resonance with the nonlinear oscillator transition @xmath302 , see figure [ ffig3 ] .\nwe read off from figure [ ffig3 ] that the detuning compared to figure [ ffig2 ] results in the enhancement of the @xmath159-peak , whereas the other dominating peak is shrinked .\nthis is due to the different resonance conditions leading to opposite weights of the peaks for the nonlinear case in figure [ ffig3 ] compared to figure [ ffig2 ] .\nhowever a peak corresponding to higher transitions is not seen .\nthe reason for this is the small population of the higher oscillator levels involved .\nto conclude , we determined the dynamics of a tls which is coupled via a nonlinear oscillator to an environment described by an ohmic spectral density .\nwe restricted ourselves to the regime of weak nonlinearity , weak damping and moderate coupling of oscillator and tls . to diagonalize the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator hamiltonian we used van vleck perturbation theory , hence avoiding the use of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . within the rwa and for vanishing nonlinearity\nour model would reduce to the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian . in section [ hamiltonian ] , an analytical expression for the non - dissipative dynamics\nis given , which accounts for the infinite hilbert space of the composed system .\nthe influence of the nonlinearity onto the qubit dynamics is determined and compared to the linear case .    at low temperatures @xmath303\nthis infinite hilbert space can be truncated such that the transition processes between the ground state and the two first excited energy levels of the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator system dominate the dynamics . as in the linear case\nthis yields a pronounced vacuum rabi splitting .\n+ to investigate the influence of the bath we solved the bloch - redfield markovian master equation for the density - matrix of the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator system numerically . for an analytical treatment we considered three kinds of approximations : first a full secular approximation including a low temperature approximation , where all fast oscillating terms are neglected .\nsecond an ansatz for the long - time dynamics allows a general expression for the relaxation and dephasing rates of the qubit .\nthe third approximation was a partial secular approximation reproducing almost perfectly the exact numerical solution .\na comparison of these three analytical approaches showed good agreement with the numerical solution .\nfinally , we investigated the effect of the non - equidistant energy spectrum of the nonlinear oscillator on the tls dynamics . to do so , we allowed higher temperatures to populate higher levels and moreover we concentrated on the actual transition of the nonlinear oscillator from @xmath302 .\nwe observed the rise of additional shoulders in the fourier spectrum and showed that the shift in the transition frequencies is much larger if higher oscillator levels are involved .\nwe acknowledge support by the dfg under the funding programs grk 638 , sfb 631 .\nin our

{"id": "dev_longform_145", "text": "when constructing symplectic manifolds it is natural to wonder whether topological techniques using handles can be made to work symplectically .\nweinstein  @xcite and eliashberg  @xcite have shown how to do this in certain cases ; here we present two new symplectic `` handle - by - handle '' constructions in dimension four .    in such constructions it is desirable to retain control of the symplectic form near the boundary ; one form of control is the following : given a symplectic manifold @xmath3 we say that @xmath4 is _ convex _\n( respectively _ concave _ ) if there exists a vector field @xmath5 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath4 , satisfying the equation @xmath6 ( in other words , @xmath5 is a symplectic dilation ) and pointing _ out of _\n( respectively _ into _ ) @xmath7 .\nthis induces a contact form @xmath8 and a contact structure @xmath9 on @xmath4 .\nweinstein and eliashberg show that , if @xmath3 is a symplectic @xmath10-manifold with @xmath4 convex , then one can attach @xmath11-handles to @xmath7 , for @xmath12 , and extend @xmath13 across the handles so that the new boundary is again convex .\nconditions are imposed on the attaching spheres in relation to the contact structure @xmath14 on @xmath4 and in particular , in dimension four , @xmath0-handles must be attached along _ legendrian _ knots ( knots tangent to @xmath14 ) . in this paper\nwe show how to symplectically attach @xmath0-handles along _ transverse _ knots ( transverse to @xmath14 ) in the convex boundary of a symplectic @xmath1-manifold so that the new boundary becomes _\nconcave_. along the way , we see boundaries which are partially convex and partially concave , so we develop a careful theory for such boundaries .    for a weaker form of control ,\nwe say that @xmath4 is _ weakly convex _\nif @xmath4 supports a positive contact structure @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is nondegenerate ; convexity implies weak convexity . in this paper\nwe also show how to symplectically attach @xmath0-handles along transverse knots in the convex boundary of a symplectic @xmath1-manifold so that the new boundary becomes weakly convex .\nwe first present the statements of two theorems followed by the definitions needed to understand the statements .\nlet @xmath3 be a compact symplectic @xmath1-manifold , suppose that @xmath4 is convex with induced contact structure @xmath14 and let @xmath16 be a transverse link in @xmath17 with a chosen framing @xmath18 .\n[ t : weakcvx ] if @xmath16 is _ fat with respect to @xmath18 _\n( a condition which holds for negative enough framings ) , then there exists a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath19 containing @xmath3 , obtained by _ enlarging _\n@xmath3 in a neighborhood of @xmath16 and then attaching @xmath0-handles along @xmath16 with framing @xmath18 , such that @xmath20 is weakly convex .\n[ t : cvx2ccv ] if @xmath16 is _ nicely fibered _ and if @xmath18 is _ positive with respect to the fibration _\n( a condition which holds for positive enough framings ) , then there exists a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath19 containing @xmath3 , obtained by _ enlarging _\n@xmath3 and then attaching @xmath0-handles along @xmath16 with framing @xmath18 , such that @xmath20 is concave .\n( for both theorems , more precise statements will be made later about the resulting contact structures on @xmath20 . )\nwe will now define `` fat with respect to a framing '' , `` nicely fibered '' and `` positive with respect to a fibration '' and we will say what we mean by `` enlarging @xmath3 '' .\nfirst we establish orientation conventions : in this paper all manifolds are assumed to be oriented , and all symplectic forms are assumed to be compatible with the given orientations . a vector field @xmath5 in a manifold @xmath7 transverse to a codimension\none submanifold @xmath21 is _ positively _ transverse if @xmath22 followed by an oriented basis for @xmath23 is an oriented basis for @xmath24 .\nboundaries are oriented so that outward normals are positively transverse .\nnoncritical level sets of a morse function are oriented so that upward pointing vectors are positively transverse .\nwhen @xmath21 is an oriented manifold , @xmath25 will refer to @xmath21 with the opposite orientation . unless stated otherwise , all diffeomorphisms and embeddings preserve orientations .\nthe first definitions involve local control in a neighborhood of a transverse knot @xmath26 . for this\nit is convenient to use `` polar coordinates '' near @xmath26 , by which we mean functions @xmath27 defining an embedding of a neighborhood @xmath28 of @xmath26 into @xmath29 , with @xmath30 mapping to polar coordinates on @xmath31 and @xmath32 mapping to @xmath2 , and such that @xmath33 .\nnote that the function @xmath34 defines a framing of @xmath26 , which we label @xmath35 .\nif @xmath26 is transverse to a contact structure @xmath14 , then we can always find _ normal _ polar coordinates on a neighborhood @xmath28 , by which we mean polar coordinates @xmath27 such that @xmath36 is spanned by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .\n( where @xmath39 means @xmath40 when @xmath14 is positive and @xmath41 when @xmath14 is negative . )\nthis follows from darboux s theorem for contact structures .\n( see , for example ,  @xcite . )\na consequence of this parametrization of @xmath42 is that , for each integer @xmath43 , the characteristic foliation on the torus @xmath44 is a family of parallel longitudes realizing the framing @xmath45 .\notherwise , the exact parametrization of @xmath42 is not particularly important and so we say that @xmath27 is an _ almost normal _ coordinate system if there exists a function @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is a normal coordinate system .\n( if @xmath27 is an almost normal coordinate system then so is @xmath48 for any @xmath49 and the relation between the framings is that @xmath50 . )\n[ d : fat ] given a knot @xmath26 in a contact @xmath51-manifold @xmath52 with a framing @xmath18 and with a chosen neighborhood @xmath28 with normal coordinates @xmath27 , we say that the coordinate system _ goes out as far as _\n@xmath18 if the image of @xmath28 in @xmath53 contains the solid torus @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .\ngiven a link @xmath16 in @xmath52 and a framing @xmath18 of @xmath16 , with @xmath56 being the framing induced on each component @xmath57 of @xmath16 , we say that @xmath16 is _ fat with respect to @xmath18 _ if there exist mutually disjoint neighborhoods @xmath58 of each @xmath57 , each with normal coordinates which go out as far as @xmath56 .\na link @xmath16 in a @xmath51-manifold @xmath21 is fibered if @xmath59 fibers over @xmath2 , and one often requires some controlled behavior of the fibration near @xmath16 . for each fiber @xmath60 , a contact structure @xmath14 on @xmath21\ninduces a ( singular ) _ characteristic foliation _ on @xmath60 , the integral curves of @xmath61 .    a _ contact vector field _\nis a vector field which preserves a given contact structure ; we will say that a contact vector field is _ transverse _ if it is everywhere transverse to the contact plane field .\nwe will be interested in transverse contact vector fields which are also transverse to the fibers of a fibration .\nsuch a vector field @xmath5 co - orients both the fibers and the plane field and hence orients the characteristic foliation on each fiber according to the following convention : at a point in @xmath21 where @xmath14 is transverse to a fiber , let @xmath62 be a 1-form with kernel @xmath14 such that @xmath63 and let @xmath64 be a 1-form with kernel tangent to the fiber such that @xmath65 .\nthen let @xmath66 be a 1-form such that @xmath67 .\nthen @xmath68 is transverse to @xmath69 so we restrict @xmath66 to define the orientation on the characteristic foliation . this orientation does not change if we replace @xmath5 with @xmath70 .\n[ d : nicefiber ] a transverse link @xmath71 is _ nicely fibered _ if there exists a fibration @xmath72 and a transverse contact vector field @xmath5 ( defined on all of @xmath21 ) satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath5 is transverse to the fibers of @xmath73 .\n* for each @xmath57 there exist almost normal polar coordinates @xmath27 on a neighborhood @xmath58 near @xmath57 such that , on @xmath58 , @xmath37 is tangent to the fibers , @xmath74 and @xmath5 and @xmath75 are both invariant under the flows of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .\n* letting @xmath5 co - orient both @xmath14 and the fibers , the oriented characteristic foliation on the fibers near each @xmath57 should point in towards @xmath57 .\n( by the previous condition the unoriented foliation will be by radial lines in each normal coordinate system . )\nsuch a fibration has a bearing on framings of @xmath16 . for each @xmath57 with normal\npolar coordinates @xmath27 as in the definition , consider a torus @xmath79 with coordinates @xmath80 .\nthe fibers of @xmath73 intersect @xmath81 in a family of parallel lines with `` slope '' @xmath82 .\na framing @xmath18 of @xmath16 also gives a family of parallel longitudes in @xmath81 with `` slope '' @xmath83 .\n( in terms of the earlier notation , @xmath84 . )\n[ d : posframing ] in this situation we say that @xmath18 is _ positive with respect to the fibration _ if , for each @xmath57 as above , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .\n[ d : enlarge ] by _ enlarging _ a symplectic manifold @xmath3 we will mean the following process : choose a smooth function @xmath87 and let @xmath88 . then attach @xmath89 to @xmath7 by the obvious identification of @xmath90 with @xmath91 . given a neighborhood @xmath92 in @xmath4 , we will say that the enlargement is _ supported inside @xmath92 _ , or simply that we are _ enlarging @xmath3 inside @xmath92 _ , if the support of @xmath93 is contained in @xmath92 .\nafter attaching @xmath89 to @xmath7 choose some extension of @xmath13 to a symplectic form on all of @xmath94 and replace @xmath3 with the new , larger symplectic manifold .\nthere is a natural identification between the old @xmath95 and the new @xmath96 .\nwhen @xmath4 is convex there is a canonical extension of @xmath13 over @xmath89 , constructed as follows : given a contact form @xmath62 on a @xmath51-manifold @xmath21 there is a canonical symplectification @xmath97 , in which @xmath98 is a symplectic dilation inducing @xmath62 on @xmath99 .\nif @xmath21 is embedded in another symplectic manifold @xmath19 with a symplectic dilation @xmath5 positively transverse to @xmath21 inducing @xmath62 , then flow along @xmath5 generates a symplectomorphism from a neighborhood of @xmath99 in @xmath100 to a neighborhood of @xmath21 in @xmath19 , restricting to the identity on @xmath21 and sending @xmath98 to @xmath5 .\nthus if @xmath62 is the induced contact form on @xmath4 and we use the form @xmath101 on @xmath102 , this will patch together smoothly with @xmath13 on @xmath7 and the symplectic dilation will extend across @xmath89 to be transverse to the new @xmath4 . furthermore the induced form on the new @xmath4 is @xmath103 , and so the underlying contact structure is unchanged . for future reference\n, we will call this enlargement the convex enlargement of height @xmath93 ; it is clearly useful if we would like to rescale the contact form on @xmath4 by some function greater than or equal to @xmath104 .\nthis is the enlargement used in the two theorems , although in theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] we will need to see the enlargement in a more general setting .\nenlarging @xmath3 does not change the diffeomorphism type of @xmath7 and so can instead be thought of as a deformation of @xmath13 keeping @xmath7 fixed .\nif @xmath16 is fat with respect to a particular framing then it is also fat with respect to any more negative framing , so theorem  [ t : weakcvx ] gives a construction that works for very negative framings but is less likely to work the more positive the framings become . if @xmath18 is positive with respect to a nice fibration then any more positive framing is also positive with respect to the fibration , so that theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] gives a construction that works for very positive framings ( assuming the fibration exists ) but is less likely to work the more negative the framings become .\nit is interesting to see these constructions alongside the construction of weinstein  @xcite mentioned earlier .\n( we use weinstein as our source because weinstein s discussion is strictly symplectic whereas eliashberg  @xcite discusses the construction in the case of stein manifolds . ) to simplify matters we present the result only in dimension four .\n[ t : weinstein ] let @xmath3 be a symplectic @xmath1-manifold with @xmath4 convex with induced contact structure @xmath14 .\nthen , given any legendrian knot @xmath105 there exists a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath19 containing @xmath3 , with @xmath20 convex , obtained by enlarging @xmath3 in a neighborhood of @xmath26 and then attaching a @xmath0-handle along @xmath26 with framing @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is the thurston - bennequin framing of @xmath26 ) .\nwe can also symplectically attach any number of 1-handles to @xmath3 to get @xmath19 with convex boundary .\n( the thurston - bennequin framing of @xmath26 is the framing given by any vector field transverse to @xmath26 but lying in @xmath14 . )\nsince any knot is @xmath108-close to a legendrian knot and every legendrian knot can be isotoped so as to make its thurston - bennequin framing more negative ( see  @xcite ) , the @xmath0-handle part of this theorem is also a construction which , given a smooth knot type , works for very negative framings but is less likely to work the more positive the framings become .\nthis result and the fact that the contact structure on a weakly convex boundary is always tight  @xcite were used by gompf  @xcite to construct many @xmath51-manifolds with tight contact structures , beginning with the standard positive contact structure on @xmath109 as the convex boundary of @xmath110 with its standard symplectic structure . consider the following observation ( suggested by john etnyre ) :    [ p : legxvrs ] suppose that @xmath26 is a legendrian knot in a positive contact @xmath51-manifold with a given neighborhood @xmath28 and a framing @xmath111 .\nthen there exists a transverse knot @xmath112 inside @xmath28 , isotopic to @xmath26 , which is fat ( inside @xmath28 ) with respect to @xmath18 .\nthis tells us that in fact theorem  [ t : weakcvx ] , together with the 1-handle part of theorem  [ t : weinstein ] , can be used to construct the same @xmath51-manifolds that gompf constructs , also with tight contact structures , but now they are weakly convex rather than convex boundaries of symplectic @xmath1-manifolds .\nconstructing manifolds with concave boundaries is interesting for two reasons .\nfirst we get some answers to a simple symplectic filling question : which @xmath51-manifolds with which contact structures can be realized as the concave boundaries of symplectic @xmath1-manifolds ? secondly , if we can carefully characterize the contact structures that result from our concave constructions , and also construct symplectic @xmath1-manifolds with convex boundaries and carefully characterize the resulting contact structures , then we may be able to use the following standard glueing construction to produce closed symplectic @xmath1-manifolds : let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be symplectic @xmath1-manifolds with @xmath115 convex and @xmath116 concave with induced contact forms @xmath117 and @xmath118 and contact structures @xmath119 and @xmath120 .\nsuppose that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are connected and that there exists a contactomorphism @xmath121 .\nthen @xmath122 for some nonzero function @xmath123 on @xmath124 . rescaling @xmath125 by a constant we can arrange that @xmath126\nlet @xmath127 .\nenlarging @xmath113 with the canonical convex enlargement of height @xmath93 will then replace @xmath117 with @xmath128 .\nthus we can in fact arrange that @xmath129 .\nfinally , @xmath113 can be glued to @xmath114 by identifying a neighborhood of @xmath115 with @xmath130 \\times \\partial x_1 , d(e^t \\alpha_1))$ ] and , using @xmath131 , identifying a neighborhood of @xmath116 with @xmath132 .    for specific examples where theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] applies ,\nobserve that the transverse unknot and the hopf link in @xmath109 with the standard contact structure are both nicely fibered , with framings greater than @xmath133 being positive with respect to the unknot fibration and framings greater than or equal to @xmath133 being positive with respect to the hopf link fibration .\nwe will see more general examples in section  [ s : cvx2ccv ] .\nas mentioned earlier , in the process of changing a convex boundary to a concave boundary by attaching handles along a nicely fibered link we encounter boundaries which are partially convex and partially concave .\nunderstanding how to control symplectic forms along such boundaries is essential to the construction .\n[ d : dcp ] a _ dilation - contraction pair _ on a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 is a pair @xmath134 of vector fields defined respectively on ( possibly empty ) open subsets @xmath135 and @xmath136 of @xmath7 such that the following equations hold ( on the sets where they make sense ) : @xmath137 a _ contact pair _ on a @xmath51-manifold @xmath21 is a pair @xmath138 of 1-forms , defined respectively on ( possibly empty ) open subsets @xmath139 of @xmath21 , such that @xmath140 and such that the following equations hold ( on the sets

positively transverse , where defined , to @xmath21 . letting @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we see that the _ induced pair _ @xmath138 is a contact pair on @xmath21 .\nnotice that , for a contact pair @xmath138 , @xmath145 is a positive contact form on @xmath146 while @xmath147 is a negative contact form on @xmath148 .\ntogether the two 1-forms give a globally defined , closed , nondegenerate @xmath0-form @xmath66 such that @xmath149 .    by a boundary which is partially convex and\npartially concave , we mean a boundary which is transversely covered by a dilation - contraction pair .\n( both convex boundaries and concave boundaries are special cases . ) by a germ of a symplectic form along a @xmath51-manifold @xmath21 we mean an equivalence class of symplectic @xmath1-manifolds containing @xmath21 , where @xmath150 if there exist neighborhoods @xmath151 of @xmath21 in @xmath152 and a symplectomorphism from @xmath153 to @xmath154 restricting to the identity on @xmath21 .\nwe will prove the following result in section  [ s : cvxccvbdries ] :    [ p : cpairsgerm ] a contact pair @xmath138 on a @xmath51-manifold @xmath21 defines a unique symplectic germ @xmath155 along @xmath21 in the following sense :    1 .\nthere exists a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 containing @xmath21 with a dilation - contraction pair transversely covering @xmath21 inducing @xmath138 .\n2 .   any other symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath113 containing @xmath21 with the property that @xmath156 represents the same germ along @xmath21 .\nthis in particular implies that the induced contact pair on a partially convex and partially concave boundary uniquely determines the germ of the symplectic form along the boundary ; we have already seen this in the purely convex and purely concave cases .\nwe will now prove these results in the following order : after establishing some terminology regarding handles , we will prove theorem  [ t : weakcvx ] and discuss the relationship with the legendrian @xmath0-handles of weinstein .\n( the constructions of the @xmath0-handles in both theorems will be closely modelled on weinstein s construction . )\nthen we will prove the necessary results on partially convex and partially concave boundaries and construct a class of symplectic @xmath0-handles for this setting . using this more general setup\nwe will prove theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] and construct some examples .\nfor background on basic tools in symplectic and contact constructions , especially various versions of darboux s theorem for symplectic and contact structures , the reader is referred to  @xcite .\nour standard model for an @xmath43-dimensional @xmath11-handle will be a subset @xmath157 of @xmath158 constructed in the following manner : let @xmath123 be a morse function on @xmath158 with a single critical point of index @xmath11 at @xmath133 , with @xmath159 .\nchoose constants @xmath160 ; @xmath157 will be a subset of @xmath161 $ ] bounded by two smooth codimension one submanifolds with boundary , the `` attaching boundary '' @xmath162 and the `` free boundary '' @xmath163 .\nsee figure  [ f : basichandle ] .\nthe attaching boundary @xmath164 is a closed tubular neighborhood of the descending sphere @xmath165 in @xmath166 , so that @xmath167 .\nthe free boundary @xmath168 begins as a tubular neighborhood of the ascending sphere @xmath169 in @xmath170 but then dips down to join @xmath162 in @xmath166 so that @xmath171 .\n( thus @xmath172 . ) some form of smooth `` interpolation '' from @xmath166 to @xmath170 must be specified to construct @xmath168 ; in our constructions we will use a vector field transverse to the level sets of @xmath123 to guide this interpolation .\nand of the result of attaching @xmath157 to a manifold @xmath7 ]    our convention is to orient @xmath162 and @xmath168 as level sets of @xmath123 , since @xmath157 is not technically a manifold with boundary .\nthis gives @xmath168 the orientation we would expect if it really were a boundary component of @xmath157 , but gives @xmath162 the nonstandard orientation ; the two orientations agree on @xmath174 .\nthe descending sphere @xmath165 comes with a canonical framing in @xmath162 which we will call the `` handle framing '' of @xmath165 .    note in the figure that @xmath175 is a codimension one submanifold , diffeomorphic to @xmath176 .\nthis `` flange '' on the handle guarantees the smoothness of the `` corners '' after attaching @xmath157 to an @xmath43-manifold @xmath7 . to attach @xmath157 to @xmath7 ,\nlet @xmath177 be @xmath7 with an open collar attached to @xmath4 .\nwe must specify an embedding of an open neighborhood of @xmath162 in @xmath158 into @xmath177 restricting to an embedding of @xmath162 into @xmath4 .\nof course , to do this we actually only need to specify the embedding of @xmath162 into @xmath4 but when we add symplectic structures we should be more careful .\nin fact in the smooth case we need only specify the image @xmath26 of @xmath165 in @xmath4 and the framing @xmath18 of @xmath26 induced by the handle framing of @xmath165 in @xmath162 to completely determine the diffeomorphism type of the result of attaching @xmath157 to @xmath7 .    to construct a symplectic handle @xmath178 and attach it symplectically to a symplectic manifold @xmath3\nrequires a symplectic structure @xmath179 on @xmath158 , an extension of @xmath13 from @xmath7 to @xmath177 , and a symplectic embedding of a neighborhood of @xmath162 into @xmath177 restricting to an embedding of @xmath162 into @xmath4 .\nif we have a symplectic dilation positively transverse to @xmath162 and another symplectic dilation positively transverse to @xmath4 , then , using the symplectification of the contact forms , we need only specify an embedding of @xmath162 into @xmath4 which preserves the induced contact forms in order to specify the symplectic embedding of a neighborhood of @xmath162 .\nif the embedding of @xmath162 into @xmath4 instead only respects the contact structures , then we must enlarge @xmath3 in a neighborhood of the image of @xmath162 and perhaps rescale @xmath179 to arrange that the embedding actually preserves the contact forms .\nthe idea in the proof of theorem  [ t : weakcvx ] is as follows : we use polar coordinates on @xmath180 , by which we mean coordinates @xmath181 where @xmath182 are polar coordinates on the respective @xmath31 factors .\nwe construct the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-handle @xmath157 as a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath183 , using the morse function @xmath184 .\nwe give @xmath183 the standard symplectic form and construct a symplectic dilation @xmath5 which is transverse to the level sets of @xmath123 wherever it is defined , but which does not extend across @xmath185 .\nwhen we construct @xmath157 , @xmath5 will be transverse to both @xmath162 and @xmath186 , but will not extend across @xmath169 .\nthus @xmath5 will induce positive contact structures on @xmath162 and on @xmath186 .\nwe will show that the contact structure on @xmath168 can be deformed in a neighborhood of @xmath169 so that it does extend across @xmath169 , maintaining the non - degeneracy condition needed to get weak convexity .\nfinally , @xmath165 will be a transverse knot in @xmath162 and we will see why a condition must be imposed on the framing in order to attach @xmath157 along a given transverse knot @xmath26 .\nthe standard symplectic form on @xmath183 is @xmath187 .\nlet @xmath188 and let @xmath189 $ ] .\nthis

modify the contact structure @xmath206 inside a neighborhood @xmath207 of @xmath169 to get a new contact structure @xmath208 which extends across @xmath169 and still satisfies the property that @xmath209 is nondegenerate .\nlet @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 goes smoothly to @xmath133 as @xmath213 goes to @xmath133 , has positive derivative and is equal to @xmath214 on @xmath215 .\nthis agrees with @xmath120 outside @xmath216 because @xmath217 , is contact because @xmath218 and satisfies the nondegeneracy condition because @xmath219 .\nintuitively , @xmath120 twists too far as we move in towards @xmath169 to extend across @xmath169 , so we back off to @xmath220 and then twist more slowly so that @xmath208 does extend .    forward flow along @xmath5 for time @xmath221 starting at a point @xmath222 gives a map @xmath223 from a subset of @xmath224 into @xmath183 defined by the following equations : @xmath225 letting @xmath226 and @xmath227 , we see that forward flow

boundary @xmath168 is the image under @xmath223 of the graph of @xmath93 in @xmath224 together with @xmath169 .\nthis construction is illustrated in figure  [ f : weakhandle ] . in the figure @xmath241 ,\n@xmath242 and @xmath243 are rather far apart for the sake of clarity , but in general one would carry out this construction with these radii only slightly larger than @xmath244 .\na few forward flow lines for @xmath5 are shown , starting on @xmath166 .     in the proof of theorem  [ t : weakcvx ] ]    the construction of @xmath208 on @xmath170 gives a positive contact structure @xmath245 on @xmath168 by letting @xmath246 on @xmath247 and letting @xmath248 elsewhere .\nthe nondegeneracy condition on @xmath208 and the fact that @xmath5 is positively transverse to @xmath168 where defined gives us that @xmath249 is nondegenerate .\nfurthermore @xmath245 agrees with @xmath250 on @xmath251 , so that if we succeed in attaching @xmath157 to @xmath3 via a contactomorphic embedding of @xmath252 into @xmath17 , the contact structures will patch together to give a contact structure @xmath253 on the boundary @xmath20 of the new symplectic manifold @xmath19 with @xmath254 nondegenerate .\nnow we show how to find this embedding and attach @xmath157 .\ngiven the transverse link @xmath255 which is fat with respect to a framing @xmath18 , consider a component @xmath26 of @xmath16 with neighborhood @xmath28 with almost normal coordinates @xmath27 which go out as far as @xmath18 .\nnotice that we can choose these coordinates so that @xmath256 .\nthis means that the

these are almost normal coordinates and we could explicitly reparametrize @xmath42 to make them normal .\nhowever it is sufficient to notice that @xmath119 is spanned by @xmath37 and @xmath261 and that this implies that , after reparametrizing @xmath42 , the coordinates would go out as far as the handle framing @xmath35 .\nthis is because we construct @xmath157 with @xmath262 .\nthis means that if we construct @xmath157 with @xmath263 small enough we can guarantee a contactomorphism from @xmath162 to @xmath264 , taking the handle framing to @xmath18 .\nan attractive feature of this construction is that it is straightforward to visualize the resulting `` contact surgery '' .\nthe new contact manifold @xmath265 is constructed from @xmath266 as follows : for each component @xmath57 of the transverse link @xmath16 , let @xmath58 be a neighborhood of @xmath57 with normal coordinates @xmath267 which go out at least as far as the framing @xmath56 .\nfor each @xmath268 choose a small positive @xmath269 so that @xmath270 is in the image of the coordinate system , where @xmath271 . for each @xmath268 remove the solid torus @xmath272 and glue back in a solid torus @xmath273 by overlapping along @xmath274 , realizing the ( topological ) surgery with framing @xmath56 .\nthen we can extend @xmath14 across @xmath273 exactly because , on @xmath275 , @xmath14 is twisting towards the longitude realizing the framing @xmath56 , which , after the surgery , will become a meridian .\nwe needed to remove at least @xmath276 because , when @xmath277 , @xmath14 has already twisted past this longitude .    to see that this construction achieves all the surgeries achievable using weinstein s legendrian surgeries\n, we now present the proof of proposition  [ p : legxvrs ] , beginning with a lemma .\n[ l : legxvrs ] if @xmath278 and @xmath279 are 1-forms on disks @xmath280 and @xmath281 such that @xmath282 then @xmath283 are positive contact forms on @xmath284 ( @xmath32 being the @xmath2-coordinate ) . if @xmath285 is a symplectomorphism then there exists a function @xmath286 such that the diffeomorphism @xmath287 given by @xmath288 satisfies @xmath289 .    that each @xmath290 is a positive contact form is a straightforward calculation . to see why the rest is true ,\nnote that since @xmath291 , the 1-form @xmath292 is closed and therefore exact .\nchoose @xmath93 so that

first show the existence and uniqueness of @xmath366 , then show that @xmath342 as described in these formulae satisfy the conditions of the lemma , and then show uniqueness of @xmath342 .\nthere exists a unique @xmath367 such that @xmath363 because contraction with @xmath66 gives a linear isomorphism from @xmath368 to @xmath369 ( this depends on working in dimension @xmath51 ) , and @xmath370 is constructed to be in this latter subspace . but @xmath366 is also in @xmath371 because @xmath372 , and thus @xmath373 .    on @xmath343 ,\nletting @xmath374 and @xmath375 , we need to show that @xmath376 first note that @xmath377 .\nequation  [ e : lagr ] is quick : @xmath378 . to show equation  [ e : lieder ] and equation  [ e : contr ] , note that @xmath379 and that @xmath380 \\\\ & = -

solutions .\nlet @xmath384 ; we will prove that @xmath385 and thus conclude that @xmath386 .\nequation  [ e : lieder ] implies that @xmath387 , equation  [ e : contr ] implies that @xmath388 and equation  [ e : lagr ] implies that @xmath389 everywhere .\nthus @xmath205 is invariant in the @xmath221 direction and vanishes when @xmath390 , so @xmath385 everywhere .\non @xmath344 the argument is a mirror image of the argument for @xmath343 .\nnote that the uniqueness argument first proved uniqueness _ along @xmath21 _\n( since @xmath388 ) and then proved uniqueness for all @xmath221 .\nthus in fact we have also proved :    [ l : undcpalongm ] in @xmath391 there exists a unique vector field @xmath341 along @xmath362 ( i.e. a section of @xmath392 ) positively transverse to @xmath362 such that @xmath393 and @xmath394 .\nlikewise there exists a unique vector field @xmath340 along @xmath362 in @xmath395 positively transverse to @xmath362 such that @xmath396 and @xmath397 .\nwe will make use of the following observation in later constructions :    [ l : bothtransverse ] given @xmath326 , let @xmath398 be the positive and negative symplectifications with the dilation - contraction pairs from lemma  [ l : exundcps ] .\nlet @xmath399 , @xmath370 and @xmath366 be as in the proof of lemma  [ l : exundcps ] . given a function @xmath400 , consider its graph @xmath401 .\nthen @xmath402 is automatically positively transverse to @xmath403 and @xmath404 is positively transverse to @xmath403 if and only if @xmath405 on @xmath362 . identifying @xmath406 with @xmath21 in the obvious way , the induced contact pair on @xmath406 is then given by @xmath407    everything follows from the explicit expressions @xmath408 and @xmath409 .\nfirst we prove existence of @xmath3 with its dilation - contraction pair @xmath134 .\nconstruct @xmath398 as in lemma  [ l : exundcps ] .\nlet @xmath410 be an open neighborhood of @xmath362 in @xmath343 such that flow along @xmath340 in @xmath344 starting from @xmath411 is defined for all times @xmath221 with @xmath412 .\nthis gives an embedding @xmath413 such that @xmath414 and @xmath415 .\nsince both @xmath98 and @xmath340 induce the same contact forms on @xmath362 and are both symplectic dilations , we can conclude that @xmath416 . by the uniqueness in lemma  [\nl : exundcps ] we also know that @xmath417 , so that @xmath418 preserves all the relevant structure .\nlet @xmath419 and @xmath420 .\nnow choose two functions @xmath421 such that @xmath422 but @xmath423 everywhere , let @xmath424 and let @xmath425 .\nfinally let @xmath426 . if we choose @xmath427 small enough we can guarantee that @xmath428 is hausdorff .\nsince @xmath429 and @xmath430 , we know that the symplectic forms and the dilation - contraction pairs patch together to define a symplectic form @xmath13 on @xmath7 with a dilation - contraction pair @xmath134 transversely covering @xmath21 inducing @xmath138 .\n( see figure  [ f : sympation ] . )\nto @xmath344 after some trimming ]    for the uniqueness result , we need to construct a bundle isomorphism @xmath431 covering the identity and preserving the symplectic forms , and then we can apply darboux s theorem . to do this\nwe construct a pair of vector fields @xmath432 along @xmath21 in @xmath433 with open domains @xmath434 covering @xmath21 , both positively transverse to @xmath21 , such that @xmath435 and such that @xmath436 .\nthen there exists a unique @xmath437 sending @xmath438 to @xmath439 by lemma  [ l : undcpalongm ] . to see the existence of the pair @xmath432 , first extend @xmath145 to a maximal rank 1-form on @xmath440 to get @xmath441 along @xmath146 such that @xmath442 .\nthen by lemma  [ l : undcpalongm ] there exists a unique @xmath382 along @xmath362 such that @xmath443 and @xmath444 .\nlet @xmath445 , a maximal rank 1-form on @xmath446 which extends @xmath447 .\nthen there exists a maximal rank extension @xmath448 of @xmath147 to @xmath449 which agrees with @xmath450 outside a closed set @xmath89 inside @xmath148 containing @xmath451 in its interior .\nlet @xmath383 be the corresponding vector field such that @xmath452 and let @xmath453 .\n[ c : diffpairssamegerm ] suppose that @xmath3 is a symplectic @xmath1-manifold with @xmath4 partially convex and partially concave , with induced contact pair @xmath454 .\nnotice that @xmath455 .\nnow suppose that @xmath456 is another contact pair on @xmath4 with @xmath457 .\nthen @xmath458 , so that @xmath4 can also be seen as partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath456 .\nthis holds in particular if @xmath456 is obtained from @xmath454 by extending or restricting the domains of the 1-forms maintaining the contact pair properties .\nnow we will show how to construct a symplectic @xmath0-handle @xmath157 according to the following plan : as in section  [ s : weakcvxbdries ] , @xmath157 will be a subset of @xmath161 \\subset ( { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^4,\\omega_0)$ ] for the morse function @xmath459 , where @xmath160 . in this case , however , we will consider a particular dilation - contraction pair @xmath134 on @xmath183 with @xmath340 defined on @xmath460 and @xmath341 on @xmath461 .\nthis pair will transversely cover both @xmath162 and @xmath168 , inducing contact pairs @xmath462 and @xmath463 .\nlet @xmath464 be the respective domains of these 1-forms ; we then have @xmath465 , @xmath466 , @xmath467 and @xmath468\n. we will use the flow along @xmath340 to guide the construction of @xmath168 .\nthe tricky point is to arrange that _ both _ vector fields end up transverse to @xmath163 .\nfor this we will use lemma  [ l : bothtransverse ] and choose our `` interpolation '' function @xmath93 carefully .\nwe use the same coordinates on @xmath166 and @xmath170 that we used in section  [ s : weakcvxbdries ] : on @xmath166 , these are @xmath469 while on @xmath170 these are @xmath203 .    to characterize the contact pairs on @xmath162 we need a little more terminology .\nlet @xmath28 be a neighborhood of a knot @xmath26 with a contact pair @xmath138 and with polar coordinates @xmath27 .\nlet the domain of @xmath332 be @xmath470 , assume that @xmath471 and @xmath472 and that @xmath27 is an almost normal coordinate system for @xmath473 .\nlet @xmath474 ( in which case the pair @xmath475 determines @xmath147 ) .\n[ d : prepsurg ] such a contact pair @xmath138 is _ well - behaved _ with respect to @xmath27 if @xmath476 and @xmath477 for constants @xmath478 with @xmath479 and @xmath89 positive .\nthe contact pair is _ prepared for surgery _ with respect to @xmath27 if we also have that @xmath480 , @xmath481 and @xmath482 . in each case\n, we may also say that the knot @xmath26 is well - behaved or prepared for surgery .\nthe fact that @xmath483 implies that @xmath484 .\nwe will call the quadruple @xmath485 the _ structural data _ for the contact pair ( with respect to the coordinate system ) ; this data completely determines @xmath138 on @xmath28 up to a reparametrization of @xmath42 .\na convenient model , given @xmath485 , is @xmath486 and @xmath487 .\n( simply verify that this is a well - behaved contact pair with the given data . )\n[ p : cphandle ] given a contact pair @xmath138 on a neighborhood @xmath28 of a knot @xmath26 which is prepared for surgery with structural data @xmath488 , there exists a handle @xmath157 such that the induced pair @xmath454 on @xmath162 is prepared for surgery with the same structural data ( with respect to the above coordinates on @xmath489 ) .\nfurthermore , with the contact pair on @xmath166 fixed , we can construct @xmath157 so as to make @xmath162 arbitrarily small as a neighborhood of @xmath165 .\nthus , given any symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath7 with boundary which is partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath138 , we can attach such a handle to @xmath7 whenever we can find a knot @xmath26 in @xmath490 which is prepared for surgery with respect to some coordinate system .\nthe coordinate system determines the framing , and the handle can be attached along an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath26 .\nthis is in contrast to the construction in section  [ s : weakcvxbdries ] , which required the attaching neighborhood to be `` fat enough '' with respect to the chosen framing .\nlet @xmath491 on @xmath183 with @xmath459 , and let @xmath492    calculation shows that @xmath134 is a dilation - contraction pair which transversely covers the level sets of @xmath123 as long as @xmath493 .\nlet @xmath494 and note that @xmath495 ( because @xmath496 and @xmath482 ) .\nchoose any @xmath194 with @xmath497 .\nthen the induced contact pair on @xmath498 is given by : @xmath499 + \\frac{1}{a } d\\lambda , \\quad \\alpha^0_1 = c d\\mu + d d\\lambda,\\ ] ] with @xmath500 forward flow along @xmath340 gives a map @xmath223 from some subset of @xmath501 into @xmath183 defined by : @xmath502 letting @xmath503 and @xmath504 ( which is positive because @xmath482 ) , we see that forward flow for time @xmath505 defines a diffeomorphism @xmath506 .\nwe can make @xmath46 arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath194 small enough .\nnow for any choice of radii @xmath507 we can build @xmath157 exactly as in section  [ s : weakcvxbdries ] , using a function @xmath233 \\to [ 0,t]$ ] which is @xmath81 on @xmath234 $ ] , decreasing on @xmath235 $ ] and @xmath133 on @xmath236 $ ] .    by construction @xmath168 is transverse to @xmath340 .\nthe only part of @xmath168 which could fail to be transverse to @xmath341 is @xmath508 . using lemma  [ l : bothtransverse ] we can state conditions for @xmath509 to be transverse to @xmath341 . using the notation from the proof of lemma  [ l : exundcps ]\nwe get : @xmath510 thus @xmath93 needs to satisfy @xmath511 for all @xmath512 $ ] .\nsince we will have @xmath513 , @xmath514 and @xmath515 , this will work as long as @xmath516 therefore if we build @xmath157 with @xmath517 we can guarantee that @xmath168 is transverse to both @xmath340 and @xmath341 .\nwe see that @xmath243 , @xmath242 and @xmath241 can be chosen arbitrarily small , as long as we choose @xmath194 small enough , so that we can arrange for @xmath162 to be an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath165 .      in order to prove theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] we will want to attach handles along well - behaved transverse knots , so now we present a method to turn well - behaved knots into knots which are prepared for surgery under certain conditions    recall that , given a neighborhood @xmath28 of a knot @xmath26 with contact structure @xmath14 , if @xmath27 is an almost normal coordinate system on @xmath28 then so is @xmath48 for any @xmath49 .\nif @xmath518 and @xmath138 is well - behaved with respect to @xmath27 then @xmath138 will also be well - behaved with respect to @xmath519 , and the structural data @xmath485 with respect to @xmath27 will change to @xmath520 with respect to @xmath519 .\nthus , if we are willing to increase framings , it is easy to arrange that @xmath521 and that @xmath522 .\nhowever it is not clear how to arrange that @xmath480 .\n[ l : wellb2prepsurg ] suppose that @xmath138 is well - behaved with respect to coordinates @xmath27 on @xmath28 with structural data @xmath485 , where @xmath481 and @xmath523 .\nthen , for any @xmath524 , there exists a function @xmath525 supported inside @xmath526 with the following properties : let @xmath527 be the positive symplectification of @xmath528 , with dilation - contraction pair @xmath134 .\nlet @xmath529 and let @xmath530 be the natural projection .\nthen @xmath531 is transverse to both vector fields , and the induced contact pair @xmath532 is prepared for surgery with respect to the coordinates @xmath533 on some ( smaller ) neighborhood of @xmath534 .\nas mentioned earlier we may assume that @xmath535 . to avoid too much notation , we will use @xmath27 on @xmath531 to refer to @xmath536 . for a given @xmath93 we will have @xmath537 on @xmath531 and lemma  [ l : bothtransverse ]\ngives us conditions for @xmath341 to be transverse to @xmath531 .\nwhen @xmath341 is also transverse to @xmath531 we get @xmath538 .\nchoose a constant @xmath539 with @xmath540 ( we have @xmath541 because @xmath542 and @xmath481 ) .\nnote that we then have @xmath543 ( because @xmath544 and @xmath481 )\n. we will construct @xmath93 so that @xmath545 on @xmath546 for some positive @xmath547 ; this together with @xmath538 gives a contact pair on @xmath531 which is prepared for surgery on @xmath548 .\nnotice that this in fact determines @xmath93 on @xmath549 $ ] because we must have @xmath550 for @xmath551 $ ] .\nwe should check that @xmath93 so defined is in fact positive : @xmath552 as long as @xmath553 , which will hold for small enough @xmath42 as long as @xmath554 , which is how we chose @xmath539 . in other words ,\nif we choose @xmath205 small enough we can guarantee that @xmath555 on @xmath556 .\nnext we check that , with @xmath93 thus defined on @xmath548 , @xmath341 is transverse to @xmath531 . calculating and applying lemma  [ l : bothtransverse ]\nwe see that transversality will hold if @xmath557 which , for our given @xmath93 , becomes : @xmath558 this holds for @xmath559 because @xmath553 and @xmath560 .\nnow we should check that we can extend @xmath93 to @xmath28 to have support inside @xmath561 for some @xmath562 , in such a way that @xmath341 remains transverse to @xmath531 . on @xmath563 the transversality condition  [ e : xvrs ] above\nwill be satisfied because @xmath93 will be identically @xmath133 and @xmath564 . for @xmath565 ,\nif we choose @xmath566 small enough we can replace condition  [ e : xvrs ] by the following simpler condition : @xmath567 using the facts that @xmath568 and @xmath89 and @xmath479 are positive , it is easy to extend @xmath93 to @xmath565 maintaining this condition if @xmath569 . if @xmath570 then , after perhaps making @xmath205 smaller still , we extend @xmath93 to @xmath571 , with @xmath572 near @xmath566 , in such a way that @xmath573 for all @xmath574 and that @xmath575 for all @xmath576 , for some small @xmath577 .\nthis is enough to conclude that conditon  [ e : xvrs2 ] is met fir @xmath565 .\n[ c : wellbenlarge ] suppose that @xmath3 is a symplectic @xmath1-manifold with @xmath4 partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath138 , that @xmath578 is a transverse knot with a neighborhood @xmath28 with coordinates @xmath27 and that @xmath138 is well - behaved with respect to @xmath27 on @xmath28 with structural data @xmath485 .\nif @xmath481 and @xmath542 then we can enlarge @xmath3 inside @xmath28 so as to arrange that @xmath4 is partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath138 which is prepared for surgery on @xmath28 with respect to @xmath27 . then we can attach a handle as in proposition  [ p : cphandle ] along @xmath26 with framing @xmath35 .\nenlarge @xmath3 using the positive symplectification of @xmath579 ( see lemma  [ l : exundcps ] ) .\nattach the subset @xmath580 of this positive symplectification , where @xmath93 comes from lemma  [ l : wellb2prepsurg ] , using the uniqueness of the symplectic germ @xmath581 .\nin theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] , after attaching the handles , @xmath20 comes with a link @xmath582 , the union of the ascending circles of the handles\n. we will now prove theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] and along the way see the following characterization of the induced negative contact form @xmath583 on @xmath20 .\n[ a : cvx2ccv ] there exists a closed tubular neighborhood @xmath584 of @xmath16 , a constant @xmath11 and a diffeomorphism @xmath131 from @xmath585 to @xmath586 such that @xmath587 for some function @xmath588 .\n[ proof of theorem  [ t : cvx2ccv ] and addendum  [ a : cvx2ccv ] ] we will first argue that we can enlarge @xmath3 so as to arrange that @xmath4 is in fact partially convex and partially concave , with induced contact pair @xmath138 , and so as to arrange that there are coordinates near each component of @xmath16 , realizing the desired framing , with respect to which @xmath138 is well - behaved satisfying the conditions of corollary  [ c : wellbenlarge ] .\nrecall the notation in the definition of `` nicely fibered '' .\nthe transverse contact vector field is @xmath5 and the fibration is @xmath589 . with @xmath3\nas given , we have some induced contact form @xmath62 on @xmath4 with @xmath9 such that @xmath590 satisfy the definition of `` nicely fibered '' .\nconsider a new contact form @xmath145 defined by @xmath591 and @xmath592 .\nnotice that we then have @xmath593 .\nthe new contact form @xmath145 has the same kernel as @xmath62 , so @xmath594 for some function @xmath595 .\nby replacing @xmath5 with @xmath70 if necessary we can arrange that @xmath596 . also note that we can replace @xmath5 with @xmath597 for any constant @xmath598 without changing the `` nicely fibered '' condition , and\nthus we can arrange that @xmath599 ( using the compactness of @xmath4 ) .\nthis means that we can enlarge @xmath3 so as to arrange that the induced contact form on @xmath4 is actually @xmath145 , using the symplectification @xmath600 .\nnow choose a constant @xmath601 so that @xmath602 on @xmath603 ( this depends on the compactness of @xmath4 and on the fact that @xmath5 and @xmath75 are invariant on a neighborhood of @xmath16 so that @xmath604 is constant near @xmath16 ) .\nlet @xmath605 and let @xmath606 .\nthen @xmath138 is a contact pair on @xmath4 with @xmath607 , so using corollary  [ c : diffpairssamegerm ] we may now regard @xmath4 as partially concave and partially convex with induced contact pair @xmath138 .\nof course @xmath145 is still defined on all of @xmath4 while @xmath147 is only defined on @xmath608 , and so for now @xmath147 contains no new information .\nhowever , when we show that @xmath138 is well - behaved near @xmath16 we will be able to attach the handles from the previous section , after which @xmath147 will extend across the new boundary and we will be able to forget about @xmath145 to conclude that the new boundary is concave . thus @xmath147 contains the seed of the concavity which we will achieve after attaching handles .\nwe see that @xmath138 is well - behaved near @xmath16 using the `` nicely fibered '' condition again . near each component\nwe know that there are normal coordinates @xmath27 such that @xmath609 , @xmath610 and such that @xmath5 and @xmath333 are invariant under the flows of @xmath37 , @xmath611 and @xmath612 .\nthis immediately establishes that @xmath613 for some constants @xmath89 and @xmath614 , and that @xmath615 for some constants @xmath616 and @xmath479 .\nnow we need to arrange that @xmath479 and @xmath89 are positive ; this will follow from the orientation condition on the characteristic foliation on the fibers .\nlooking at our orientation convention , the fact that the foliation points radially inwards means that @xmath617 . recall that we can take @xmath618 as our model , so we get that @xmath619 for small @xmath42 .\nthus either @xmath479 and @xmath89 are both positive , or if they are both negative we can replace the coordinate system with @xmath620 to get @xmath479 and @xmath89 both positive .\nnow if we arrange that each coordinate system @xmath27 for each component of @xmath16 realizes the desired framing @xmath18 of @xmath16 , we see that the condition that @xmath18 is positive with respect to the fibration @xmath73 means exactly that , near each component , @xmath621 and since @xmath544 this means that @xmath481 .\nnow we still may not have that @xmath542 . to arrange this\nwe may need to again replace @xmath333 by @xmath622 for some constant @xmath623 ( again using compactness of @xmath4 ) , which will replace @xmath89 and @xmath614 with @xmath624 and @xmath625 .\nnow corollary  [ c : wellbenlarge ] shows how to enlarge @xmath3 and attach handles .\nafter enlarging @xmath3 , we have @xmath4 partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath138 , with @xmath626 and @xmath627 . after attaching the handles @xmath20\nis partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair @xmath628 with domains @xmath629 , with @xmath630 and @xmath631 ( where @xmath582 is the union of the ascending spheres ) .\nthis means that we can ignore @xmath632 and realize that in fact @xmath20 is concave with induced negative contact form @xmath633 , and the characterization of @xmath633 in the addendum follows .\nfirst we will show that @xmath109 with surgery on either the unknot with any framing @xmath634 or the hopf link with any framing @xmath635 can be realized as the concave boundary of a symplectic @xmath1-manifold .\nlet @xmath181 be polar coordinates on @xmath183 .\nconsider @xmath636 where @xmath637 .\nthen @xmath638 is a symplectic dilation transverse to @xmath109 inducing the standard positive contact form @xmath639 on @xmath109 .\nwe compute that @xmath640 and let @xmath641 , a transverse contact vector field\n. now consider two cases :    1 .\n@xmath642 , the standard unknot .\nconsider the fibration @xmath643 and notice that @xmath644 .\npolar coordinates near @xmath26 are given by @xmath203 , from which we can verify that @xmath26 is nicely fibered with fibration @xmath73 and contact vector field @xmath5 . with respect to these coordinates\n, @xmath35 is the standard @xmath133-framing of @xmath26 , and since @xmath645 , the condition that a framing @xmath18 is positive with respective to @xmath73 is simply the condition that @xmath646 .\nthus we can attach a single `` convex - to - concave '' handle along the unknot with any framing @xmath646 to make a symplectic manifold with concave boundary .\n2 .   @xmath647 where @xmath648 , the standard hopf link .\nnow consider the fibration @xmath649 and again , @xmath644 . oriented polar coordinates near @xmath165 are as above and oriented polar coordinates near @xmath169 are given by @xmath650 and again we verify that @xmath16 is nicely fibered with fibration @xmath73 and contact vector field @xmath5 .\nalso @xmath35 is the standard @xmath133-framing of each @xmath57 .\nnow , however , @xmath651 near each @xmath57 , so the condition that a framing @xmath18 is positive with respect to @xmath73 is the condition that the framing on each @xmath57 is greater than @xmath652 .\nthus we can attach a pair of `` convex - to - concave '' handles along the hopf link as long as each handle is framed with framing @xmath133 or larger , and the result is a symplectic manifold with concave boundary .\nthe first example generalizes . given an @xmath43-punctured surface @xmath60 with a proper morse function @xmath653 with only critical points of index @xmath133 and @xmath104 , with the critical points of index @xmath133 lying in @xmath654 and those of index @xmath104 lying in @xmath655\n, we can use weinstein s construction in dimension @xmath0 to get a symplectic form @xmath656 on @xmath60 and a gradient - like symplectic dilation @xmath657 such that the structure is `` standard '' on , say , @xmath658 .\nin other words , @xmath658 looks like @xmath43 copies of @xmath659 with

.\nalternately , if the handle decomposition of @xmath60 is the usual one with one 0-handle and @xmath670 1-handles , then @xmath7 is diffeomorphic to @xmath110 with @xmath670 1-handles attached , and @xmath21 is diffeomorphic to @xmath109 with @xmath133-surgery on @xmath670 unlinked unknots .\nwe can decompose @xmath21 into two open sets : @xmath671 and @xmath672 .\nthe set @xmath616 is the complement of the @xmath43-component link @xmath673 , and the function @xmath674 is a fibration with fiber diffeomorphic to @xmath60 . to see that @xmath675 , note that this is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath676 . but @xmath677 . on @xmath479 ,\nthe entire structure is identical to @xmath43 copies of the structure described in the earlier example on @xmath109 in a neighborhood of the standard unknot .\nthus we can attach handles along @xmath16 with any framing larger than the `` @xmath133-framing '' determined by the fibration to create a concave symplectic @xmath1-manifold .    to build on these constructions\nit is worth noting a simple variation of weinstein s construction in  @xcite : suppose @xmath3 is a symplectic @xmath1-manifold with _ concave _ boundary and @xmath678 is a legendrian knot with respect to the induced negative contact structure on @xmath4 .\nthen a symplectic handle can be attached along @xmath26 with framing @xmath106 such that the new symplectic manifold again has _ concave _ boundary .\nthis can be seen as follows : weinstein s `` convex - to - convex '' @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-handles are constructed as subsets of @xmath183 using the symplectic form @xmath679 , the morse function @xmath680 and the symplectic dilation @xmath681 .\none checks that @xmath5 is positively transverse to level sets of @xmath123 and that the descending sphere @xmath682 ( for any @xmath683 ) is legendrian with respect to the induced contact structure on @xmath166 and that the handle framing of @xmath165 is one less than the thurston - bennequin framing , so that such a handle can be attached along any legendrian knot @xmath26 with framing @xmath106 . to construct `` concave - to - concave '' @xmath0-handles , use the same symplectic form and morse function but now consider the symplectic _\ncontraction _ @xmath684 .\nnow simply check that this new @xmath5 is positively transverse to level sets of @xmath123 , that @xmath165 is legendrian with respect to the induced negative contact structure on @xmath166 and that the handle framing is again equal to @xmath685 .    in our example above ( @xmath665 \\subset \\sigma \\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^2 $ ] and @xmath686 ) , the characteristic foliation on each fiber @xmath60\nis given by the flow lines of the vector field @xmath657 .\nwe can construct @xmath60 so that there will be some closed leaves of this singular foliation ( containing singular points ) .\neach such closed leaf is a legendrian knot in @xmath687 the thurston - bennequin framing of which is the framing given by the fiber .\nlet @xmath688 be the result of attaching @xmath0-handles along @xmath689 , with @xmath20 concave with induced negative contact form @xmath690 and fibered link @xmath582 .\nnotice that , under the diffeomorphism @xmath691 of addendum  [ a : cvx2ccv ] , @xmath690 induces the same characteristic foliation on the fibers of @xmath692 as @xmath62 did .\nthus the closed leaves of the foliation are again legendrian knots in @xmath693 and we can attach symplectic @xmath0-handles along these knots ( as in the previous paragraph ) with framing @xmath652 with respect to the fibers to build larger manifolds with concave boundary .\nthis increases our class of examples of @xmath51-manifolds which bound concave symplectic @xmath1-manifolds ; first perform any positive surgeries along the original @xmath43-component link @xmath16 , then perform @xmath652 surgeries on arbitrarily many copies of each closed leaf of the singular foliation ( use different fibers to get the different copies ) .\na random example of this construction is shown in figure  [ f : samplelink ] .\nthese examples are fairly immediate and we hope that more sophisticated examples can be constructed using these techniques .\nthe obvious challenge is to construct examples in which the negative contact structure on the concave boundary is recognizable as contactomorphic via an orientation reversing diffeomorphism to the positive contact structure on some other convex boundary , so that interesting closed symplectic manifolds can be constructed .", "ref": "a standard

codazzi equations and the theorem of gau - bonnet .\nso for example , in the case in which @xmath4 is closed , the constant @xmath22 becomes @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the euler characteristic of @xmath4 .\nwe remark that even in the surface case hamilton s argument is not quite sufficient for our particular setting , since we can not exclude the existence of branch points , i.e. we can not guarantee that the minimal map @xmath29 is an immersion .\nthis issue can however be overcome as we demonstrate in proposition [ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] below , where we will establish the case in which @xmath4 is a disk .\nconsider the general case in which @xmath4 is a simplicial complex .\nan inspection of the arguments described in the previous paragraph shows that if the existence of an area minimizing map @xmath25 is guaranteed , then all of hamilton s estimates can be carried out .\nhere we have to make use of the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath29 along the edges of @xmath4 , which state that around every edge the faces meet in directions that add up to zero .\nthis additional set of equations implies that certain boundary integrals arising in the application of gau - bonnet cancel each other out .\nunfortunately , an existence and regularity theory for such minimizers @xmath29 does not exist to the author s knowledge and seems to be difficult to achieve .\nwe note that , however , if we allow the combinatorial structure of @xmath4 to vary , then a result of choe ( cf @xcite)which relies heavily on this fact  states : for every riemannian metric @xmath30 on @xmath1 , there is a finite , 2-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath31 and a smooth , minimal embedding @xmath32 such that the complement of @xmath33 is a topological ball .\nsuch embeddings maps would be interesting in the final part @xcite or our series , but it seems to be difficult to control the number of vertices of @xmath31 and this number influences the bound @xmath22 in the area evolution estimate of @xmath34 .\nin fact , it is very likely that there are metrics @xmath35 on @xmath1 for which the number of vertices of the corresponding minimal simplicial complex @xmath36 diverges .    in order to get around this issue\n, we will employ the following trick . instead of looking for a minimizer of the area functional , we will find a minimizer of the perturbed functional @xmath37 here\n@xmath38 is a small constant , @xmath39 denotes the sum of the lengths of @xmath40 restricted to all edges of @xmath4 and @xmath41 is any map that is homotopic to @xmath6 .\nthe existence and regularity of a minimizer for the perturbed functional follows now easily ( apart from some issues arising from possible self - intersections of the @xmath42-skeleton ) .\nhowever , the extra term @xmath43 introduces an extra term in the euler - lagrange equations along each edge of @xmath4 and hence the boundary integrals in the evolution estimate for the minimum of this perturbed functional will not cancel each other out , but add up to a new term .\nluckily , it will turn out that this term has the right sign to derive an evolution estimate similar to ( [ eq : approximateresultevolutionofa ] ) . now letting @xmath44 go to @xmath45 , we obtain the desired evolution estimate for @xmath34 .\nthis paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spheresanddisks ] we present hamilton s area estimate for spheres ( see proposition [ prop : evolsphere ] ) and for disks ( see prop [ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] ) .\nboth of these estimates will be needed in @xcite . for spheres ,\nhamilton s argument is straight forward and the computations in this case exhibit the idea underlying the subsequent area estimates very clearly . for disks ,\nan issue arises due to possible branch points , which can be resolved by a trick . in section [ sec : defpolygonalcomplex ]\nwe define simplicial complexes and section [ sec : existenceofvminimizers ] contains the existence and regularity discussion for maps from simplicial complexes that minimize the perturbed area functional ( [ eq : perturbedareafunctionalinintro ] ) .\nthe results of this section will then be used in section [ sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] to derive the infimal area evolution estimate for simplicial complexes , i.e. the bound ( [ eq : approximateresultevolutionofa ] ) . proposition [ prop : areaevolutioninmm ] in that section will be our main result .\nwe note that sections [ sec : defpolygonalcomplex]-[sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] are independent of section [ sec : spheresanddisks ] .\nobserve that most results in this paper will be phrased in terms of ricci flows with surgery and precise cutoff @xmath46 as introduced in @xcite .\nthe reason for this is that we want to apply these results without change in @xcite .\nhowever , the possible existence of surgeries is inessential and does not create any issues .\nfor the purposes of this paper it is only important to be familiar with properties ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) of the definition of ricci flows with surgery and precise cutoff ( see ( * ? ? ? * definition [ def : precisecutoff ] ) ) .\nproperty ( 1 ) ensures that we have the bound @xmath47 for all times @xmath14 . and\nproperty ( 5 ) implies that areas can not increase by a trivial surgery .\nspecifically this property implies that for every surgery time @xmath48 whose surgeries are all trivial and every @xmath49 there is some @xmath50 such that for all @xmath51 there is a @xmath52-lipschitz map @xmath53 that is equal to the identity on the part of the manifold that is not affected by the surgery process at time @xmath48 .\nwe will be able to conclude from this property that quantities of the type @xmath26 are lower semi -

the infinitesimal change of the area of @xmath64 ( we count the area twice if @xmath64 is an @xmath65 ) while we vary the metric in positive time direction ( and keep @xmath40 constant ! ) . using the @xmath66-positivity of the curvature on @xmath67 , the fact that the interior sectional curvatures are not larger than the ambient ones as well as gau - bonnet , we conclude : @xmath68 here , @xmath69

exclude the long - time existence of short contractible loops as asserted in ( * ? ? ? * proposition [ prop : structontimeinterval ] ) .\nnote that in contrast to hamilton s setting , we can not exclude the existence of branch points at the boundary of these disks .\nthis difference creates some analytical difficulties .\n[ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] let @xmath46 be a ( 3 dimensional ) ricci

.\nnext , we use use @xcite to conclude that @xmath40 is even smooth up to the boundary and an immersion away from finitely many branch points .\nanalogously as in the proof of proposition [ prop : evolsphere ] , we can carry out the first part of the computation of the infinitesimal change of the area of @xmath40 as we vary the metric only : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the sectional curvature in the normalized tangential direction of @xmath40 .\nobserve that the last integrand is a continuous function on @xmath104 since the volume form vanishes wherever this tangential sectional curvature is not defined .    in order to avoid issues arising from possible branch points ( especially on the boundary of @xmath104 ) , we employ the following trick ( inspired by @xcite ) : let @xmath105 be a small constant and consider the flat riemannian disk @xmath106 .\nthe identity map @xmath107 is a conformal and harmonic diffeomorphism and hence the map @xmath108 is a conformal and harmonic _ embedding_. denote its image by @xmath109 . since the sectional curvatures on the target manifold @xmath110 arise from pulling back the sectional curvatures on @xmath67 via the projection onto the first factor , we have @xmath111 we can now proceed as in the proof of proposition [ prop : evolsphere ] , using the fact that the interior sectional curvatures of @xmath112 are not larger than the corresponding ambient ones as well as the theorem of gau - bonnet : @xmath113 note that @xmath114 .\nwe now estimate the last integral .\nlet @xmath115 , @xmath116 be a unit - speed

@xmath125 since @xmath126 is conformal , the first summand on the right hand side is a non - negative multiple of the second summand .\nso these summands can not have opposite signs and hence @xmath127 now note that @xmath128 is a parameterization of @xmath100 , whose geodesic curvature is bounded by @xmath129 .\nmoreover , the geodesic curvature of @xmath130 is equal to @xmath131 .\nso using ( [ eq : gammaorthogonaltonu2 ] ) we conclude that @xmath132 substituting @xmath128 by a unit speed parameterization of @xmath100 and @xmath118 by @xmath133 and using the fact that the norms of @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are bounded by @xmath42 , yields @xmath138 the @xmath131 factor disappeared in the second integral , because the new integral is taken over the boundary of the standard disk and not over @xmath139 .\nnow we let @xmath140 .\nobserve that away from the branch points of @xmath40 @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the outward - pointing unit normal vector field along @xmath100 that is tangential to @xmath40 .\nmoreover away from the branch points of @xmath40 @xmath143\nso @xmath144 combining this with ( [ eq : areaestimate1 ] ) , ( [ eq : areaestimate2 ] ) and ( [ eq : areaestimate3 ] ) yields @xmath145 so in the barrier sense @xmath146 thus @xmath147 \\leq 0.\\ ] ]    analogously as in the proof of proposition [ prop : evolsphere ] , we conclude that @xmath57 is lower semi - continuous .\nthe desired monotonicity follows now immediately .\nthe bound on @xmath82 follows again from the fact that @xmath83 .\nwe briefly recall the notion of simplicial complexes , which will be used throughout the whole paper .\nnote that in the following we will only be interested in simplicial complexes that are @xmath3 dimensional , pure and locally finite . for brevity we will always implicitly assume these properties when referring to the term `` simplicial complex '' .\n[ def : simplcomplex ] a _ @xmath3-dimensional simplicial complex _\n@xmath4 is a topological space that is the union of embedded , closed @xmath3-simplices ( triangles ) , @xmath42-simplices ( intervals ) and @xmath45-simplices ( points ) such that any two distinct simplices are either disjoint or their intersection is equal to another simplex whose dimension is strictly smaller than the maximal dimension of both simplices .\n@xmath4 is called _ finite _ if the number of these simplices is finite .    in this paper , we assume @xmath4 moreover to be _ locally finite _ and _ pure_. the first property demands that every simplex of @xmath4 is contained in only finitely many other simplices and the second property states that every @xmath45 or @xmath42-dimensional simplex is contained in a @xmath3-simplex .\nwe will also assume that all @xmath3 and @xmath42-simplices are equipped with differentiable parameterizations that are compatible with respect to restriction .\nwe will often refer to the @xmath3-simplices of @xmath4 as _ faces _ , the @xmath42-simplices as _ edges _ and the @xmath45-simplices as _ vertices_. the _\n@xmath148 is the union of all edges and the _\n@xmath149 is the union of all vertices of @xmath4 .\nthe _ valency _ of an edge @xmath150 denotes the number of adjacent faces , i.e. the number of @xmath3-simplices that contain @xmath151 .\nthe _ boundary _ @xmath7 is the union of all edges of valency @xmath42 .\nwe will also use the following notion for maps from simplicial complexes into manifolds .\nlet @xmath4 be a simplicial complex , @xmath1 an arbitrary differentiable manifold ( not necessarily @xmath0-dimensional ) and @xmath41 a continuous map .\nwe call @xmath40 _ piecewise smooth _ if @xmath40 restricted to the interior of each face of @xmath4 is smooth and bounded in @xmath152 and if @xmath40 restricted to each edge @xmath150 is smooth away from finitely many points .    given a riemannian metric @xmath30 on @xmath1 and a sufficiently regular map @xmath41 ( e.g. piecewise smooth ) we define its area , @xmath153 , to be the sum of @xmath154 over all faces @xmath155 and the length of the @xmath42-skeleton @xmath39 to be the sum of the length @xmath156 over all edges @xmath150 .\nlet in this section @xmath157 always be a compact riemannian manifold ( not necessarily @xmath0 dimensional ) with @xmath158 .\nwe will also fix the following notation : for every continuous contractible loop @xmath159 we denote by @xmath160 the infimum over the areas of all continuous maps @xmath161 that are continuously differentiable on the interior of @xmath104 , bounded in @xmath152 and for which @xmath162 .    consider a finite simplicial complex @xmath4 as well as a continuous map @xmath5 such that @xmath163 is a smooth embedding .\nthe goal of this section is motivated by the question of finding an area - minimizer within the same homotopy class of @xmath6 , i.e. a map @xmath41 that is homotopic to @xmath5 relative to @xmath7 and whose area is equal to @xmath164 ( here the maps @xmath15 are assumed to be continuous and continuously differentiable when restricted to @xmath165 and @xmath148 as well as bounded in @xmath152 when restricted to each face of @xmath4 . )\nthis problem , however , seems to be very difficult , since it is not clear how to control e.g. the length of the @xmath42-skeleta of a sequence of minimizers .    to get around these analytical issues , we instead seek to minimize the quantity @xmath166 . here\n@xmath167 denotes the sum of the lengths of all edges of @xmath4 under @xmath40 .\nit will turn out that this change has no negative effect when we apply our results to the ricci flow in section [ sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] .\nto summarize , we are looking for maps @xmath41 that are homotopic to @xmath6 relative @xmath7 and for which @xmath166 is equal ( or close ) to @xmath168 we will be able to show that such a minimizer exists in a certain sense . more specifically\n, we will find a map @xmath169 of regularity @xmath170 on the @xmath42-skeleton that can be extended onto @xmath4 to a minimizing sequence for @xmath171 .\nthis implies that the sum of @xmath172 over all faces @xmath155 plus @xmath173 is equal to @xmath174 .\nso the existence problem for @xmath40 is reduced to solving the plateau problem for each loop @xmath175 .\nthe only difficulty that we may encounter then is that @xmath175 might a priori have ( finitely or infinitely many ) self - intersections .\nunfortunately , taking this possibility into account makes several arguments quite tedious and might obscure the main idea in a forest of details .\nthe second goal of this section ( see subsection [ subsec:1skeletonstruc ] ) is to understand the geometry of a minimizer along the @xmath42-skeleton . in the case\nin which @xmath169 is injective , our findings can be presented as follows . in this case\nwe can solve the plateau problem for the loop @xmath175 for each face @xmath155 and extend @xmath169 to a map @xmath41 that is smooth on @xmath165 and @xmath170 on @xmath148 and @xmath176 on every ( closed ) face away from the vertices .\nconsider and edge @xmath177 of valency @xmath178 and denote by @xmath179 the geodesic curvature ( defined almost everywhere ) of @xmath180 and let @xmath181 be unit vector fields that are normal to @xmath180 and outward pointing tangential to @xmath40 restricted to those faces @xmath155 that are adjacent to @xmath151 .\na simple variational argument will then yield the identities @xmath182 this set of equalities and inequalities is the second main result of this section and some time is spent on expressing these identities in the case in which the loops @xmath175 are allowed to have self - intersections .\nwe remark that in the case in which @xmath183 is injective this equality and a bootstrap argument can be used to show that @xmath40 is actually smooth on each ( closed ) face away from @xmath149 .\nobserve that in general it might happen that two or more edges are mapped to the same segment under @xmath40 ( this could also happen for subsegments of these edges or for subsegments of one and the same edge ) .\nit would then become necessary to take the sum over all faces that are adjacent to either of these edges on the left hand side of ( [ eq : simplenuiskappa ] ) and a multiple of @xmath184 on the right hand side of the equation in ( [ eq : simplenuiskappa ] ) .\nthese combinatorics become even more involved by the fact that , at least a priori , @xmath175 can for example intersect in a subset of empty interior but positive measure .\nall important results of this section will be summarized in proposition [ prop : existenceofvminimizer ] .\nconsider again the given continuous map @xmath5 for which @xmath163 is a smooth embedding and let @xmath185 be a minimizing sequence for @xmath174 .\nmore specifically , we want each @xmath186 to be continuous and homotopic to @xmath6 relative @xmath7 , continuously differentiable when restricted to @xmath165 and @xmath148 as well as

is a sequence of embedded curves for which @xmath479 , then the distance between the two endpoints of @xmath480 goes to @xmath45 as @xmath208 .\nassertion ( a ) now follows directly using the methods of @xcite since in that paper the embeddedness of @xmath232 was only used for the previous conclusion .\nthe first part of assertion ( c ) follows for the same reasons .\nthe proof of assertion ( b ) in the case in which @xmath232 is @xmath481 on @xmath444 can be found in @xcite .\nwe remark that in the case , in which @xmath232 is only @xmath170 on @xmath444 and @xmath30 is locally flat on @xmath447 , assertion ( b ) is a consequence of @xcite . for our purposes , however it is enough to note that the methods of the proof of @xcite carry over to the case in which @xmath232 is only @xmath170 on @xmath444 .\nwe briefly point out how this can be done : the first step in @xcite consists of the choice of a local coordinate system @xmath400 in which @xmath232 is locally mapped to the @xmath482-axis .\nfor the subsequent estimates , this coordinate system has to be of class @xmath481 . in the case\nin which @xmath232 is only @xmath170 on @xmath444 , we can choose a sequence of coordinate systems @xmath483 that are uniformly bounded in the @xmath481 sense , and that converge to a coordinate system @xmath484 of regularity @xmath170 in every @xmath457 norm and in this coordinate system @xmath232 is locally mapped to the @xmath482-axis .\nthe minimal surface equation in the coordinate system @xmath483 implies an equation of the form @xmath485 for @xmath486 where

contained open subsets\n. a closer look at the proof of the `` hilfssatz '' in @xcite yields that for every @xmath490 we have the estimate @xmath491 on @xmath492 if @xmath204 is large depending on @xmath281 . here\n@xmath493 is independent of @xmath204 .\nit follows then that @xmath494 for every @xmath490 and large @xmath204 .\nthis implies @xmath495 and hence @xmath496 for large @xmath204 .\nstandard elliptic estimates applied to the equation @xmath497 then yield that @xmath498 for large @xmath204 .\nthe regularity of @xmath499 and the fact that branch points are isolated also follow similarly as in @xcite .\nthe second part of assertion ( c ) follows in a similar manner .\nwe just need to choose the local coordinate systems @xmath483 such that both @xmath500 and @xmath501 locally converge to the @xmath482-axis in the @xmath457 sense .\nnow consider the case in which @xmath232 does not satisfy the douglas - type condition .\nthen the remaining assertions follow from the methods of hass ( @xcite ) . for completeness\n, we briefly recall his proof .\nwe will inductively construct a ( finite or infinite ) sequence of straight segments @xmath502 between pairs of points @xmath503 with @xmath442 , such that any two distinct segments do nt intersect in their interior and such that the following holds for all @xmath504 : consider the ( unique ) extension @xmath505 of the map

the @xmath245 and some arcs of @xmath233 . )    having constructed segments @xmath508 , we will choose @xmath509 as follows : consider all components @xmath507 such that @xmath510 does not satisfy the douglas - type condition ( or to be precise , such that the loop that is composed of the restriction of @xmath232 to @xmath511 does not satisfy the douglas - type condition ) .\nif there is no such @xmath512 , then we are done .\notherwise we pick an @xmath512 for which @xmath513 is maximal . by our assumption , we can find a straight segment @xmath514 connecting two distinct parameters @xmath515 such that if we denote by @xmath516 the two components of @xmath517 , then @xmath518\nso if we choose @xmath519 for any such @xmath520 , then the extension @xmath521 still satisfies the same assumption as above .\nnow pick @xmath520 amongst all such straight segments such that @xmath522 is larger than @xmath523 times the supremum of this quantity over all such @xmath520 and set @xmath519 .\nhaving constructed the sequence @xmath524 , we let @xmath525 be the closure of @xmath526 and we let @xmath527 be the direct limit of all extensions @xmath454 . then all components @xmath528 are bounded by finitely many straight segments and arcs of @xmath233 .\nwe now show that @xmath160 is equal to the sum of @xmath529 over all such components : let @xmath530 be arbitrary , pairwise distinct components of @xmath531 .\nthen there is a @xmath532 such that for all @xmath533 these components lie in different components @xmath534 of @xmath535 .\nmoreover @xmath536 as @xmath208 .\nso @xmath537 for each @xmath538 .\nsince the choice of the @xmath539 was arbitrary , this shows that the sum of @xmath540 over all connected components @xmath528 is not larger than @xmath160 .\nthe other direction is follows from the the subadditivity of @xmath541 applied to a large but finite number of components of @xmath531 along with an isoperimetric estimate bounding the area of the remaining components .\nnext , we show that for each component @xmath528 , the loop @xmath542 satisfies the douglas - type condition . if not\n, then we could separate @xmath512 into two non - empty components @xmath516 along a straight line @xmath520 between two parameters @xmath503 for which @xmath442 such that ( [ eq : omegaomegas ] ) holds for @xmath543 instead of @xmath454 .\nchoose a sequence

{"id": "dev_longform_186", "text": "although the idea that the universe could have experienced a bounce in its remote past is old  @xcite , it has recently come under new scrutiny  @xcite with the advent of string motivated scenarios of the pre big bang kind  @xcite .\nthe main reason for this renewed interest is the fact that the most popular extensions of the standard model of high energy physics , such as string or m theory , when applied to cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _\ne.g.  _ refs .\n@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which\n, so far , has been so successful is the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds . in particular ,\nan important test is to calculate the evolution of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations through the bounce in order to see whether it can be made close to scale invariance , _\ni.e.  _ if there is any possibility , given the prebounce era , to get a harrison - zeldovich power spectrum .    from a technical point of view\n, the previous question is a nontrivial problem .\nsimple models , based on general relativity with flat spatial sections  @xcite , lead to the existence of a curvature singularity at the bounce itself and therefore do not seem to represent viable physical models .\nin addition , it is difficult to understand how meaningful a perturbative scheme around a singular solution would be ( see however ref .\n@xcite ) , so we shall assume that the question of the calculation of the cosmological perturbations can not be addressed in this way ( see ref .\n@xcite for more detailed discussions ) .\nin fact , it is believed that , in the vicinity of the bounce , string corrections become important  @xcite . typically , these corrections add to the gravity sector terms such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the riemann tensor and @xmath3 the curvature scalar  @xcite , and higher order terms in the curvature .\nthe effect of these terms is , except in some specific instances  @xcite , to smooth out the singularity  @xcite ( see also ref .\n@xcite ) ; this is , from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected .\nunfortunately , one can show that the process of adding up more and more high curvature corrections does not lead to convergence towards a single solution , _\ni.e.  _ this solution explicitly depends on the choice of the stringy corrections  @xcite .\nthis means that , at each order , the bouncing scale factor looks completely different from the scale factor obtained at the previous order . nevertheless , at a fixed order in the string corrections\n, one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .\nthe main disadvantage of the procedure is that it renders the computation extremely complicated and only numerical calculations are available to make the problem tractable .\nan important point to be noticed is that , as already mentioned above , most models assume that the spatial sections are flat all the time whereas , at the bounce , the curvature term is expected to play a crucial role .\ntherefore , it seems that for a bouncing universe , one can not just throw away the curvature term because it does not play a significant role as it is the case for an inflationary universe .\nin fact , in that regard , the situation is the opposite of inflation : during the final stages of inflation , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the three - curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , whereas even though the curvature may be negligible either in the remote past or in the future of the bounce , it has almost certainly no reason to be so in general .\na way out to the previous difficulties , which would permit to undertake a tractable analytical calculation of the power spectrum , is the following .\nfar from the bounce , one usually considers the situation for which the curvature is small , even though the implementation of this particular point may not be in itself a trivial task . in this case\n, one can consider that , during the contracting and expanding phases , the spatial sections are essentially flat so that the well known results stemming from the theory of cosmological perturbations can be straightforwardly applied .\nthen , the main question becomes the effect of the bounce itself on the pre - bounce power spectrum .\ntechnically , this problem can be formulated as follows  @xcite . before the bounce ,\nthe perturbations are characterized by two modes , a dominant ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and a sub - dominant ( @xmath5 ) one . with @xmath6 representing the comoving wave number of a given fourier mode , we write the @xmath6 dependence of these modes as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the same manner , after the bounce , one decomposes the perturbation as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .\nthe effect of the bounce is then entirely encoded into the form of the transition matrix @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 the mode of interest is of course the dominant mode in the expanding phase , @xmath13 .\nthis equation corresponds to a general `` @xmath6-mode mixing , '' _\ni.e.  _ the dominant mode after the bounce is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .-\nmode mixing '' in order to emphasize that this mode mixing is valid for a fixed fourier mode and should not be confused with the mode mixing coming from nonlinearities which involves modes with different wave numbers . ]    _ a priori _ , various different situations can occur : the dominant mode in the contracting phase could acquire a scale invariant spectrum which is not conveyed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase because it turns out that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( `` @xmath6-mode inversion , '' the scale invariant piece is passed to the `` wrong mode '' in the expanding phase ) ; this is for instance what occurs if one applies the usual israel junction conditions , known to apply for other cosmological transitions , at the bounce point  @xcite .\nanother possibility is that the dominant mode in the contracting phase be scale invariant but that this property is lost through the bounce due to a nontrivial @xmath6 dependence of the coefficient @xmath16 .\nnote that the opposite situation may also occur , for which the spectrum is initially not scale invariant but is turned into it because of a nontrivial @xmath6 dependence of the transition matrix .\nin fact , the common view concerning these last possibilities is that , for scales of astrophysical interest today , the bounce , lasting a short time , is expected to have no noticeable effect on those large scales  @xcite .\nthis is sometimes argued to come from general arguments such as `` causality , '' a point which is discussed thoroughly in ref .  @xcite .\nfor instance , this is a basic assumption in the perturbation spectrum calculations in the pre big bang scenario  @xcite .\ntechnically , this means that the transfer matrix is assumed not to depend on @xmath6  @xcite . within this framework\n, the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase , _\ni.e.  _ to insure that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion\n.    the present article aims at examining whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is @xmath6-independent is generically valid or not . for this purpose\n, we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce .\nwe choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section ( see the remarks above ) , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref .\nwe do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce , and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase .\ntherefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the expanding phase with flat spatial sections , as already considered in the literature .\nthis article is organized as follows . in the following section , we set the precise model and derive the basic equations both for the background and the perturbations .\nwe then discuss how one can model a bounce in this framework and derive an explicit form for the potential of the scalar part of the classical perturbations ( bardeen potential ) whose properties we then examine in details .\nthis leads us to the main calculation of this article , namely that of the transfer matrix of eq .\n( [ transt ] ) .\nwe show that this matrix depends on @xmath6 in a nontrivial way provided that the null energy condition ( nec ) is very close to being violated at the bounce .\nthis illustrates , by means of a specific example , that the general argument according to which the limited but nonvanishing bounce duration could not affect the spectrum of long ( _ i.e .\n_ longer that the duration itself ) wavelength modes , is incorrect .\nwe conclude by discussing this result , also showing that in the case under consideration , the propagation of gravitational waves ( tensor modes ) is qualitatively different of that of scalar modes since the former are never affected by the bounce .\nwe assume that the background model is given by a friedmann -

provided @xmath164 , _\ni.e.  _ if @xmath165 : indeed , one has @xmath166 a relation which we shall use in the rest of the paper to define @xmath161 in a solution - independent way . as emphasized before , the case @xmath167 corresponds to a constant scalar field potential and to an equation of state @xmath168 and is thus the exact counterpart of the inflationary de sitter solution .\nthe

.\n[ phiphop ] and [ vphi ] , one sees that the universe starts at either a maximum or a minimum of the potential , in both cases with a nonvanishing amount of kinetic energy in the scalar field @xmath173 .\none remarkable property of the above model is that the effective potential for density perturbations remains very simple even if @xmath174 . indeed , assuming the de sitter like solution ( [ ds ] ) and plugging it into the form ( [ deftheta ] ) yields @xmath175 which , together with @xmath176 [ this stems from eq .\n( [ cs2 ] ) with the solution ( [ ds ] ) and the scalar field ( [

this potential is given for the limiting case @xmath178 , and it is @xmath179 : this potential can only interact with the modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which we already mentioned are gauge modes .\nthis was to be expected since the exact de sitter solution , in this bouncing situation as in the more usual inflationary scenario , does not amplify scalar perturbations by any amount .\nwe believe that this is what happens in fig .  4 of ref .\n@xcite in which the bardeen potential mode @xmath180 is seen to oscillate while passing through a de sitter - like bounce , reflecting the nondomination of the potential at this point .\nwe now assume that the universe experiences a regular bounce at the time @xmath181 .\nthis means there exists a particular function @xmath66 which can always be taylor expanded in the vicinity of @xmath182 .\nsince we are interested in understanding the behavior of the perturbations through the bounce , and because the effective potentials for density perturbations involve derivatives of the scale factor only up to the fourth order , a description of the scale factor up to @xmath183 only is sufficient .\nwe therefore set @xmath184\\ , ,

chosen such that @xmath142 is greater than unity , which is only a necessary condition as discussed below . the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath142 also provide the tangent de sitter - like solution  ( [ ds ] ) , whereas @xmath186 and @xmath187 measure the deviation with respect to this de sitter - like solution .\n( [ aseries ] ) represents a double expansion , both around @xmath181 and around the de sitter - like solution discussed in the previous section since @xmath188 exactly corresponds to the small @xmath189 expansion of the scale factor ( [ ds ] ) ; this explains , among others , the factor @xmath190 in this equation .\nthe parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 are in a certain sense similar to the traditional slow - roll parameters . both the de sitter form and its approximations are shown in fig\n[ scales ] as functions of the conformal time .\nwe now discuss how the general expansion  ( [ aseries ] ) can be related to an underlying particle physics model .\nthe scale factor is entirely specified once the scalar field potential @xmath24 and the initial conditions , for instance the values of the scalar field and its first derivative at the bounce : @xmath191 , @xmath192 , have been chosen .\nthis means that there exists a relation between these last quantities and the parameters @xmath185 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 characterizing the expansion  ( [ aseries ] ) .\nwe now establish what this relation is .\nthis can be done easily by solving the einstein equations  ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) in the vicinity of the bounce . in practice , we insert the taylor expansion of the scalar field , @xmath196 and of the scale factor , eq .\n( [ aseries ] ) , in eqs .\n( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) and identify , order by order , the various terms appearing in the resulting expressions . to zeroth order , this gives @xmath197 the last relation can also be re - written as @xmath198 as expected from eqs .\n( [ nec ] ) and ( [ limnec ] ) .\nwe see that the magnitude of the scalar field conformal time gradient at the bounce determines the value of the parameter @xmath161 .\ntypically , one expects @xmath199 since the order of magnitude of the scalar field and its derivatives should be such that @xmath200 in order for the field theory to make sense .\nif the velocity of the field vanishes at the bounce , then @xmath201 .\nto first order , the

of satisfying the einstein equations .\neither the kinetic energy vanishes at the bounce or @xmath204 but then @xmath205 and @xmath206 .\nthis means that the bounce occurs at the minimum of the scalar field potential .\nthis also implies that , in this case , the minimum of the potential can not vanish , @xmath207 , see eq .\n( [ a0 ] ) .\nif , for instance , the potential is given by @xmath208 , as is the case for instance of the model studied in ref .\n@xcite , then the only way to have a symmetric bounce is to satisfy the condition @xmath209 at the bounce and , as a consequence , one necessarily has @xmath201 . in the following , we will be mainly interested in the second situation , _\ni.e.  _ @xmath204 , since we will show that amplitude of the spectrum is controlled by the parameter @xmath161 . in this case\n, going to the next order allows us to determine what the parameter @xmath195 is .\nthe result reads @xmath210 + ( 6-\\kappa \\varphi _ 0'^2)^2\\varphi

order derivative of the potential at the bounce .    assuming a symmetric bounce for now on , _\ni.e.  _ setting @xmath211 , some restrictions can be put on the numerical value of @xmath187 .\nthey stem from the fact that we demand @xmath66 to be positive in the range @xmath212 and to describe a bounce , _\n@xmath213 for @xmath214 .\nthis latter condition turns out to be more stringent and implies @xmath215 .\nmoreover , if we further require that the scale factor ( [ aseries ] ) be solution of einstein equation sourced by a single scalar field , we see from eq .\n( [ nec ] ) that @xmath216 must be positive . around the bounce , this is @xmath217,\\ ] ] which will be positive definite in a small but finite neighborhood of @xmath181 provided @xmath218 in the limit @xmath219 we will be concerned with . combining both constraints ,\nwe arrive at @xmath220 the approximation method we discuss later does not allow to consider very small values for @xmath187 , so that in practice , we shall use @xmath221 .\nwe now assume the fiducial expansion ( [ aseries ] ) for the bounce through which we want to propagate the perturbations .\nlet us however first examine the connection of this bounce to the standard cosmological epochs of radiation and matter domination .      in this section , we study how the bounce that we described previously can be connected to an epoch of the standard hot big bang model .\nin particular , we study the connection with a radiation dominated era . in this case\n, the scale factor can be written as @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are two parameters to be fixed with the help of the matching conditions .\nwe match this scale factor to the bouncing scale factor given by eq .\n( [ aseries ] ) , using the junction conditions , known to be valid even in the curved spatial section case , as derived in ref .\n@xcite , namely @xmath225=[a']=0 $ ] .\nthe matching is performed at @xmath226 such that @xmath227 in order for our quartic approximation of the scale factor to still be meaningful .\nthe matching conditions imply that the hubble parameter at the matching time is given by @xmath228 where @xmath229 . from the above formula\n, one sees that it is not possible to connect the bounce to an epoch where the curvature is negligible , provided the null energy condition , which demands @xmath230 [ see discussion around eq .\n( [ limnec ] ) ] , is still satisfied . as a consequence\n, this implies that @xmath231 can not be large in comparison to @xmath232 ; in fact , since @xmath233 and @xmath234 , @xmath235 is expected to be negligibly small compared to unity right after the bounce .\nthis means that one necessarily connects the bounce to a regime where the curvature is important or , in other words , in a region where the sine function appearing in the scale factor  ( [ scalerad ] ) can not be approximated by the first term of the taylor expansion , @xmath236 .\nthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to violate the null energy condition , as already noticed in ref .\n@xcite and to have a small @xmath193 but then it would have been useless to consider the case @xmath237 for modeling the bounce since this was done precisely in order to satisfy this condition .\ntherefore , we conclude that between the bounce and the standard hot big bang , another phase must necessary occur whose main effect will be to drive @xmath238 to sufficiently large values .\nthis is usually the role played by a phase of inflation .    with the general framework\nthus clarified , let us turn to the evolution of the scalar gravitational perturbations through the bounce by means of evaluating the effective potential for the variable @xmath96 related with the bardeen potential through eq .\n( [ defu ] ) .\nwe discuss the potential for the variable @xmath126 in the discussion section [ uetv ] below .              as a function of rescaled conformal time @xmath240 for @xmath139 as derived using either the assumption that the scale factor behaves as a square root , _\ni.e.  _ @xmath241 , ( full line ) or eq .\n( [ aseries ] ) up to quadratic ( dotted line ) and quartic order with @xmath242 and @xmath243 ( dashed line ) .\nthe quartic approximation is extremely close to the exact solution , exemplifying its accuracy , while the quadratic approximation appears to be at best qualitatively correct.,width=340 ]    the effective potential for the variable @xmath96 in the de sitter - like solution is , according to eq .\n( [ dsvu ] ) , constant in time .\nthis is however very specific to this particular solution , as any displacement away from it immediately leads to a different form of the potential .\nthis is illustrated in fig .\n[ dspot ] which shows the relative accuracy of the expansion ( [ aseries ] ) around the de sitter - like solution ( [ ds ] ) .\nit is also clear from the figure that the expansion ( [ aseries ] ) , if pushed to sufficiently high orders in @xmath189 , gives back the correct constant value over a large range of conformal times .\nlet us now turn to the more general bounce case of eq .\n( [ aseries ] ) .\narbitrary values for the parameter @xmath187 restricted to the range of interest discussed above lead to the generic shape illustrated in fig .\nthe calculation of the effective potential is extremely complicated even with the quartic approximation of the scale factor . even if it can be done in full generality since , for a scale factor given by eq .\n( [ aseries ] ) , the potential @xmath244 reads @xmath245 where @xmath246 and @xmath247 are two polynomials of order @xmath248 , in practice the calculation is not tractable .\nhowever , since in practice we always have @xmath249 , only the first monomials are important .\none can check that the following approximation @xmath250 is extremely good , see fig .\n[ fitprd ] . in this expression , we have only kept the first two monomials at the numerator and the first three ones at the denominator .\n[ full line , eq .\n( [ vureal ] ) ] and its approximation stemming from eq .\n( [ approxvu ] ) @xmath251 ( dot - dashed line ) in full details with the same parameters as

can be written as @xmath254 equipped with eq .\n( [ approxvu ] ) , we can now compute the height and the position of the central peak and of the wings .\nlet us start with the central peak .\nthe absolute value of @xmath239 at @xmath182 is given by @xmath255 the most important property of the above formula is that it diverges as @xmath256 .\nit is shown in ref .\n@xcite that this property also holds in the case @xmath257 , and is therefore generic , _\ni.e.  _ not restricted to symmetric bounces .\nwe have seen previously that the values of @xmath65 of astrophysical interest are such that @xmath258 .\ntherefore , a necessary condition for the bounce to affect the spectrum of the fluctuations is that @xmath193 be close to one .\nas already discussed , the physical interpretation is that one must be very close to a violation of the null energy condition . in this case\n, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq .\n( [ upsilon ] ) . in practice\n, @xmath161 must be a tiny number in order to get a modification of the spectrum .\nwe have seen that this is to be expected since @xmath161 is the square of the ratio of the scalar field conformal time gradient at the bounce to the planck mass .\nthe amplitude of @xmath161 controls the maximum value of @xmath65 below which the perturbation modes will be affected by the bounce .\nthe crucial point is that for @xmath199 , large scales , having cosmological and astrophysical relevance , can be modified as they evolve through the bounce .\nassuming for now on that @xmath199 , it is sufficient to taylor expand everything in terms of this parameter to get an accurate approximation . for @xmath259 ,\none gets @xmath260 another interesting quantity is the time @xmath261 for which @xmath262 , see fig .\n[ fitprd ] .\nthis time is given by @xmath263 which leads to @xmath264 the above equations means that , in the limit @xmath265 , the width of the potential goes to zero while its height increases unboundedly .\nfinally , let us describe the wings of the potential .\nthe position of the wings can be derived from the condition @xmath266 ( @xmath267 ) .\nthis gives @xmath268\\ , , \\ ]

wings is just given by @xmath272 and can be expressed as @xmath273 the height of the wing also diverges as one approaches the violation of the null energy condition and , at first order in @xmath161 , one has @xmath274 .\nthis concludes the description of the perturbation potential with which we now examine the fate of the perturbations themselves .\nthe purpose of this section , which is also our main result , is to show that the transfer matrix @xmath275 of eq .\n( [ transt ] ) may depend on the wave number @xmath65 in a way which we derive .\nwe found that two completely different and independent methods , one based on a piecewise expansion of the potential and the other assuming the potential to behave mathematically as a distribution rather than a simple function in the limit @xmath219 , lead to comparable results , both for the final spectrum itself and its magnitude .\nwe examine these methods in turn .      when trying to evaluate the transfer matrix of eq .\n( [ transt ] ) with the potential @xmath276 derived in the previous section , one immediately faces a difficulty , namely that unfortunately , even with the simple form given by eq .\n( [ approxvu ] ) , the equation of motion of the variable @xmath96 is not integrable analytically .\nhowever , one can find piecewise solutions . for a mode which interacts only with the central peak of the barrier , _\ni.e.  _ which is above the wings , the potential is essentially zero for @xmath277 .\nthis corresponds to regions i and iii in fig .\n[ fitprd ] . in the central region , region ii in fig .\n[

@xmath311 is obviously the identity .\nnote also that , in the former case , the transfer matrix is @xmath65-dependent .\nthis means that the bounce affects the spectrum and therefore disproves _ a priori  _ any general argument stating that the spectrum should propagate through the bounce without being modified  @xcite .\nbesides , we see that the amplitude is divergent as @xmath161 goes to zero\n. however , one should remember that we are not interested in the spectrum of @xmath96 itself but rather in the spectrum of the bardeen potential @xmath130 . the relation between @xmath130 and @xmath96 , eq .\n( [ defu ] ) , together with eq .\n( [ limnec ] ) , leads to the remarkable result that the terms in @xmath161 cancel out exactly and that the resulting spectrum is @xmath161-independent , and thus perfectly finite even in the @xmath219 limit .\nfinally , the @xmath187 dependence of the overall amplitude is also predicted by this calculation .\nas expected , there is no net effect in the limit @xmath312 at which the bounce is effectively de sitter and thus can amplify no amount of perturbation . in this last case , the calculation leading to eq .\n( [ tumatch ] ) is not accurate enough and should be done at a higher order in @xmath161 since the leading order vanishes ; one should then find that the transition matrix is essentially the identity ( de sitter ) plus some correction vanishing in the limit @xmath219 .\nwe show in this section that the previous result can be understood in very simple terms and that the result of the previous section can be reproduced by a back - of - the - envelope calculation .\nthe crucial observation is that the height of the potential @xmath313 diverges as @xmath161 goes to zero while its width shrinks to zero .\nthis suggests that there is something like a dirac @xmath194-function at play . in this section\n, this is merely a computational artifact allowing an easy calculation of the effect .\nthe true value of @xmath161 must be nonvanishing , although tiny , so the calculation of this section is accurate only for those modes interacting with the potential . therefore , the presence of the dirac distribution in no way implies the existence of a singular behavior either of the potential @xmath244 or of the modes @xmath314 themselves as long as @xmath315 . ] to study this point we

@xmath326 as @xmath219 , @xmath327 it is interesting to compare eq .\n( [ tumatch ] ) with eq .\n( [ tudelta ] ) .\nthe numerical coefficient in the above equation is @xmath328 , to be compared with the coefficient @xmath329 found in eq .\n( [ tumatch ] ) .\nthe difference is approximatively a factor @xmath330 in the amplitude .\nthis difference can be interpreted in the following way .\nwhen the matrix transfer is computed using the matching procedure , one uses the parabola formula for the potential and one neglects the wings of the potential . the area of the central part of the potential is given by @xmath331 we see that there is factor @xmath332 between the area below the central part and the area below the whole potential including the wings . since the matching procedure is sensitive to the central part only whereas the calculation of the dirac @xmath194-function is sensitive to the whole potential , we therefore expect a factor @xmath332 between the corresponding two amplitudes .\nwe have @xmath333 and hence we recover approximatively the factor @xmath330 mentioned above . the correct amplitude is the one given by the dirac @xmath194-function calculation and is @xmath334 .\nwe now complete the description of the propagation of perturbations through a general relativistic bounce by some considerations regarding the variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 , the spectrum of tensor modes and a comparison with other known transitions in cosmology .\nan interesting issue , debated at length in the literature  @xcite , is how the variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 behave as they go through the bounce . as a first step towards understanding what is the variable that is the most useful ,\nlet us construct the potentials for both , as in fig .\nit is clear from this figure that the terms appearing in the potential for the variable @xmath126 , namely @xmath335 never compensate each others , as was found to be the case for @xmath313 of eq .\n( [ vureal ] ) , so the resulting potential is divergent at some points which , furthermore , depend on the wavelength index @xmath65 .\nthis provides a first hint that @xmath126 is not the correct variable to work with , and indicates that as one approaches the bounce , or as the curvature becomes non - negligible , @xmath126 ceases to be the good quantum variable ( see _ e.g.  _ ref .\n@xcite ) .     and @xmath336 for the perturbation variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 in the special case of the square root form for the scale factor as in fig .\n[ vu24 ] [ or eq .  ( [ aseries ] ) with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , the corresponding curves being visually undistinguishable ] with @xmath139 . according to eqs .\n( [ eomu ] ) and ( [ eov ] ) , the potentials depend on three possible terms , namely @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath134 , respectively plotted as the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves .\nthe potential for @xmath96 is also shown as the full line .\nthe pole at @xmath181 in either @xmath337 and @xmath338 appears with opposite sign but is otherwise the same , so there is an exact compensation , so that the full potential is everywhere well - behaved .\nthis is clearly not possible for the potential @xmath336 , since there are more poles in @xmath134 than there are in @xmath338 , so no compensation can occur at these points , but also the pole at @xmath181 appear with the same sign ; the potential for the function @xmath126 follows @xmath134 , up to small corrections and was therefore not plotted here.,width=340 ]    in the present context , it is easy to show that @xmath96 and @xmath126 are related by the following relation : @xmath339\\ , .\\ ] ] we know from the previous considerations that @xmath96 is continuous and that @xmath292 may have a finite jump at @xmath182 provided @xmath161 is small enough . from the above equation ,\nwe conclude that the variable @xmath126 possesses divergences during the bounce .\nthese divergences are given by the zeros of the argument of the square root at the denominator of the previous equation .\nin other words , @xmath126 diverges when @xmath340 as found in fig .\n[ vuvv ] .\nsome remarks are in order at that point .\nfirst , an interesting feature is that @xmath341 at the bounce ( hence is regular ) and that the divergences occur before and after the bounce but not at the bounce itself even though its potential actually diverges at this point .\nthis is because the effective velocity of sound diverges at the bounce .\nsecondly , the time at which @xmath126 divergences is @xmath65-dependent as can clearly be seen from eq .\n( [ blowv ] ) .\nthirdly , the physical interpretation of this divergence is subtle . if @xmath126 had the usual interpretation ( _ i.e .  _\nthe variable that is canonically quantized ) , the divergence would clearly be a problem . roughly speaking\n, this would mean explosive particle creations and , as a consequence that there is a back - reaction problem .\nmore seriously , this divergence would be at odd with the fact that the bardeen potential remains finite and small . as already discussed below eq .\n( [ defv ] ) , there are reasons to believe that , in the case @xmath57 , the variable @xmath126 introduced before is not the variable that appears in the action for cosmological perturbations .\nthis last variable should remain finite during the bounce .\nthe evolution of the tensorial modes of perturbations @xmath342 , where @xmath343 is , roughly speaking , the amplitude of the gravitational wave , stems from the relation  @xcite @xmath344 \\mu=0,\\ ] ] _\ni.e.  _ an equation similar to that valid for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath345 . within the framework of our bouncing solution ,\nthis is @xmath346 which can be simply analyzed as follows .    as direct calculation reveals , the potential @xmath347 of eq .\n( [ vh ] ) has either a single maximum located at @xmath181 if the expansion parameter @xmath348 , or a minimum at @xmath181 and two maxima at the points @xmath349 given by @xmath350 provided @xmath351 . in the latter case , the maximum value attained by the gravitational wave potential is @xmath352 since @xmath353 and @xmath354 , this means that the maximum value for the potential is less than @xmath355 in all cases of physical interest . in other words , and since in these units the cosmologically relevant modes are those having @xmath258 , the potential is dominated at all times during the bounce itself , and therefore can not lead to tensor mode production .\nthere is therefore a qualitative difference between the tensor and the scalar modes since the latter can be affected by the bounce provided the nec is almost violated , while the former are never affected , regardless of the underlying parameter values .      in order to make a comparison of our bouncing era to other known transitions\n, we first consider below the radiation to matter transition under the hypothesis that this occurs , as observation demands , at some time @xmath356 such that the three - space curvature is negligible .\nin other words , we study this transition with @xmath110 .\nthe scale factor can be given the form @xmath357 , \\label{aradmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath358 is chosen such that @xmath359 .\nwe have emphasized the two different normalization factors @xmath360 and @xmath361 because they play a different role in the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 .\nindeed , the potential for @xmath126 in this case is @xmath362 , which , for a purely radiation dominated universe ( _ i.e .  _ with @xmath363 and @xmath364 ) , is identically vanishing , whereas the potential for @xmath96 is @xmath365''/\\left [ \\left(a\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\right)^{-1}\\right]$ ] , which in the same situation would be @xmath366 . during the transition however ,\nthe presence of an amount of matter , however tiny , leads to a nonvanishing @xmath361 , and hence a nonzero diverging term for small conformal times @xmath367 : the radiation dominated universe represents a singular limiting case .\nthis means that both potentials are large already at small times , deep into the radiation era , and the approximation @xmath368 is accurate both before and after the transition and for both variables .\nthis accounts for the fact that the bardeen potential changes during the transition , but only insofar as the amplitude is concerned , leaving its spectrum unaltered .\nthis is because , in this situation , there is no potential crossing : the modes are always below the barrier . fig .  [ 910 ] illustrates this fact and summarizes the situation by showing a sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .     for the perturbation variables\n@xmath314 or @xmath370 for the radiation to matter transition , derived from the scale factor given by eq .\n( [ aradmat ] ) .\nthis log - log sketch shows the potential ( full line ) for either of the variables ( they differ by numerical factors ) as well as the exact solution ( for @xmath371 ) for the bardeen potential ( dashed line ) as a function of conformal time.,width=321 ]    another situation of cosmological interest to compare the bounce with is a phase of quasi - exponential inflation followed by preheating and the subsequent epoch of radiation domination . when only one field is present\n, the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 are essentially undistinguishable and both coincide numerically with the inverse hubble size @xmath235 , as shown schematically in fig .\n[ infrde ] . for more than one field ,\nthe situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential  @xcite .\nfor a given wave number @xmath6 , the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , which is often phrased , because of the similarity with the hubble scale , as `` horizon exit '' ( see ref .\n@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point , and ref .\n@xcite in the bounce context ) . as illustrated in fig .\n[ infrde ] , the crucial difference between the two situations , namely preheating and bounce transitions , is that in the latter case the potential and the hubble scale behave in completely different ways whereas they correspond in the former , at least in the region of potential crossing .\nfar from the bounce itself , however , the potential tends to @xmath235 again , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation .\nwe conclude that in the bounce case , the potential is the quantity that matters and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . as a consequence , for practical calculatory purposes , the phrase `` hubble crossing '' appears misleading in this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .\nin this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed spatial section case in order to satisfy the null energy condition\n, we were able to develop a general formalism by expanding any bouncing scale factor around the @xmath57 de sitter - like bouncing solution .\nthis expansion is characterized by two parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 which , in some sense , are the counterparts of the slow - roll parameters in the usual inflationary models  @xcite . because this expansion permits a general calculation of the potential for the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations , this allows to fully determine the structure of their evolution as they propagate across the bounce .\nthe potential @xmath313 obtained is radically different from the hubble scale at the relevant times .\nthis has to be contrasted with the inflationary paradigm for which @xmath235 and @xmath313 are almost identical .     for the perturbation variables @xmath314 for our bounce model when one connects this bounce transition to both a previous contracting phase on one side and to the usual radiation dominated phase later on the other side.,width=321 ]\nan important conclusion of this work is that a bounce phase , even a short one , can affect large scales of perturbations .\ngeneral arguments aiming at showing the contrary therefore suffer from our counter - example .\nthe bounce itself is part of the mechanism described in the introduction , so that the transfer matrix we obtained participates to the one of eq .\n( [ transt ] ) through @xmath372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig .\n[ sketch ] .\nthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 .\nin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref .\n@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref .\n@xcite .\nparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation .\nnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly .\nthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a kinetic energy density ( not the scalar field itself ) for the scalar field comparable to the planck scale , which may render the semi - classical field theory dubious\n.    this can be particularly important in view of the string motivated potential alternatives to inflation of the pre big bang kind if it turns out that these models might lead to such spectral corrections as discussed above .\nthis condition needs be verified in each particular situation .\nfor instance , in the pre big bang case , one would need to model the bounce occurring in the einstein frame , in which our formalism is well suited , to see what the behaviour of @xmath313 is in this context . therefore , and unfortunately , one consequence of the failure of any general argument preventing any alteration of the spectrum is that one needs to explicitly model a regime in which higher order string corrections are dominant . avoiding this was the main interest of the general argument in question .\nwe also obtained that the relevant propagation variable is not @xmath126 , whose flat space equivalent is commonly used for quantization , _\ni.e.  _ for setting up the initial conditions , but rather the intermediate variable @xmath96 , directly related to the bardeen potential .\nthis is to be compared with what was recently obtained in ref .\n@xcite , based on a completely different theory of gravity , in which neither variable happens to be bounded at the bounce .\nthe spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces .\nthis exemplifies the fact that there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce .\nthe picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig .\n[ sketch ] and consists in a regime in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well suited , as is the case for instance in many string motivated scenarios  @xcite ; this first phase allows an easy calculation of a spectrum of perturbation that would be sort of pre - primordial . then\n, unless the curvature was always important in this first period , it is followed by an unknown epoch which connects to the bounce itself , which should also be followed by yet another unknown epoch in order for the curvature to be negligible  @xcite .\nthis reveals the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation , namely the need for a high curvature phase , which we have seen may drastically modify the physical predictions .\nwe wish to thank r.  h.  brandenberger , a.  buonanno , c.  cartier , n.  pinto - neto , n.  turok , j .-\nuzan and f.  vernizzi for helpful comments .\nwe are especially indebted to f.  finelli for many enlightening discussions .\nr.  c.  tolman , phys\n. rev . * 38 * , 1758 ( 1931 ) ;

{"id": "dev_longform_216", "text": "systems biology is an emerging academic field aiming at system - level understanding of biological systems . \n recent progress in molecular biology has enabled us to gain information on the interactions among the underlying molecules from comprehensive experimental data sets . in general , a system - level understanding of a biological system can be derived from insight into four key properties : ( 1 ) the system 's structure , ( 2 ) the system dynamics , ( 3 ) the control method , and ( 4 ) the design method . \n equivalently , identifying related components and their interactions , gathering qualitative and quantitative information about the system 's evolution under different circumstances , achieving the desired outputs by controlling the input with appropriate definitions of inputs and outputs of the system , and reconstructing analogous systems by eliminating the undesired properties are four essential steps in systems biology done by collaboration among engineers , biologists , and doctors . \n systems biology is a cross - cutting research area connecting control engineering , biology , and medical science , as shown in figure 2 . \n it aims at understanding the bare function and integration function of the cell to reconstruct the biological systems with desired features . \n control and automation play critical roles in this novel field not only by providing new technology and equipment for biologists to design and perform meticulous experiments , to take high - throughput measurements , and to analyze experimental data efficiently , but also by offering doctors new medical applications and improving the precision of medical manipulations . \n the wide range of aspects which control and automation have been applied to include , but are not limited to , gene regulation [ 3 , 4 ] , drug delivery [ 2 , 5 ] , and neuron networks [ 6 , 7 ] . the equipment provided by control engineers includes , but is not limited to , nanodevices , biochips , cuvettes for electroporation , and gene guns . \n biologists perform various biological experiments , such as protein synthesis and virus dna modifications , to gather measurements for model revisions and verifications , to conclude theoretical and practical results from evidence , and to help medical practice . \n doctors use both theoretical and practical results from biologists to perform tissue engineering , such as organ transplants and artificial tissue construction . according to their scales \n , biological systems can be divided into three levels : the molecular level ( nm ) , cellular level ( m ) , and tissue level ( cm ) , analogous to the part , individual , and group , respectively . molecular - level research focuses on how , when , where , and to what extent   a gene is expressed . \n the essential goal is to sketch a complete blueprint of genes by identifying the control sequences of coding dna segments and their interactions . \n cellular level research , in general , treats one cell as a plant in classical control theory and investigates the reactions of the cell to the changing environment , for instance , concentration changes of related chemicals . \n state - of - the - art medical therapies are primarily based on experimental results at the cellular level . \n tissue - level research mainly concerns tissue reconstruction , artificial tissue substitutes , or tissue function recovery . \n in contrast , understanding biological systems at the molecular level is crucial , since species have the same basic inheritance , dna macromolecules , and follow a common rule in gene expression , the central dogma in molecular biology . \n molecular level understanding of biological systems provides instrumental information about radical causes of many diseases and the genetic evidence of evolution . \n it also helps biologists to gain a better understanding of molecular level interactions , draw a complete blueprint of gene networks , improve existing means , create novel means to cure genetic diseases , and to elaborate on the theory of evolution . \n recent technology in gene sequencing makes it possible to conquer the difficulty in measurement at the molecular level and to identify the nucleotide sequences of a particular dna segment . \n targeted sequencing is the most promising step toward maximizing the efficiency of the next - generation sequencing technology using polymerase chain reaction . \n the availability of dna microarray makes it possible to accomplish tens of thousands of genetic tests for picomoles ( 10 ) of a specific dna sequence . \n researchers have applied various methods to model , simulate , and control the gene regulation processes . \n early attempts to model and simulate gene regulatory systems are summarized in , including direct graphs , bayesian networks , boolean networks , ordinary and partial different equations , qualitative differential equations , quantative differential equations , stochastic equations , and role - base formalisms . \n other approaches include petri nets , transformational grammars [ 12 , 13 ] , and process algebra . \n three important modeling methods in recent work are gene regulatory units viewed under compound control [ 4 , 1518 ] , logic network models [ 19 , 20 ] , and base - to - base molecular - level formulation [ 21 , 22 ] . \n the first modeling method quantitatively describes chemical concentration variations corresponding to external environmental changes at the cellular level . \n the last modeling converts dna segments to discrete vectors . in our paper , we adapt the base - to - base molecular level formulation to express state variables . \n most existing models are constructed by data - driven or hypothesis - driven methods , with only partial information available . \n due to the complexity of the systems and incomplete information , the mathematical models are usually formulated by modifying empirical equations or proposing heuristic equations . \n although those models can disclose significant details of the system 's structure and dynamics , the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental results creates difficulties for control engineers to verify the models , develop optimal controls , and reconstruct systems with desired properties . in this paper \n , we use a novel approach to build up abstract mathematical models at the molecular level in section 2.2 , based directly on biological theory . with reasonable assumptions \n different from existing methods , focusing on a gene or changes in chemical concentration , we emphasize the base change in the nucleotide bases . \n the cost function , a summation of costs for applying mutagens and the off - trajectory penalty , together with the system equations , formulates the optimal control problem . \n section 3 shows simulation results of the optimal control problem at different scales and is followed by several important propositions . \n the central dogma of molecular biology , first elaborated in   and restated in , illustrates the detailed residue - by - residue transfer of genetic sequential information . nowadays , \n it describes the genetic information flow among three kinds of biopolymers : dna , rna , and protein . in most living organisms , \n this process is usually irreversible , thus protein always acts as the sink of information flow . \n a codon consists of three consecutive nucleotide bases , corresponding to one amino acid according to the genetic codes . \n since there are only 20 kinds of amino acids and 64 combinations of codons , there exists redundancy in genetic codes . \n we are particularly interested in mutations that happen during the process of dna replication , as dna serves as long - term genetic information storage and is the basis of genetic inheritance , the accuracy of which is particularly important to ensure the correct expression of genes . \n dna molecules consist of four kinds of nucleotide acids , adenine ( a ) , thymine ( t ) , guanine ( g ) , and cytosine ( c ) , and a backbone made of sugars and phosphate . in 1953 , \n james d. watson and francis crick found the double helix structure of dna and the rule of basepairing , known as watson - crick basepairing [ 25 , 26 ] . a always pairs with t , g always pairs with c , and vice versa . in nature , \n replication errors occur at a very low rate , one error for every 10 nucleotides added . \n the redundancy of information caused by the double - helix structure ensures the accuracy of dna replication . \n some dna self - repair mechanisms , listed in , such as proofreading , also help to eliminate errors during the replication process . \n point mutations can be further divided into transitions ( ag or ct ) and transversions ( a / gc / t ) . \n transversions are theoretically expected to be twice as frequent as transitions , but transitions may be favored over transversions in coding dna because they usually result in a more conserved polypeptide sequence . in this section , \n we first give the problem statement in section 2.1 , and then we construct system equations for both deterministic and stochastic mutations in section 2.2 . at last , in section 2.3 , we formulate the optimal control problem and apply dynamic programming algorithm to solve it . \n figure 3 shows the system diagram of restoring an abnormal dna segment back to a normal sequence by applying mutagens during the process of dna replication . after we obtain a patient 's genome , we compare the coding dna segments with normal dna segments in our database to figure out the possible range of mutated segments . due to the redundancy in genetic codes , \n as long as any two dna segments can be transcribed and then translated to the same amino acid sequence , the distance reference between them is considered to be zero . \n therefore , instead of having a predetermined final state or a neighborhood of a final state , our final state lies in a set where the distance reference between any sequence in this set and the desired sequence is zero . \n the prescription is then determined by comparing the current measurement and every sequence in the desired set . \n we treat dna sequences as state variables , the on / off controls of all available mutagens at every spot on the given dna segment as inputs , the measurements as the outputs , and one cell cycle as the step increment in our system equations . \n the objective function is defined as a summation of the costs ( including risks ) of applying mutagens and the off - trajectory penalty . \n the optimal control sequences are computed beforehand to let doctors make treatment plans according to the patient 's condition . in general , the optimal control sequence and the corresponding optimal trajectory are not unique because the bases mutate independently in most cases and the order of mutating different bases does not matter if the number of medical treatment sessions is not under a tight restriction . \n additional measurements are taken before and after each treatment , if necessary . in deterministic cases , \n the purpose of taking additional measurements is to check the current sequence and to eliminate both internal and external disturbances . \n in stochastic settings , the measurements are taken to conquer the randomness caused by both mutagens and other noises . \n , our system is a discrete - time dynamic system with finite state space and output space , and a set of on / off switches as controls . \n our goal is to optimally drive this system from a given initial state to a desired final set at the lowest cost . \n we mainly focus on applying chemical mutagens and radiation to restore the original amino acid sequence during the process of dna replication \n . other factors that may affect the gene mutation , including temperature and electroporation , are not within our consideration . \n in addition , we assume that chemical mutagens or radiation target one and only one nucleotide base at any preset site , despite the technical limitation , and the results of applying chemical mutagens and radiation are independent . for simplicity , we normalize the dose of mutagens to transfer one nucleotide base to another in one step to 1 . in most cases , nucleotide bases mutate independently , therefore there is no chain effect caused by mutagens . to avoid reactions among different mutagens , we require that at most one chemical mutagen and one radiation be applied in each cell cycle . while constructing a generalized model , since the order of applying chemical mutagens and radiation does not affect the results , without loss of generality , we require they be applied in the order shown in figure 4 . \n that is , chemical mutagens are always applied before the duplication process starts , radiation is always applied in the middle of the cell cycle , and the measurements are taken before every replication starts . \n lastly , we assume that the measurements are always correct , and dna replication error , background mutation rate , and other random noise can be eliminated from measurements by considering them as spontaneous mutation . \n denote the targeted dna segment with n nucleotide bases at kth step by a column vector x \n k , as shown in figure 5 . \n x \n k \n  is the ith element of x \n k. let p be the transfer matrix from x \n k to x \n k+1 , for all k , k \n { 0 } , without mutation . then , the perfect dna replication process can be expressed as \n proposition 1 \n p = i . \n proofas no mutation occurs , x \n k+1 is completely complementary to x \n k by watson - crick base pairing rule , and x \n k+2 is completely complementary to x \n k+1 . \n therefore , x \n k+2 is exactly the same as x \n k. thus , \n ( 2)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . \n since every base mutates independently , every element of x \n k+1 \n  only depends on the corresponding element of x \n k \n , thus p is diagonal . \n in addition , x \n k+1  x \n k , we conclude p = i . \n  as no mutation occurs , x \n k+1 is completely complementary to x \n k by watson - crick base pairing rule , and x \n k+2 is completely complementary to x \n k+1 . \n therefore , x \n k+2 is exactly the same as x \n k. thus , \n ( 2)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . \n since every base mutates independently , every element of x \n k+1 \n  only depends on the corresponding element of x \n k \n , thus p is diagonal . \n in addition , x \n k+1  x \n k , we conclude p = i . based on proposition 1 , we assign values to nucleotide bases set { a , g , c , t , o } , where o is an artificial nonsense base . \n define an equivalence relationship between { a , g , c , t , o } and { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } , that is , { a , g , c , t , o}{1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } , with \n ( 3)xki={1,if  a,2,if  g,2,if  c,1,if  t,0,if  o. \n \n proposition 2{1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } is a field under proper definitions of addition and multiplication . \n { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } is a field under proper definitions of addition and multiplication . \n proofdefining the addition table and multiplication table as in tables 1 and 2 , we check if the set { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } satisfies the definition of field . \n  defining the addition table and multiplication table as in tables 1 and 2 \n , we check if the set { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } satisfies the definition of field . \n commutativity of addition and multiplicationsatisfied as tables 1 and 2 are symmetric according to the diagonal . \n additive and multiplicative inversesadditive inverses pair : 11 , 22 , 00.multiplicative inverses pair : 11 , 22 , 11 . \n we conclude { 0,1 , 2 , 2 , 1 } is a field under addition and multiplication defined by tables 1 and 2 . from now on , \n we use  to denote the field { 0,1 , 2 , 2 , 1}. and x \n k   \n  is the state vector representing a dna segment with n nucleotide bases , where  \n  is the set of -valued vectors of dimension n.   we start with the simplest form of mutations , point mutation . \n suppose there is a point mutation , we write it mathematically as \n ( 4)xk+1=(i+s)xk+w , \n where x \n k+1 , x \n k   , and i reduces to 1 as only one base is involved . \n the corresponding values of s and w , obtained by reverse engineering with all possible pairs of x \n k and x \n k+1 , are listed in table 3 . here \n , s represents the mutation from four normal nucleotide bases , and w corresponds to mutation from nonsense base , that is , w  0 only if x \n k = 0 . rewriting ( 4 ) by collecting all values of s and w in table 3 , we get \n ( 5a)xk+1=(i+j=04ukjsj)xk+j=04ckjwj \n ( 5b)=(i+uks)xk+ckw , \n where { s \n 0 , s \n 1 , s \n 2 , s \n 3 , s \n 4 } = { w \n 0 , w \n 1 , w \n 2 , w \n 3 , w \n 4 } = { 0,1 , 2 , 2 , 1 } , u \n k \n , c \n k \n   { 0,1 } , representing the on / off controls , u \n k = [ u \n k \n u \n k \n u \n k \n u \n k \n u \n k \n ] , c \n k = [ c \n k \n c \n k \n c \n k \n c \n k \n c \n k \n ] , and s = w = [ 0 1 2  2  1 ] . in ( 5a ) , s \n j and w \n j are constants for all k and j. u \n k \n  and c \n k \n , the inputs of the system , are the on / off controls for chemical mutagens or radiation . \n clearly , j=0 \n c \n k \n  = 1 only if x \n k = 0 . \n equation ( 5b ) is a simplified version of ( 5a ) as we put u \n k \n , s \n j , c \n k \n , w \n j into vector form u \n k , s , c \n k , w. s and w serve as vector basis for base - to - base deterministic model . \n u \n k and c \n k are now multi - input controls ; each of them contains 5 on / off controls , corresponding to all possible transfer patterns . for a particular k , at most one of u \n k \n s and c \n k \n s can be 1 , as stated in proposition 3 . \n this is consistent with the fact that every state can be transferred to only one of the five states in the state space  with corresponding mutagens available . \n proposition 3it is always 1  1 transfer when mutation occurs , that is , one nucleotide base can only transfer to another one , thereforeif x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0,if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and u \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , if x \n k = 0 , then u \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , \n u \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. \n\n  it is always 1  1 transfer when mutation occurs , that is , one nucleotide base can only transfer to another one , thereforeif x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0,if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and u \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , if x \n k = 0 , then u \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , \n u \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. \n  if x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0 , if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and u \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , if x \n k = 0 , then u \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , \n u \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. now , suppose for some reason we need to take an addition , measurement in the middle of the cell cycle , after the completion of the kth duplication and before the start of the ( k + 1)th . \n we name this kind of measurement an intermediate state , and denote by it x \n k. then , we have \n ( 6)xk+1=(i+s )  xk+w , \n where the values of s and w , listed in table 4 , are obtained in the same way as getting s and w in table 3 . comparing tables 3 and 4 \n , we find the collection of s and s , w and w , form the same set , respectively . \n thus , we continue using s and w when rewriting ( 6 ) in the form of ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) , that is , \n ( 7)xk+1=(i+vks)xk+ckw , \n where v \n k , c \n k are the counterparts of u \n k , c \n k , respectively , and s , w are the same as in ( 5b ) . \n similar to proposition 3 , we get proposition 4 . \n proposition 4 \n v \n k and c \n k in ( 7 ) \n need to satisfy the following conditions.if x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0.if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and v \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector.if x \n k = 0 , then v \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n v \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. \n\n \n v \n k and c \n k in ( 7 ) need to satisfy the following conditions.if x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0.if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and v \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector.if x \n k = 0 , then v \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n v \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. \n  if x \n k = 0 and c \n k = 0 , or c \n k = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then x \n k+1 = 0 . \n if x \n k  0 , then c \n k = 0 and v \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector . if x \n k = 0 , then v \n k = 0 and c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n v \n k + c \n k is either 0 or a unit row vector , for all k   \n   { 0}. now take , both chemical mutagens and radiative rays under our consideration and apply them in the order as shown in figure 4 . \n then , we can express our system equation as \n ( 8a)xk=(i+uksmutations  caused  by  chemicalmutagens  from  normal  bases)xk  + ckwmutations  caused  by  chemicalmutagens  from  o , \n ( 8b)xk+1=(i+vksmutations  caused  by  radiativerays  from  normal  bases)xk  + ckwmutations  caused  by  radiativerays  from  o , \n ( 8c )  yk = xk , \n where u \n k and v \n k are the inputs of the system and y \n k is the measurement . \n obviously , ( 8a ) is modified from ( 5b ) and ( 8b ) from ( 7 ) . the two - step mutation and the intermediate state \n x \n k  avoid the case x \n k is changed to different bases by radiation and chemical mutagens simultaneously , which causes confusion . \n substituting ( 8a ) and ( 8b ) , we get \n ( 9a)xk+1=(i+vks)(i+uks)xk+(i+vks)ckw+ckw , \n ( 9b)yk = xk . \n obviously , proposition 3 still holds for u \n k and c \n k , and proposition 4 holds for v \n k and c \n k for ( 9a ) . for point mutations \n , we have 20 on / off controls in total for every step k , 10 for chemical mutagens as described before , and the rest for radiation . in general , \n now , we show how to extend our model to large - scale systems . \n suppose we have a coding dna segment with length n , then x \n k   \n . since a coding dna segment usually contains integer number of codons , which is made of three consecutive bases , n is a multiple of 3 . \n let x \n k \n  denote the ith component of x \n k. this notation is consistent with the one in section 2.2.1 . \n initiated by the base - to - base deterministic model from section 2.2.1 , we write our system equation for large - scale system as \n ( 10 )  xk=(i+i=1nukiskimutations  caused  by  chemicalmutagens  from  normal  bases)xk  + ikckiwkimutations  caused  by  chemicalmutagens  from  o , xk+1=(i+i=1nvkiqkimutations  caused  by  radiative  raysfrom  normal  bases)xk  + ikbkirkimutations  caused  by  radiativerays  from  o ,  yk = xk , \n where u \n k \n , v \n k \n , c \n k \n , b \n k \n  are on / off controls of the ith element ,  s \n k \n , q \n k \n  are n  n square matrices corresponding to the mutations between normal bases or from normal bases by chemicals and radiation , respectively , w \n k \n , r \n k \n  are n - dimensional column vectors representing mutations from nonsense bases by chemicals and radiation , respectively , and  \n k = { i : x \n k \n  = 0,1 \n i  n } ,  \n k = { i : x \n k \n  = 0,1  i  n}. \n s \n k \n  and q \n k \n  are diagonal matrices since each base mutates independently . \n the values in the first four rows of tables 3 and 4 correspond to the diagonal elements of s \n k \n  and q \n k \n , respectively . \n the last rows of tables 3 and 4 are assigned to w \n k \n  and r \n k \n , n - dimensional vectors , at nonsense base 's spots for x \n k. define  = { s \n j \n e \n i \n e \n i \n , i , j , 0  j  4,1  i  n } , a collection of n \n n matrices , where s \n j is the same as in ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) , e \n i is the unit column vector of length n with ith component equal to 1 and all other components equal to 0 , and e \n i \n e \n i \n  is the square matrix with only the ith element on the diagonal equals to 1 , and 0 otherwise . \n then , s \n k \n , q \n k \n  can be written as linear combinations of all elements from  , with the coefficient of each element either 0 or 1 corresponding to the on / off control u \n k \n  and v \n k \n , respectively . \n similarly , define  = { w \n j \n e \n i , i , j , 0  j  4,1  i  n } , where w \n j is the same as ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) . \n w \n k \n , r \n k \n  can be written as linear combinations of all components from  , with coefficient of every component either 0 or 1 corresponding to the on / off control c \n k \n  and c \n k \n , respectively . \n therefore , instead of using step - varying s \n k \n , s \n k \n , w \n k \n , r \n k \n , we find matrix basis for those four square matrices to make the controls to be the only variables depending on k , as we did for single - base cases . \n then , we can , write ( 10 ) as \n ( 11a)xk=(i+i=1n  j=04uk(i , j)sjeieit)xk+ik  j=04ck(i , j)wjei , \n ( 11b)xk+1=(i+i=1n  j=04vk(i , j)sjeieit)xk+ik  j=04ck(i , j)wjei , \n ( 11c)yk = xk , \n where u \n k \n , v \n k \n , c \n k \n , c \n k \n   { 0,1}. as shown in ( 11a ) , ( 11b ) , and ( 11c ) , multisites mutations contain 20n controls in total for every step k , where n is the number of nucleotide bases on the targeted gene . \n similar to point mutations , every single site has 20 controls in each step , 10 for chemical mutagens and 10 for radiation . we can view u \n k , v \n k , c \n k , \n c \n k as binary matrices of dimension n  5 , and u \n k \n , v \n k \n c \n k \n , c \n k \n are the corresponding element of ith row and jth column . \n use u \n k \n , v \n k \n , c \n k \n , b \n k \n , binary row vectors of dimension 5 , to denote the ith row of u \n k , v \n k , c \n k , c \n k , respectively . \n again , s = w = [ 0 1 2  2  1 ] . combining ( 11a ) and ( 11b ) , and writing control variables in vector forms , we get \n ( 12)xk+1=(i+i=1nvkiseieit)(i+i=1nukiseieit)xk  + ( i+i=1nvkiseieit)ikckiwei+ikbkiwei , yk = xk . \n \n proposition 5for large - scale deterministic system , u \n k , v \n k , c \n k , c \n k satisfy conditions below.if \n e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , then i   \n k.if e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , c \n k \n  = 0 or c \n k \n  = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then i   \n k.for all i   \n k , u \n k \n  is either 0 or a row

k \n  is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n\n  for large - scale deterministic system , \n u \n k , v \n k , c \n k , c \n k satisfy conditions below.if \n e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , then i   \n k.if \n e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , c \n k \n  = 0 or c \n k \n  = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then i   \n k.for all i   \n k , u \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and c \n k \n  = 0.for all i   \n k , c \n k \n  is either 0 a row unit vector and u \n k \n  = 0.for all i   \n k , v \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and b \n k \n  = 0.for all i   \n k , b \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and v \n k \n  = 0.for all i , k , 1  i \n n , k   \n   { 0 } , u \n k \n  + \n c \n k \n  is either 0 or a unit row vector and v \n k \n  + b \n k \n  is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n  if e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , then i   \n k. if e \n i \n x \n k = 0 , c \n k \n  = 0 or c \n k \n  = [ 1 0 0 0 0 ] , then i   \n k. for all i   \n k , u \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and c \n k \n  = 0 . for all i   \n k , c \n k \n  is either 0 a row unit vector and u \n k \n  = 0 . for all i \n k , v \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and b \n k \n  = 0 . \n for all i   \n k , b \n k \n  is either 0 or a row unit vector and v \n k \n  = 0 . for all i , k , \n 1  i  n , k   \n   { 0 } , u \n k \n  + \n c \n k \n  is either 0 or a unit row vector and v \n k \n  + b \n k \n  is either 0 or a unit row vector . \n the mathematical model ( 12 ) is quite flexible and can be easily extended to many cases , such as transcription process , multiple spot mutations within one - step or broken dna strands . \n our system equation can represent this phenomenon by dividing the whole system into small subsystems . \n significant brokage of dna strands is simply eliminated by cell mechanism to ensure the accuracy to dna replication . \n equation ( 13 ) shows the case of one single dna strand breaking into two segments by chemical mutagens  \n ( 13)(xk(1)xk(2))=(im+i=1mukiseieit00inm+i = m+1nukiseieit )  (xk(1)xk(2))+  ( ik,1imckiweiik ,  ( m+1)inckiwei),xk+1(1)=(im+i=1mvkiseieit)xk(1)+ik ,  1imbkiwei , xk+1(2)=(inm+i = m+1nvkiseieit)xk(2 )  + ik ,  ( m+1)inbkiwei . \n  in reality , \n therefore , we need to derive the model for gene - to - gene stochastic mutations \n . introduce new random variables , h \n k , l1 \n , r \n k , l2 \n , h \n k , l3 \n , r \n k , l4 \n   { 0,1 } , associated with probability p \n l1,j \n , p \n l2,j \n , p \n l3,j \n , p \n l4,j \n , for all i , k , 1  i \n n , k   \n   { 0 } , respectively , where k is the step index , l \n 1 , l \n 2 are indices for chemical mutagens inducing mutation from normal bases and from o , respectively , l \n 3 , l \n 4 are indices for radiation inducing mutation from normal bases and from o , respectively , i is the index of dna segment , and the value of j corresponds to the transfer pattern , which can be found in tables 3 and 4 . \n note different mutagens have different probability assignments , the probability assignments are only related to the type of mutagens , and the probability associated with every kind of mutagens sums up to 1 , that is , \n ( 14)j=04pl1,j(h)=1 ,  l1 ,  1l1l,j=04pl2,j(r)=1 ,  l2 ,  1l2m,j=04pl3,j(h)=1 ,  l3 ,  1l3l,j=04pl4,j(r)=1 ,  l4 ,  1l4m. \n the controls are u \n k , l1 \n , c \n k , l2 \n , v \n k , l3 \n , b \n k , l4 \n   { 0,1 } , with the fact that 1 representing mutagen with corresponding index is applied at ith spot of dna segment at kth generation , and 0 representing mutagen with corresponding index is not applied at spot i at kth step , similar to sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 . \n the mutagen indices l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 can be omitted in deterministic mutations since given the current state and control , the next state is unique . however , they are necessary for stochastic mutations , because there exist multiple possible states for the next stage given the control . in other words , \n the next state is determined by random variables h \n k , l1 \n , r \n k , l2 \n , h \n k , l3 \n , r \n k , l4 \n , given the values of u \n k , l1 \n , c \n k , l2 \n , v \n k , l3 \n , b \n k , l4 \n , and x \n k. suppose we have ( l + m ) kinds of chemical mutagens available , with l kinds to induce mutations from normal bases and m kinds to induce mutations from o. and we have ( l + m ) kinds of radiation available , with l kinds to induce mutations from normal bases and m kinds to induce mutations from o. therefore , we have total ( l + m + l + m ) controls for each spot i at each step k. we can write our system equation as \n ( 15a)xk=(i+l1=1l  i=1nuk , l1ij=04hk , l1(i , j)sjeieitmutations  caused  by  chemical  mutagens  from  normal  bases)xk  + l2=1 m  ikck , l2ij=04rk , l2(i , j)wjeimutations

l4(i , j)wjeimutations  caused  by  radiative  rays  from  o , \n ( 15c )  yk = xk . \n again , we define h \n k , l1 \n , r \n k , l2 \n , h \n k , l3 \n , r \n k , l4 \n  the elements at ith row and jth column of n  5 binary matrices h \n k , l1 , r \n k , l2 , h \n k , l3 , r \n k , l4 , respectively . \n h \n k , l1 \n , r \n k , l2 \n , h \n k , l3 \n , r \n k , l4 \n , and binary row vectors of dimension 5 denote the ith row of h \n k , l1 , r \n k , l2 , h \n k , l3 , r \n k , l4 , respectively \n . then , we can simplify ( 15a ) , ( 15b ) , and ( 15c ) and combine ( 15a ) and ( 15b ) as

dna replication systems with system equations proposed as ( 9a ) , ( 9b ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 16 ) are completely controllable if and only if for all x \n 0 , x \n 2k1 , x \n 2k2 + 1   , k \n 1 , k \n 2   \n   { 0 } ,  at least one path from x \n 0 to x \n 2k1 and at least one path from x \n 0 to x \n 2k2 + 1 by applying proper mutagens in the correct order , with k \n 1 , k \n 2 finite . \n we first define our objective function that can be adapted to all kinds of systems proposed in section 2.2 with minor changes . \n mathematically , in systems where the controllable parameters of interest are discrete , the objective function is usually a weighted sum representing the number of times that a piece of equipment is turned  on  or  off  or the number of resources needed to execute certain tasks in the frequent cases . in our case \n , this summation is the total number of times that different mutagens are applied weighted by the corresponding cost ( including the risk ) . \n another key factor of objective function is the off - trajectory penalty . designing a trajectory \n if the measurement indicates that the current state is off the predefined trajectory , we include a distance reference between current state and desired state as penalty and change the treatment plan accordingly . \n therefore , our objective function can be expressed as \n ( 17)j0(x0)=minu , c , v , c  h , h,r , r[k=0n1l1=1li=1nl1uk , l1i+k=0n1l2=1mi=1nl2ck , l2icost  of  applying  chemical  mutagens  +  k=0n1l3=1li=1nl3vk , l3i+k=0n1l4=1mi=1nl4bk , l4icost  of  applying  radiative  rays  +

l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 is the same as in section 2.2.3 . \n l1 ,  \n l2 ,  \n l3 ,  \n l4   , for all  l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 , 1  l \n 1 \n 1  l \n 2  m , 1  l \n 3  l , 1  l \n 4  m , are the corresponding cost of applying chemical mutagens and radiative rays indexed l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 , respectively . \n { x \n k \n } :  \n    \n     { 0 } denotes the desired set at kth stage , generated by the dna sequences representing the same amino acid sequence as  x \n k \n , the desired state at kth step . and d(x \n k , { x \n k \n } ) is the distance reference of the current state x \n k to the desired set { x \n k \n } at kth step . \n the final penalty , the distance reference from the final state to the desired set at k = n , is included in the last term . in general ,  \n l2 ,  \n l4   \n l1 ,  \n l3 , for all l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 , 1  l \n 1 \n l , 1  l \n 2  m , 1  l \n 3  l , \n 1  l \n 4  m , because physically o is a set of nonsense bases and more details are necessary to convert an o back to normal bases , for instance , the cost to identify the exact element in the set o. our goal is to drive our system optimally from initial state x \n 0 to the desired final set { x \n n \n } by applying a sequence of mutagens indexed with { l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 } , at problematic positions i , and in a correct order k. in ( 17 ) , the first four terms inside the expectation do not depend on random variables h \n k , l1 \n , r \n k , l2 \n , h \n k , l3 \n , and r \n k , l4 \n , for all i , k , l \n 1 , l \n 2 , l \n 3 , l \n 4 as the treatment plan is computed based on the initial state x \n 0 . given y \n k , \n the last term inside expectation , k=0 \n d(x \n k , { x \n k \n } ) , is the only term in summation that depends on the distribution of the random variables . \n the constraint of the optimal control problem , in general , is the system equation . \n we choose multidimensional stochastic system equation as the generalized constraints as it can be degenerated to one - dimensional and multidimensional deterministic cases by proper modifications . \n therefore , we can rewrite our objective function and formulate our optimal control problem as \n ( 18)j0(x0)=min{u , c , v , c}0,1,  ,n1[k=0n1l1=1li=1nl1uk , l1i+k=0n1l2=1mi=1nl2ck , l2i  +  k=0n1l3=1li=1nl3vk , l3i+k=0n1l4=1mi=1nl4bk , l4i  +  k=0n{h , r , h,r}0,1,  ,n1[d(xk,{xkd } ) ] ] , \n subject to \n ( 19)xk+1=(i+l3=1li=1nvk , l3ihk , l3iseieit )  (i+l1=1li=1nuk , l1ihk , l1iseieit)xk  + ( i+l3=1li=1nvk , l3ihk , l3iseieit)l2=1mikck , l2irk , l2iwei  +  l4=1mikbk , l4irk , l4iwei , yk = xk . \n we need to choose a proper distance reference to quantitatively describe the relationship between dna segments of same length . \n we first define the distance reference between codons , and the distance reference between dna segments is a weighted sum of distance reference between every pair of codons . \n the distance reference between codons , d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) ,  \n 1 ,  \n 2   \n , needs to fulfill the biological requirements as below . \n mathematically , d :  \n    \n     { 0 } , d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 )  0 . \n symmetry : the distance reference from codon  \n 1 to codon  \n 2 equals the distance reference from codon  \n 2 to codon  \n 1 , that is , d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) = d( \n 2 ,  \n 1 ) . \n the distance reference between two codons corresponding to different amino acids should reveal the chemical and physical differences between two amino acids . \n the distance reference from stop codons to all other codons is much larger than those between other codons as early termination of amino acid sequences is more harmful than other forms of mutations . \n all the existing metric defined on the finite field can not achieve all the requirements above . \n the second requirement violates the identity of indiscernible , that is , d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) = 0 if and only if  \n 1 =  \n 2 . \n the redundancy in genetic codes implies d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) = 0 if those two amino acids ,  \n 1 and  \n 2 , are translated into the same amino acids . \n in addition , the triangular inequality is not necessarily true , according to the underlying physical meanings . \n we take the assumption that the stop codons are of the same distance reference from and to all other codons . \n we ignore codons containing o since their chemical and physical properties can not be found in literature . from table 5 , we can see all codons are divided into different sets with each set corresponding to one amino acid . the size and \n this implies that the costs of driving one codon to the desired final set generated by the desired final state might be different from the costs of driving the complementary codon to the desired final set generated by the complementary of desired final state . \n more discussions about this issue are presented in section 3 . the distance reference between any two codons \n can be defined by a weighted sum of the differences between physical and chemical properties or other reasonable functions . and \n the distance reference between two dna sequences is defined as the sum of distance reference between the corresponding pair of codons . \n an example of the distance function can be expressed as \n ( 20)d(1,2)=polarity  polarity(1,2 )  + ph  ph(1,2)+size  size(1,2),polarity(1,2 )  = { 0if  1,2  are  both  polar  or  non - polar,1if  one  of  1,2  is  polar , and  the  other  non - polar , ph(1,2 )  = |ph  value  of  1ph  value  of  2|,size(1,2 )  = { 0,if  1,2  are  both  tiny , small , or  normal,1,if  one  of  1,2  is  tiny , and  the  other  small,2,if  one  of  1,2  is  tiny , and  the  other  normal,3,if  one  of  1,2  is  small , and  the  other  normal , \n where  \n 1 ,  \n 2 are two amino acids . \n d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) is then assigned to d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) with  \n 1 ,  \n 2 corresponding to amino acids  \n 1 ,  \n 2 , respectively . since the generalized optimal control problem in ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) is a multistage problem that can be broken down into simpler steps at different time points . \n for dynamic programming , the optimal control policy is constructed backward . and bellman 's principle of optimality states that the optimal policy for x \n 0 to { x \n n \n } is also the optimal policy for the tail problem , from x \n q to { x \n n \n } . \n the tail problem is defined as \n ( 21)jq(xq)=min{u , c , v , c}q , q+1, \n ,n1{k = qn1l1=1li=1nl1uk , l1i+k = qn1l2=1mi=1nl2ck , l2i  +  k = qn1l3=1li=1nl3vk , l3i+k = qn1l4=1mi=1nl4bk , l4i  +  k = qn{h , r , h,r}q , q+1,  ,n1[d(xk,{xkd})]}. \n the iterative update equation to find optimal policy can be expressed by ( 22 ) , according to the dynamic programming algorithm in . \n ( 22)jn(xn)=d(xn,{xnd}),jq(xq)=minuq , cq , vq , cq  hq , rq , hq,rq[l1=1li=1nl1uq , l1i+l2=1mi=1nl2cq , l2i+l3=1li=1nl3vq , l3i  +  l4=1mi=1nl4cq , l4i+d(xq,{xqd})+jq+1(xq+1)]=minuq , cq , vq ,

applying chemical mutagens only because the randomness of applying radiation is much larger and more difficult to control . we also omit the mutations between a normal base and o because of high - cost  \n l2 and the unavailable chemical and physical properties for codons containing o. the distance reference between codons used in sections 3.2 and 3.3 is computed by ( 20 ) with  \n polarity = 8 ,  \n ph = 3 ,  \n size = 1 ,  \n 1 = 2 ,  \n 2 = 5 and  \n 3 = 3 . \n we only keep the final penalty but omit the off - trajectory penalty along the trajectory . \n we define the distance reference between bases as \n ( 23)d(1,2)={0,if  xn = xnd,,if  xnxnd , \n with  \n 1 ,  \n 2   \n {0 } , where  \n {0 } denotes the set  excluding the element 0 . \n our optimal control problem for point mutations is \n ( 24)j0(x0)=minuk , l1 ,  0kn ,  1l1l{k=0n1  l1=1ll1uk , l1 } , \n subject to \n ( 25)xk+1=(i+l1=1luk , l1s)xk , xn = xnd , \n with x \n 0 given , x \n k \n {0}. suppose that there are 12 kinds of mutagens ( l \n 1 = 12 ) , each corresponding to a specific transfer pattern as in table 6 , all available controls and the respective costs can be immediately listed as in tables 7 and 8 . \n the elements along the antidiagonal of table 7 , u \n at , u \n gc , u \n cg , and u \n ta , are artificially added , because the complementary transfers naturally happen and no mutagen is necessary . \n thus , the costs along the antidiagonal of table 8 are all zero , that is ,  \n at =  \n gc =  \n cg =  \n tc = 0 . the equivalence relationship between subscription in two nucleotide bases and subscription in integer l \n 1( \n 1 \n 2 ) : { a , t , g , c }  { a , t , g , c }  { integers  from  1  to  12 } is defined by table 6 .   under the above assumptions , we can write update equation for optimal policy explicitly as \n ( 26)jq(xq)=minuq , l1{xq+jq+1(),{a , t , g , c}{0}}. \n \n proposition 7for the same x \n n \n ,  jq()jq+1( ) , for all q , 0  q  n  1 , for all   { a , t

\n q( ) = j \n m( ) if m  q  0  ( mod 2 ) . in our example , \n proofthis first part is due to the zero cost for the transfers between complementary bases in the consecutive steps . for any 0  q  n  1 \n , the relationship between minimal costs in consecutive steps is shown in ( 26 ) . since   { a , \n t , g , c } , +jq+1( ) is one of the four elements in the set from which the j \n q( ) is picked . \n moreover , =0 . therefore , jq+1( ) is one of the four elements in the set . since j \n q( ) is the minimum picking for a set containing jq+1( ) , \n we conclude that jq()jq+1().the m value in our example is proved by brute force method , that is , j \n n6( ) is a guaranteed global minimum . for completely controllable systems \n the existence of m implies that for without limitation in the number of steps , we can reach the global optimal in n  m steps , 6 steps in our example.suppose that q = m , j \n m( ) is the global minimum , thus jm-1()jm( ) . \n jm-1( ) is also a global minimum.by backward induction , suppose for q = q \n 1 , the statement is true , that is , jq1 - 1()=jq1( ) is the global optimal either from xq1 - 1= or x \n q1 =  to x \n n \n . \n obviously , for q = q \n 1  1 , the statement is still true . \n therefore , jq()=jq-2()=jq-1( ) ,  {a , t , g , c } , for all q , 2  q  m. \n  this first part is due to the zero cost for the transfers between complementary bases in the consecutive steps . \n for any 0  q  n  1 , the relationship between minimal costs in consecutive steps is shown in ( 26 ) . since   { a , \n t , g , c } , +jq+1( ) is one of the four elements in the set from which the j \n q( ) is picked . \n since j \n q( ) is the minimum picking for a set containing jq+1( ) , we conclude that jq()jq+1( ) . \n the m value in our example is proved by brute force method , that is , j \n n6( ) is a guaranteed global minimum . for completely controllable systems , this m always exists . \n the existence of m implies that for without limitation in the number of steps , we can reach the global optimal in n  m steps , 6 steps in our example . \n suppose that q = m , j \n m( ) is the global minimum , thus jm-1()jm( ) . \n suppose for q = q \n 1 , the statement is true , that is , jq1 - 1()=jq1( ) is the global optimal either from xq1 - 1= or x \n q1 =  to x \n n \n . obviously , for q = q \n 1  1 , the statement is still true . \n therefore , jq()=jq-2()=jq-1( ) ,  {a , t , g , c } , for all q , 2  q  m. in the proof of global minimum that can be reached in the finite step in proposition 7 , we also discover proposition 8 . here , j \n q(x \n q , x \n n \n ) denotes the optimal cost from x \n q to x \n n \n . \n proposition 8given two single base mutation optimal control problems , with the same fixed n , with and desired final states complementary to each other . if j \n m( , x \n n \n ) is the global minimum , then jm(,xnd ) is also the global minimum , that is , the global minimum of both systems is reach at the same stage m. moreover , for all q , 0  q  m , \n ( 27)jq(,xnd)=jq(,xnd ) ,  ,xnd{a , t , g , c}. \n\n  given two single base mutation optimal control problems , with the same fixed n ,

is reach at the same stage m. moreover , for all q , 0  q  m , \n ( 27)jq(,xnd)=jq(,xnd ) ,  ,xnd{a , t , g , c}. \n \n physically , proposition 8 states that the optimal can be achieve at the same step from a pair of complementary bases to another pair of complementary bases at the same cost . however \n , this fact is true only for base - to - base deterministic mutations , because the distance reference is well defined by ( 23 ) . \n since we apply mutagens before the replication starts , u \n aa actually transfer a to t and then to a by replication . for simplicity \n , we just use the kth and ( k + 1)th step states as subscripts to represent the corresponding control and cost . \n therefore ,  \n ac ,  \n ca ,  \n gt ,  \n tg is smaller than other mutagens , except artificial ones . if we use  to denote the costs of mutagens as listed in table 9 , then  \n (

represent a , 2 to g , 3 to c , and 4 to t in graphical interpretation . from figure 6 \n , we can see clearly that the optimal cost decreases as q decreases in the first few steps , and then optimal cost remains at the global minimum . \n this phenomenon obeys proposition 7 . in this example , global optimal is reached at m = 5 for all pairs of initial and final states as j \n 7  j \n 5 = j \n 3 and j \n 6  j \n 4 = j \n 2 . \n so , the global minimum is achieved before we reach n  5 = 4 in this particular case . \n this also implies that with n free we can reach desired final state in 4 steps from given initial state . observing closely to j \n q , 0  q  5 , \n j \n q1 equals to j \n q by exchanging the first and the last columns , and the second and the third columns , which is consistent with proposition 8 . \n or we can exchange the first and the last rows , and the second and the third rows of j \n q to obtain j \n q1 . \n j \n q1 and j \n q2 are the same for q \n 1 , q \n 2  m = 5 for q \n 1  q \n 2 = 0 ( mod 2 ) . \n the optimal trajectories are generated from p \n q(x \n q , x \n n \n ) . \n for example , given x \n 2 = t , and the final state x \n 9 \n  = g , we want to generate the optimal trajectories . \n x \n 3 = p \n 2(t , g ) = a , g.   if x \n 3 = a , x \n 4 = p \n 3(a , g ) = t ; if x \n 3 = g , x \n 4 = p \n 3(a , g ) = c. if x \n 4 = t , x \n 5 = p \n 4(t , g ) = a , g ; if x \n 4 = c , x \n 5 = p \n 4(c , g ) = g. if x \n 5 = a , x \n 6 = p \n 5(a , g ) = t ; if x \n 5 = g , x \n 6 = p \n 5(g , g ) = c.   if x \n 6 = t , x \n 7 = p \n 6(t , g ) = a , g ; if x \n 6 = c , x \n 7 = p \n 6(c , g ) = g. if x \n 7 = a , \n x \n 8 = p \n 7(a , g ) = t ; if x \n 7 = g , x \n 8 = p \n 7(g , g ) = c. so , the optimal routes are \n tatatattgutgg ; \n tatattgutggcg ; \n tattgutggcgcg ; \n ttgutggcgcgcg .  \n consequently , the optimal cost is j \n 2(t , g ) = 0.64 =  \n tg . \n optimal trajectories for other pairs of initial and final states can be obtained in the same manner . \n it takes less than 1 second to generate optimal trajectories for all pairs of initial and final states with n = 9 on a regular desktop . \n since we have already proven by the brute force method that the global optimal can be achieved with m  6 , the computation time can be further reduced by taking n = 6 with all the results necessary for this example . for codon - to - codon deterministic mutations , \n we formulate our optimal control problem as \n ( 33)j0(x0)=minuk , l1i ,  0kn,1l1l ,  1i3{k=0n1l1=1li=13l1uk , l1i+d(xn,{xnd } )  } , \n subject to \n ( 34)xk+1=(i+l1=1li=13uk , l1iseieit)xk , \n with x \n 0 , x \n n \n    \n {0 } \n  given , x \n k   \n {0 } \n , for all k , 0  k  n , and d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) ,  \n 1 ,  \n 2   \n {0 } \n  as defined in section 2.3 . \n if we take the same assumption on available mutagens as in section 3.1 , then we can write update equation for optimal control policy explicitly as \n ( 35)jq(xq)=minuq , l1i ,  1l1l ,  1i3{xq11+jq+1([1xq2xq3 ] ) ,  xq22+jq+1([xq12xq3]),xq33+jq+1([xq1xq23 ] ) ,  1,2,3{a , t , g , c}{0 } } , \n with x \n q \n   { a , t , g , c} \n {0 } , 1  i  3 denotes the ith element of x \n q   \n {0 } \n , and xqi denotes the complementary base of x \n q \n . \n the optimal control sequences depend on the numerical values of  \n l1s and d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) ,  \n 1 ,  \n 2   \n {0 } \n . though we do not have real values of  \n l1s and d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) \n , we can always obtain simulation results to compare the result differences by assigning different numerical values to those parameters . \n therefore , we use three different assignments of  \n l1s and the same d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) to generate our simulation results . those three assignments of  \n l1s are  , 5 , and 0.5 , respectively , with  the same as assigned in section 3.1 . \n in every particular example , it takes approximately 2 seconds on a regular desktop to generate the optimal path table for all pairs of initial and final states with n = 19 , and the dynamic programming algorithm ensures that the optimal control for tail problems is generated at the same time . \n the graphical interpretation of three assignments are shown in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 , respectively . \n the x - axis and y - axis denote x \n q and x \n n \n , respectively . for a codon [  \n 1   \n 2   \n 3 ] ,  \n 1 ,  \n 2 ,  \n 3  { a , t , g , c} \n {0 } , its index is calculated by \n ( 36)42(11)+4(21)+3,where  \n i = 1 if a ,  \n i = 2 if g ,  \n i = 3 if c , and  \n i = 4 if t , 1  i  3 , for the simplicity of graphical interpretation . \n thus , there are 64 pairs of initial and final desired states , and there are 64  21 pairs of initial state and final desired set . \n j \n q is calculated following the same procedure as in base - to - base deterministic cases . the value of optimal cost can be read directly from graphical interpretation , and the optimal path can be generated from path matrix p \n q , similar to base - to - base deterministic case . both j \n q and p \n q , for  all \n q ,  0  q  n , are of 64  64 dimension . from the graphical interpretation and table 10 , we find that the value of q where the global minimum is reached at the first time decreases as  \n l1 decreases . \n and j \n 0 is more similar to j \n 18 with  = 5 than with  =  or  = 0.5. this implies that if d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) are the deterministic term in our objective function , then the treatment plan is made to drive the final state as close to the desired set as possible ; if the costs of applying mutagens is the deterministic term in the objective function , then the treatment plan tends to stay in the original state and applies less mutagens ; if they are of equal weight , then the treatment plan deals with this tradeoff . \n moreover , no matter how the numerical values of final penalty and the costs of applying mutagens changes in our objective function as shown in ( 33 ) , there is always a m , m  n  18 , j \n m(x \n m ) is global minimum . \n proposition 7 can be extended to codon - to - codon deterministic mutations as stated in proposition 9 . \n proposition 9given an optimal control

rest is similar to the proof of proposition 7 . \n the objective function in ( 33 ) can be written as the summation of three separate single - base mutation systems and the distance reference between

guaranteed global optimal . indeed , \n the m value where the first global optimal is reached at earlier stage as listed in table 10 . \n graphically , the indices of complementary codons  \n 1 = [  \n 1   \n 2   \n 3 ] and 2=[1    2  3]t sum up to 65 , that is ,  \n ( 38 )  ( 16(11)+4(21)+3 )  + ( 16(11)+4(21)+3 )  = ( 16(11)+4(21)+3 )  + ( 16((51)1)+4((52)1)+(53 ) )  = 65 . \n \n therefore , j \n q and j \n q1 , 1  q  m are symmetric about the plane x = 32.5 , j \n q2 and j \n q , 2  q  m are the same , as shown in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 \n . however , proposition 8 can not be extended to codon - to - codon deterministic case due to the redundancy of genetic codes , that is , the set of codons translated to the same amino acid varies from one amino acid to another as shown in table 5 . \n the simulation results show that the costs , a pair of complementary codons , to two final desired set generated by a pair of complementary final desired codons are different , that is , jq(xq,{xnd})jq(xq,{xnd } ) , in general , for any q. graphically , the optimal cost profile j \n q is not symmetric about the plane y = 32.5 for j \n q1 , 1  q  m. therefore , the doctors need to pick the strand with lower cost to make the treatment plan . \n this also implies that in large - scale cases , for instance , a gene containing hundreds of nucleotide bases , the doctors should make the treatment plan based on the strand the total cost of which is lower than the other . \n the optimal control problem of codon - to - codon stochastic mutations can be written as \n ( 39)j0(x0)=minuk , l1i ,  0kn11l1l ,  1i3{k=0n1l1=1li=13l1uk , l1i  + hk , l1i ,  0kn11l1l ,  1i3[d(xn,{xnd } ) ] } , \n subject to \n ( 40)xk+1=ixk+l1=1li=13uk , l1ihk , l1iseieitxk , \n with x \n 0 , x \n n \n    \n {0 } \n  given , x \n k \n the major difference between deterministic and stochastic systems is that we impose the random binary vector , h \n k , l1 \n , in our system equation ( 40 ) . \n we denote the probability associated with h \n k , l1 \n  to be p \n l1,12 \n  with  \n 1 ,  \n 2  { a , t , g , c}. the equivalence relationship between j and  \n 1 \n  \n 2 can be found in table 3 . \n again , we assume that we have l \n 1 = 12 kinds of mutagens , each corresponding to one major transfer pattern , associated with probability assignments , as listed in table 11 . \n then , we can write updated formula for optimal control policy explicitly as \n ( 41)jq(xq)=minuq , l1i ,  1l1l ,  1i3{xq11+hq , l1(xq11)1[jq+1([xq2xq3 ] ) ] ,  xq22+hq , l1(xq22)2[jq+1([xq1xq3 ] ) ] ,  xq33+hq , l1(xq33)3[jq+1([xq1xq2 ] ) ] ,  1,2,3{a , t , g , c}{0 } } \n where \n ( 42)hq , l1(xq11)1[jq+1([xq2xq3])]=pl1(xq11 ) ,  xq1a(h)[jq+1([axq2xq3 ] ) ]  + pl1(xq11 ) ,  xq1g(h)[jq+1([gxq2xq3 ] ) ]  +

{0 } \n , xqi denotes the complementary base of x \n q \n , and l \n 1 :  \n 1 \n  \n 2  { a , t , g , c }  { a , t , g , c }  { integers  from  1  to  12 } , the mapping from major transfer pattern  \n 1   \n 2 to mutagen index , as shown in table 11 . \n the mathematical expression of hq , l1(xq22)2[jq+1([xq1    xq3]t ) ] and hq , l1(xq33)3[jq+1([xq1xq2]t ) ] is similar to hq , \n l1(xq11)1[jq+1([  xq2  xq3]t ) ] as shown above . in order to run the simulation , \n we assign numerical values to probabilities in table 11 , as illustrated in table 12 .   as in section 3.2 , we use three different assignments for  \n l1s ,  , 5 , and 0.5 , respectively . the optimal cost profile j \n q with selected q values , for every pair of ( x \n q , x \n n \n ) \n , is graphically interpreted in figures 10 , 11 , and 12 , respectively , with n = 29 , with computation time of approximately 7 seconds on a regular desktop . \n the profile of j \n 0 is more similar to j \n 29 when  \n l1s are assigned 5 than  or 0.5. this implies in codon - to - codon stochastic mutations ; the optimal control sequence behaves as codon - to - codon deterministic cases , that is , the system tends to getting as close as possible to the final desired set if  \n l1s are much smaller than d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) , and the system tends to remain in the same state with minor mutations when  \n l1s are relatively larger than d( \n 1 ,  \n 2 ) ,  \n 1 ,  \n 2   \n {0 } \n . and jq()jq+1( ) ,    \n {0 } \n  is still valid in codon - to - codon stochastic case . \n however , for stochastic cases , we can not reach a global minimum because of the randomness caused by mutagens . since , in usual cases , there exists no stationary global minimum \n , we need to define error tolerance  , that is , if |jq()-jq-1()| with the same { x \n n \n } , then we can stop at j \n q(x \n q ) . \n however , we can still observe figures 10 , 11 , and 12 to conclude that j \n 0 and j \n 2 are almost of the same shape in all three different parameter assignments . \n higher dimensional optimal control problems , gene - to - gene stochastic mutations , can be solved as a series of cascade codon - to - codon stochastic problems . \n in this paper , we present a mathematical model to deal with mutations in the process of dna replication in the view of control systems . different from the existing models , our model is constructed directly from the basic biological theories , the central dogma in molecular biology , and the complementary base pair for dna molecules with double helix structure . \n it precisely describes how the induced mutations affect the targeted dna segments at molecular level . \n it provides instrumental information of molecule interactions in gene mutation for biologists and doctors to gain a better understanding of cellular and tissue level systems ' behavior . \n though we emphasize that we target at induced mutations during the process of dna replication in our work , this model can be extended to other biological processes at molecular level , such as transcription process and dna brokage . in our optimal control problem , \n the objective function includes two factors : the risk / cost of applying mutagens and the off - trajectory penalty . under optimal control policy , \n the summation of those two factors are minimized , by dynamic programming , to propose a low - risk treatment plan . \n we define the distance reference following the chemical and physical properties of amino acids , representing the penalty . \n our objective is to drive the system from given initial state to the final desired set generated by the final desired state at the lowest cost . \n we define the final desired set since redundancy in genetic codes gives us additional options of final desired state to further lower the cost . \n we also discuss three different small - scale system , and show the simulation results of examples . \n the optimal control problems of base - to - base deterministic mutations and codon - to - codon deterministic mutations are of theoretical importance . as shown in the propositions , the global optimal \n if the step limit is larger than the number of steps that global optimal can achieve , then we have some flexibility in our treatment plan . \n in addition , there exist multiple optimal paths with the same total cost , given the initial state and the final desired set . \n the optimal control problem of codon - to - codon stochastic mutations is of practical importance , since codon is the basic component forming long dna sequences . \n the step limit n is decided by doctors according to patients ' conditions , and the treatment plan is made according to the initial state , the final desired set , and the step limit . since the doctors constantly take measurement to see the result of treatments at current stage , the treatment plan is updated accordingly . solving codon - to - codon \n stochastic optimal control problem is a key step to realize the optimal control to gene - to - gene stochastic mutations in the real world . \n the optimal control sequences generated by dynamic programming make it possible for biologists and doctors to mutate certain sections of genes on purpose in laboratory , at a relative low cost and low risk , which is an essential step to identify the functional units , to examine the interactions among different segments , and to find healthy , harmful , and lethal nucleotide sequences . \n all those results are beneficial in gene network construction . in addition , the fundamental details of gene mutations at molecular level help biologists to elaborate on the biological theories at the cellular and tissue levels , such as the theory of evolution . moreover , by our method , biologists can distinguish the harmful and beneficial mutations and induce beneficial mutations during the evolution process in a proper way , which greatly helps to save rare species in danger . \n furthermore , our solution to the optimal control problem proposed provides a new medical intervention to genetic diseases . \n compared to the existing gene therapy , treatments by mutagens are safer by avoiding the side effect of virus infection . \n calculation errors , the mispairings in the process of two single - stranded dna segments , can be corrected at lowest cost by applying a correct mutagen sequence . \n further work can be done by extending codon - to - codon stochastic optimal control problem to gene - to - gene stochastic mutations . the distance reference between dna segment with equal length \n can be defined as a weighted sum of the distance references between codons . since certain combinations of amino acids \n this goal can be achieved by either defining a preset trajectory or eliminating high - risk sequences in the state space . \n under this situation , the spontaneous mutations can be modeled as an additional random factor in our state updating equations , and another random noises should be added to the output equation .", "ref": "we propose a molecular - level control system view of the gene mutations in dna replication from the finite field concept . by treating dna sequences as state variables , chemical mutagens and radiation as control inputs , one cell cycle as a step increment , and the measurements of the resulting dna sequence as outputs , we derive system equations for both deterministic and stochastic discrete - time , finite - state systems of different scales . defining the cost function as a summation of the costs of applying mutagens and the off - trajectory penalty , we solve the deterministic and stochastic optimal control problems by dynamic programming algorithm .

fundamental representations of color su(3 ) , respectively , and @xmath226 is the pq scale . the superpotential has a pq symmetry : @xmath227 $ ] , @xmath228 $ ] , @xmath229 $ ] and @xmath230 $ ] .\nthe indices @xmath40 and @xmath231 run from 1 to @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively . in order to avoid the axionic domain wall problem , we need @xmath234 in the hadronic axion model  @xcite . in order for the pq symmetry to be anomalous under the color su(3 ) for solving the strong cp problem , we need @xmath235 . for simplicity , we assume that the yukawa couplings @xmath236 and @xmath237 are independent of the indices @xmath40 and @xmath231 . the soft susy breaking potential is given by @xmath238 ^ 2 + m^2 \\abs[\\bar{\\phi}]^2 + m^2 \\abs[s]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have assumed that the soft masses @xmath149 are the same for @xmath239 and @xmath240 for simplicity and neglected trilinear terms.giving different soft masses to each field may shift the potential minimum and change axion decay constant by some factor , but the following qualitative argument does not change .\nwe rewrite the two superfields @xmath241 and @xmath242 in terms of the axion multiplet @xmath243 and heavy multiplet @xmath244 as @xmath245 where @xmath246 .\nthe axion @xmath247 and saxion @xmath248 are embedded in the scalar component of @xmath243 as @xmath249 .\nas long as the susy breaking mass is much smaller than the pq scale , @xmath241 and @xmath242 are constrained on @xmath250 .    for sufficiently high cosmic temperature ,\nthe thermal effects keep @xmath241 and @xmath242 at the origin . as the temperature decreases ,\n@xmath241 and @xmath251 begin to roll down toward the minimum .\nthe mass matrix for @xmath241 and @xmath251 around the origin , including thermal effects , is given by @xmath252 where @xmath253 .\nnote that , if @xmath232 and @xmath233 are larger than 1 , @xmath254 is possible even if @xmath255 .\nthus the temperature at the time of phase transition is evaluated as @xmath256 where , in our analysis , we assume that @xmath257 .\nthe ratio of radiation energy density to the total one just before the phase transition is then given by @xmath258 if there is no production of dark radiation , the ratio @xmath197 also corresponds to the relative magnitude of the gw spectrum , @xmath259 , as discussed in the previous sections .\nafter the phase transition , we only consider the effects of the particles in the axion multiplet @xmath243 .\nother particles in the pq sector have masses larger than @xmath260 if @xmath261 , which we will assume in this subsection .\nthen , we may eliminate @xmath242 in terms of @xmath241 by using @xmath250 , and obtain the potential for the scalar component of @xmath241 .\nfor the study of the behavior of the axion multiplet in the early universe , it is important to take account of various thermal effects  @xcite . in particular ,\nthe effective potential of @xmath241 is given in the following form : @xmath262 here , @xmath263 is the soft - mass term @xmath264 ^ 2 + m^2 \\abs[\\bar{\\phi}]^2     = m^2 \\abs[\\phi]^2 + m^2 \\frac{f^4}{\\abs[\\phi]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , @xmath265 and @xmath266 represent thermal effects .\n@xmath265 is the thermal log potential  @xcite , which comes from the fact that the masses of pq quarks depend on the amplitude of @xmath241 : @xmath267     \\simeq -2(a_2-a_1 ) \\alpha_3 ^ 2 t^4 \\ln \\abs[\\phi].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath265 is effective when the temperature is lower than the masses of pq quarks .\nfurthermore , @xmath266 is the thermal potential @xmath268 where @xmath269 and @xmath270 are masses of pq squarks and pq quarks , respectively .\nnote that @xmath266 is effective when the pq quarks are in the thermal bath , in contrast to @xmath265 .\nthe minimum of the potential depends on the temperature .\nfirst , in the low - temperature limit , @xmath271 .\nif the thermal log potential is efficient , the minimum is given by @xmath272 .\nfinally , in the high - temperature limit , the thermal mass term determines the minimum at @xmath273 .\nthe trajectory of the pq fields ( in particular , @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) during the phase transition depends on @xmath274 and @xmath275\n. therefore it may be the case that a considerable fraction of the initial vacuum energy may be transferred to the energy density of the saxion coherent oscillation . by using the parameter @xmath198 given in , we phenomenologically parameterize the fraction of @xmath276 transferred into the coherent oscillation energy density @xmath201 ; the fraction @xmath277 of @xmath276 , which corresponds to the energy density of the oscillation of the field transverse to the trajectory @xmath278 , is assumed to be instantly transferred into the energy densities of the axion and saxion : @xmath279 hereafter we consider the case where the initial vacuum energy does not go into the visible radiation .\nif @xmath198 is not negligible , the amplitudes of @xmath241 or @xmath242 can take large value due to the dynamics along the saxion direction .\nthe maximal value of @xmath280 $ ] during the coherent oscillation is @xmath281_{\\rm max }    \\simeq \\frac{\\lambda f^2 r_{\\rm coh}^{1/2}}{m}.    \\label{eq_coh_max}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath282 $ ] and @xmath283 , the pq quarks are not in thermal equilibrium if @xmath284 if this condition is satisfied , the saxion may be trapped at the local minimum and the onset of the saxion coherent oscillation may be delayed .\nthe subsequent evolution of the system depends on the decay rate and dissipation rate of the fields .\nfirst , let us consider the collision rate of the particles in the pq sector . without pq quarks in the thermal bath , the axion , saxion , and axino hardly communicate with the visible sector particles .\nthen , they may be sequestered from the visible sector and the temperature of the pq - sector particles may be different from that of the visible - sector particles . in particular , if the temperature of the pq sector particles , denoted as @xmath285 , is lower than @xmath286 , the collision rate among the pq sector particles is approximately given by @xmath287 thus , when @xmath285 becomes lower than the decoupling temperature @xmath288 , the pq - sector particles behave as dark radiation ( as long as they are relativistic ) , where @xmath288 is estimated as @xmath289 here the ratio of the energy density of the visible sector to the invisible one is @xmath290 in the absence of the saxion coherent oscillation , therefore the temperature of the visible sector at the time of the decoupling of the pq - sector particles is @xmath291 we also comment here that the effect of dissipation may be important in studying the evolution of the saxion in thermal bath @xcite . when pq quarks are not in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath292 ) , the dissipation rate of the axion , saxion and axino via the scattering with the gluon is @xcite @xmath293 when pq quarks are in thermal bath , on the other hand , ( s)axions collide with particles in the heavier multiplets with the rate @xmath294 with the choices of parameters for the following discussion , however , @xmath295 is smaller than the expansion rate of the universe so that the effects of dissipation are irrelevant .\nit means that the scattering rate between the pq sector and visible sector is so small that the pq sector is sequestered from the visible sector .\nthus we can define the temperature of the pq sector and the visible sector separately .\nafter the decoupling , the saxion decays at the late epoch .\nthe partial decay rates of the saxion into axion and gluon pairs are @xmath296 respectively , where , in deriving , we assumed that the difference of the vacuum expectation values of @xmath241 and @xmath242 is sizable .\nin addition , if @xmath241 couples to the higgs doublets , as @xmath297 , for example , and also if the higgsino mass is dominantly from the vacuum expectation value of @xmath241 , the saxion may also decay into the higgs - boson pair with the following decay rate : @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the higgsino mass . the decay temperature of the saxion is estimated by solving the following equation : @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the averaged energy of saxion at the cosmic temperature @xmath16 .\nthe decay temperature depends on the dominant decay mode of the saxion , and also on the typical energy of the saxion at the time of the decay .\nif @xmath302 and @xmath303 and the saxion dominantly decays into the higgs pair , the temperature of the visible sector @xmath178 just after the decay is estimated as @xmath304 where we approximated that @xmath305 and used @xmath306 as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the pq sector , and also assumed that the saxion decays while being relativistic .\nif the saxion decays after becoming non - relativistic , we obtain @xmath307    now let us see that the susy axion model can realize the cases 1 and 2 studied in and , respectively .\nthe role of @xmath115 is played by the pq scalar , @xmath241 and @xmath308 .\nafter the pq phase transition , they decay into particles in the axion multiplet , which are thermalized due to their self interactions .\n( here , we assume that the thermal bath of the pq sector particles are sequestered from that of the visible sector . ) at some point , the interactions of the pq sector particles become very weak .\nthen , the mean free path of the axion and saxion becomes so long that they behave as dark radiation @xmath78 .\nafter some periods , the saxion decays into radiation .\nif the saxion decays while it is relativistic , it corresponds to the case 1 and if it is non - relativistic , the case 2 is realized .\na sample parameter set corresponding to the case 1 is @xmath309 with the above parameters , we obtain @xmath310 the cosmological evolution goes as follows .\n* after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of @xmath241 and @xmath308 quickly decays into the particles in the axion multiplet . *\nafter the temperature drops down to @xmath311 , the collision rate in the pq sector becomes smaller than the hubble expansion rate .\nso axion , saxion and axino freely stream and hence behave as dark radiation .\n* if the field @xmath241 or @xmath242 couples to the higgs sector , the saxion can mainly decays into the higgs bosons .\nthe saxion decays at @xmath312gev before it becomes massive .\nthis eliminates about one - third of dark radiation .\nif the axino also decays without dominating the universe , @xmath313 at the present universe .\nthe features of the gw spectrum expected with the above setup are the same as , but the positions of the characteristic wavenumber are different . in , @xmath314 and @xmath315 is assumed while in the present setup they become @xmath316 and @xmath317 .\na sample parameter set corresponding to the case 2 is , @xmath318 which gives @xmath319 the cosmological evolution goes as follows .\n* after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of @xmath241 and @xmath308 quickly decays into the pq sector .\n* after the temperature drops down to @xmath311 , the collision rate in the pq sector becomes smaller than the hubble expansion rate , and the axion , saxion and axino become dark radiation .\n* the saxion becomes non - relativistic at @xmath320gev .\nthen , it decays into the higgs bosons at @xmath321gev .    the features in the gw spectrum with this setup are expected to be the same as in and , although the characteristic wavenumbers are different .\nif a large amount of the vacuum energy once goes into the coherent oscillation of the saxion , the case 5 may also be realized in the susy pq model . with a proper choice of parameters ,\nmost of the vacuum energy goes to the coherent oscillation of the saxion .\nthe saxion dominates the universe and then decays ; significant amount of the axion , which plays the role of dark radiation , may be produced by the decay with a relevant choice of parameters .    in this setup\n, the initial radiation is first diluted by the vacuum energy just like in the previous cases , and then diluted by the matter ( i.e. , saxion ) domination which begins just after the phase transition .\nthe former dilution can be parameterized by @xmath322 previously defined .\nlet us define the quantity @xmath216 , which parameterize the latter dilution : @xmath323 this determines the ratio of the spectral height at @xmath215 to that at @xmath324 .    the first example in the case 5 discussed in is realized with the following parameters : @xmath325 which result in @xmath326 thus , the cosmological evolution goes as follows :    * the thermal inflation caused by the vacuum energy of @xmath241 and @xmath242 dilutes the initial visible radiation by a factor of @xmath327 .\n* after the phase transition , almost all the vacuum energy goes to the saxion coherent oscillation .\nthe heavy quarks remain massive since is satisfied . *\nafter the coherent oscillation dilutes the radiation further by a factor of @xmath327 , it decays into visible radiation .\nthe second example in the case 5 is realized with the following parameters : @xmath328 which give @xmath329 the cosmological evolution goes as follows :    * the thermal inflation caused by the vacuum energy of @xmath241 and @xmath242 dilutes the initial visible radiation by a factor of @xmath330 .\n* after the phase transition , almost all the vacuum energy goes to the saxion coherent oscillation .\nthe heavy quarks remain massive since is satisfied .\n* the coherent oscillation dilutes the radiation by a factor of @xmath330 , and it soon decays into visible radiation .\nnext , we consider a susy majoron model  @xcite .\nthe mass of the right - handed neutrino , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism @xcite , can be generated as a consequence of u(1 ) symmetry breaking .\nthis u(1 ) may be identified as a gauged @xmath331 symmetry , or it can be global lepton number symmetry . here\nwe consider the latter option .\nthen a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson appears which is associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the u(1 ) global symmetry .\nthis ng boson is called majoron .\n( we call other fields in the majoron supermultiplet as smajoron , which is a real scalar field , and majorino , which is the fermionic superpartner of the majoron . )\nlet us consider the following superpotential as an example of a susy majoron model , @xmath332 where @xmath333 are the right - hand neutrinos , while @xmath241 and @xmath242 are lepton - number violating fields . in the following argument\n, we take @xmath334 for simplicity . in addition\n, we also introduce @xmath335 which have opposite lepton number .\nin contrast to the susy pq model , this model does not lead to the thermalization of the majoron sector with the sm sector since the neutrino yukawa coupling constants are taken to be small enough .\nnote also that the parameter @xmath226 , the u(1 ) symmetry breaking scale , is not severely constrained in contrast to the pq scale .    in the following , we assume that the majoron and the right - handed neutrinos are initially in the thermal bath .\n( we use the same notation as in the previous section for @xmath260 , @xmath336 , @xmath178 , @xmath198 and @xmath322 . )\nnow let us see that the susy majoron model can realize the case 3 and 4 studied in and .\nfor the case 3 , we take the following parameters : @xmath337 then , we obtain @xmath338 the cosmological evolution goes as follows :    * after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of @xmath241 and @xmath308 quickly decays into the majoron sector .\nthe majoron sector does not thermalize because of the weakness of the interaction of the majoron . *\nthe smajoron decays at @xmath312gev before it becomes massive .\nthis eliminates about one - half of the dark radiation , realizing the present @xmath339 .    for the case 4\n, we take the following parameters : @xmath340 the value of @xmath198 corresponds to and , respectively . with the above choice of parameters ,\n@xmath341 the cosmological evolution goes as follows :    * after the phase transition , a small fraction of the vacuum energy goes into the coherent oscillation of the smajoron .\nthe rest , the radial oscillation of @xmath241 and @xmath308 , quickly decays into the majoron sector particles\n. the majoron sector does not thermalize . *\nthe coherent oscillation of the smajoron begins to dominate the universe after the temperature decreases to @xmath342 and @xmath343 in and , respectively .\nthis dilutes the dark radiation produced at the phase transition .\nnote that the smajoron particles are still relativistic or just becoming non - relativistic at these temperatures . *\nthe coherent oscillation ( and smajoron particles in the case of , ) decays into visible radiation and the present @xmath94 becomes @xmath330 .\nin this paper we have studied various effects of the cosmological events in the early universe on the inflationary gw spectrum . in particular , some ( well - motivated ) models of cosmological phase transition , including the pq phase transition , in general lead to complicated structures in the gw spectrum , which might be detectable in future space - based gw detectors  @xcite . hence ,\nif the spectrum of the inflationary gws is determined by future experiments , it will give clues to the high - energy physics beyond the reach of accelerator experiments .\nfinally we mention inflation models which predict observable levels of gws .\nalthough the recent planck results do not favor the standard chaotic inflation model with a simple power - law potential  @xcite , a class of large field models has been proposed which fits the planck results well while predicts the tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath344  @xcite ( see refs .\n@xcite for early attempts ) .\nthe higgs inflation  @xcite predicts @xmath345 , which is within the reach of future gw detectors .\nthe @xmath346-inflation model  @xcite ( see refs .\n@xcite for its generalization ) and topological inflation  @xcite also predict observable gws with @xmath345 .\nwe thank k.  schmitz for comments regarding footnote  [ footnote:3 ] . this work is supported by grant -

[\nfig : ah ] ) .\nthus in the case of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we obtain the gw spectrum @xmath421 therefore , in the intermediate frequency region , the spectrum is proportional to @xmath212 ( see fig .  [ fig_pt_rd_twin ] ) .\nsimilarly , for @xmath422 and @xmath74 , we have @xmath423 for @xmath424 .\n[ fig_pt_md ] shows the gw spectrum for the case where the universe is matter dominated before thermal inflation and the vacuum energy instantly goes to radiation after the phase transition , with varying the ratio of matter energy density to the vacuum energy at the phase transition .\nit is seen that the spectrum scales as @xmath425 for @xmath426 .\nalthough the above arguments give global picture of the gw spectral shape , actually there appear an oscillatory feature in the gw spectrum for @xmath424 , which is not seen for @xmath427 and @xmath428 ( see e.g. , fig .\n[ fig_pt_rd_twin ] ) .\nbelow we see more detail on the oscillatory feature of the gw spectrum .\nthe gw with modes @xmath424 experience additional `` horizon exit '' and `` horizon entry '' processes compared with other modes ( see fig .  [\nfig : ah ] ) .\nlet us denote the value of @xmath429 and its time derivative at this horizon exit by @xmath430 and @xmath431 .\nnote that , although they take different values for different @xmath59 since they are oscillating , the combination @xmath432 ^ 2 + ( k / a)^2 [ h(t_{\\rm ex } , k , \\lambda)]^2 $ ] is roughly the same for different @xmath59 .\nafter the horizon exit , the equation of motion of gws is approximated by @xmath433 the general solution of which is given by @xmath434 where coefficients @xmath435 and @xmath436 are determined by the boundary condition at the horizon exit\n. then we find @xmath437 therefore the part of the gw energy density proportional to @xmath438 at the horizon exit soon damps . the modes with @xmath439 appear to be peaks in the gw spectrum .\non the other hand , the modes satisfying @xmath440 give troughs in the gw spectrum .\nthus we expect oscillatory features in the gw spectrum for @xmath441 in the case of thermal inflation .\nfirst we consider the case where the universe was rd dominated before thermal inflation .\nwe solve the friedmann equation @xmath442,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` ref '' denotes some reference time before the phase transition , to get @xmath443 where @xmath444 here we have assumed that the inflation diluted the radiation enough . in the following we consider gws which are well - inside around the vacuum - energy domination and well - outside the horizon at the phase transition .\nthe variable @xmath445 at the phase transition is @xmath446^{1/4 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{1/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{k}{a_{\\rm pt}h_{\\rm pt } } f_{\\rm r , pt}^{-1/4 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{1/2 } } , \\label{eq_upt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath447 and @xmath448 is the energy fraction of radiation at the phase transition .\nthe oscillation peaks appear with the period of @xmath449 in @xmath450 , with wavenumbers of our interest goes out of the horizon during thermal inflation .\none of the two solution to the equation of motion of gws soon damp outside the horizon ( see the previous subsection ) , and the peaks in the gw spectrum correspond to those wavenumbers which give maximal @xmath435 in .\nsuch wavenumbers appear with period @xmath449 in terms of @xmath451 ( here we denote `` horizon exit '' by `` he '' ) .\nthe point is that @xmath451 is almost the same as @xmath450 , since by the same calculation as we find @xmath452 with @xmath453 given by @xmath454 one finds @xmath455 because both of the two factors @xmath456 and @xmath457 are much larger than 1 .\nnote that @xmath458 although the gws are out of horizon at the phase transition . ]\ntherefore the gap between two neighboring peaks is @xmath459 from this equation and @xmath460 we obtain @xmath461 in the case of md universe before thermal inflation , we follow the same procedure . solving the friedmann equation @xmath462,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]\nwe get @xmath463 where @xmath464 then we get @xmath465^{1/3 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{2/3 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{k}{a_{\\rm pt}h_{\\rm pt } } f_{\\rm m , pt}^{-1/3 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{2/3}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath466 where @xmath467 is the energy fraction of matter at the phase transition .\nm.  s.  turner and f.  wilczek , phys .\nlett .   * 65 * , 3080 ( 1990 ) .\nn.  seto and j.  i .\nyokoyama , j.  phys .\n* 72 * , 3082 ( 2003 ) [ gr - qc/0305096 ] .\nh.  tashiro , t.  chiba and m.  sasaki , class .\n* 21 * , 1761 ( 2004 ) [ gr - qc/0307068 ] .\nl.  a.  boyle and p.  j.  steinhardt , phys .\nd * 77 * , 063504 ( 2008 ) [ astro - ph/0512014 ] .\nl.  a.  boyle and a.  buonanno , phys .\nd * 78 * , 043531 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0708.2279 [ astro - ph ] ] .\nk.  nakayama , s.  saito , y.  suwa and j.  i .\nyokoyama , phys .  rev .\nd * 77 * , 124001 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0802.2452 [ hep - ph ] ] .\nk.  nakayama , s.  saito , y.  suwa and j.  i .\nyokoyama , jcap * 0806 * , 020 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0804.1827 [ astro - ph ] ] .\ns.  kuroyanagi , t.  chiba and n.  sugiyama , phys .\nd * 79 * , 103501 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0804.3249 [ astro - ph ] ] .\nk.  nakayama and j.  i .\nyokoyama , jcap * 1001 * , 010 ( 2010 ) [ arxiv:0910.0715 [ astro-ph.co ] ] .\nk.  nakayama and f.  takahashi , jcap * 1011 * , 009 ( 2010 ) [ arxiv:1008.2956 [ hep - ph ] ] .\ns.  schettler , t.  boeckel and j.  schaffner - bielich , phys .\nd * 83 * , 064030 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1010.4857 [ astro-ph.co ] ] .\nr.  durrer and j.  hasenkamp , phys .\nd * 84 * , 064027 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1105.5283 [ gr - qc ] ] . s.  kuroyanagi , k.  nakayama and s.  saito , phys .  rev .\nd * 84 * , 123513 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1110.4169 [ astro-ph.co ] ] .\nr.  saito and s.  shirai , phys .\nb * 713 * , 237 ( 2012 ) [ arxiv:1201.6589 [ hep - ph ] ] .\nn.  seto , s.  kawamura and t.  nakamura , phys .\nlett .   * 87 * , 221103 ( 2001 ) [ astro - ph/0108011 ] ;

{"id": "dev_longform_250", "text": "astronomical source counts often suffer from a problem that multiple sources are located in a single beam of the observational instrument .\nthe obtained number counts will then be different from true ones , because the apparent position and flux of the sources are changed by blending of other , usually fainter sources .\nthis is called the source confusion , and the resulting measurement error is referred to as the confusion noise .    in its early stage ,\nconfusion problem has been investigated and formulated mainly by radio astronomers in relation to the so - called fluctuation analysis or @xmath3 analysis @xcite .\nthis analysis has been immediately applied and developed further in x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) and infrared astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nnow confusion problem also becomes important in submillimeter cosmology and high - precision astrometric missions ( cf .\ncosmologists compare model predictions with observed source counts to extract information of the evolution of galaxies and other objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthe confusion noise often prevents us from direct comparison between measured counts and predictions .\nespecially , recent advent of infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter facilities may have stimulated the discussion on the confusion problem .\ncompared with other wavelengths , we have relatively small aperture telescopes in the ir , mainly because ground - based observations are almost impossible , and we inevitably need cooled space telescopes . in the submillimeter\nthe antenna is relatively large up to @xmath4 , but the long wavelength also makes the single - dish surveys confusion - limited by a large diffraction .\ngenerally , the measurement error of the source flux blurs the true source counts .\nthis problem was originally pointed out by @xcite and deeply considered in subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n? * ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) , but there still remains some unsolved issues , especially when the error is dominated by the confusion noise .\nrecently monte carlo simulation has become popular to evaluate confusion effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) , but such an approach is sometimes not easy to interpret , and often time consuming . today , many large survey projects will be performed or completed soon , and a general analytical prescription for the confusion is desirable .\nfundamental assumption for the formulation of the confusion problem is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nhowever , this assumption is obviously not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe\n. a straightforward attempt to take into account the source clustering is to integrate over the spatial correlation functions along the line of sight .\nthis approach has been adopted by several works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) . among them , @xcite presented comprehensive results closely related to the present issue . since it requires the knowledge of _ three - dimensional correlation functions _\n, while it is a convenient method for theoretical predictions , observationally it is quite rare that we can obtain spatial information at the early phase of a survey .\nhence , we need a method to evaluate the confusion _ only from the projected information of source clustering_. in this line , @xcite has pioneered the methodology to tackle the riddle , but his results were restricted to a few simple cases . since then , little analytical progress on this topic has been made up to now .    in this work , by making extensive use of the methods of the theory of point process , we show the general analytic formula for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . in section  [ sec : fluctuation ]\n, we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then present the general formulae for inhomogeneous and clustered source distributions .\nbased on the new formulae , we reconsider how to treat the confusion noise in section  [ sec : confusion ] . in section  [ sec : application ] we formulate higher - order clustering of galaxies , which will be included in the general confusion problems .\nwe focus on far - infrared and submillimeter galaxies .\nsection  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .\nfactorial moments and cumulants are introduced in appendix  [ sec : factorial ] . in appendix\n[ sec : cumulants ] we derive the first- and second - order cumulants of clustered field .\nwe present a general expression for the rule - of - thumb to avoid confusion in appendix  [ sec : rule_of_thumb ] .\nglossary of the symbols are provided in appendix  [ sec : glossary ] .\nstatistics of fluctuation field is a fundamental tool for the confusion problem .\nwe first formulate the fluctuation of confusion noise in line with classical works @xcite , and then we translate it to the language of the theory of point fields @xcite . by this method\n, we can straightforwardly extend our formulation to the confusion problem of clustered sources ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .\nwe define a probability density function ( hereafter pdf ) of a source having a flux @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 we set @xmath8 , the beam pattern (

@xmath13 is the flux of the @xmath14-th source , and @xmath15 is the angular position of the source . for the following discussion\nwe need to define a flux signal that consists of exactly @xmath16

following recursive convolution : @xmath38 since the lt of a convolution of two functions is a normal product of the lts of them , the pdf of @xmath39 , @xmath40 gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 then we

.\nthe concept of confusion noise and confusion limit is closely related to the fluctuation field @xmath25 .\n@xcite formulated the confusion limit for a power - law source number counts .\nhis formulation was then extended for general number counts by @xcite . @xcite\nhave made some improvement for precise calculation by the method .\nwe should note that the confusion noise affects source counts up to the flux much larger than that of confusion limit @xcite .\nwe reconsider the confusion problems in this section .\nfirst we review the problems related to the confusion noise .\n@xcite proposed an important concept that existence of any statistical noise makes the observed source counts biased upward . now this well - known phenomenon is called the ` eddington bias ' .\nhe considered the case that the noise is gaussian .\nafter that , a large amount of efforts has been made to treat and correct the bias by subsequent authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthe outline of these ideas is briefly summarized in @xcite , in comparison with their own method .\nproblems with gaussian noise is beautifully formulated by @xcite .\ntheir setting assumes that the dispersion of the error does not depend on the source flux .\neven in such a simple case , @xcite showed that the confusion noise can be very severe for sources with low signal - to - noise ratios .\nthey pointed out that when the confusion noise dominate the error , the total noise can not be gaussian , and gave a qualitative discussion on the problem .\nthey claim to use a monte carlo approach to evaluate in that case .\nhowever , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , we have an expression for the fluctuation field , and we can utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . @xcite\nproperly distinguish between the problems of _ confusion _ and _ blending _ : the former generally means that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which can not be detected by the considered instrument individually , and the latter indicates that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which is bright enough to be detected as a source if they were located far from the central brightest source .\nthe term ` confusion limit ' is related to the former phenomenon , and consequently , confusion limit flux is weaker than the noise flux for bright sources .    how to treat these two effects in a unified manner ?\nof course they occur in a same way , hence there is no distinction in principle .\nconsider an ideal situation that there are no detector noise , photon noise , read - out noise , nor any other cosmological diffuse background radiation with structure .\nthen the noise intensity distribution is the fluctuation pdf itself .\nhere we consider a source with true flux @xmath10 .\nthe situation is schematically described in figure  [ fig : pd ] .\nthe source is inevitably affected by other sources in a same beam .\nthe total noise intensity in the beam is @xmath37 .\nif @xmath110 , then the source is observed with flux @xmath111 ( see the middle panel of figure  [ fig : pd ] ) .\non the other hand , if @xmath37 is dominated by a bright source @xmath112 , then the source is observed as an additive noise of the brighter source with flux @xmath112 ( the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pd ] ) .\nhowever , @xcite pointed out that there is a possibility that the signal @xmath37 consists of two or more sources with fluxes fainter than @xmath10 .\nthe probability of such multiple source blending is obtained by the same manner as discussed in  [ sec : fluctuation ] .\nagain we should consider @xmath113 , under the condition @xmath114 and the probability of having a noise intensity @xmath37 produced by @xmath81 sources is expressed by a convolution [ equation  ( [ eq : dfx_conv ] ) ] . for @xmath37 to be a mere noise , there must not be sources brighter than @xmath10 in a beam .\nhence , we should derive the conditional probability of having @xmath37 caused by @xmath81 sources under the condition @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and then sum up for all @xmath81s .\nit may seem to be a complicated problem , but it can be simplified by laplace transform . by restricting the range of integration from 0 to @xmath10 in equation  ( [ eq : lfg ] ) we have the lt of the conditional pdf as @xmath117^k \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we have the lt of the desired total conditional pdf , @xmath118 , as @xmath119d{{\\bm x } }      \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for unclustered point sources , and @xmath120      w_{k}\\,d{{\\bm x}}_1\\cdots d{{\\bm x}}_k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for clustered sources .\nhence , in order to obtain the confused number counts from the true ones , we should convolve the fluctuation distribution @xmath25 itself at @xmath110 , and @xmath118 at @xmath121 .\nthis consideration naturally explains the fact that the confusion noise flux is stronger than the confusion limit flux .\nsince we have a variety of background in the image data in a real situation , we fit and subtract from the obtained flux , the noise is not necessarily positive .\nthus in practice , the dependence of the confusion noise distribution on flux @xmath10 causes only a weak variation along @xmath10 under the existence of other kind of noise , because of the convolution with other noise .\nwe next formulate the relation between the beam size @xmath122 and the source confusion limit for simplicity .\nthis is not an essential assumption for the subsequent discussions . ] .\nthe basic procedure is to estimate the limit signal strength as an upper cutoff of the integration in the second - order cumulant formulae in equation  ( [ eq : cumulants_2 ] ) or equation  ( [ eq

remains a matter of debate ( for a comprehensive overview , see * ? ? ?\n* ) , and various models have been advocated in order to describe the correlation function of galaxies .\ngenerally , a hierarchy of the correlation functions continues to infinite order , hence we should introduce a certain closure relation to cut the sequence .\nthe hierarchical _ ansatz _ is often employed for the correlation functions , both from phenomenological basis ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and theoretical considerations of bbgky equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthe _ ansatz _ claims that the @xmath81-point correlation is described by a product of @xmath145 two - point correlation functions .\nthese studies consider the three - dimensional correlations , but we can relate them to two - dimensional ones in a simple way @xcite .\nwe apply the following hierarchical relations for angular galaxy correlation on the sky @xcite : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a numerical factor to determine the strength of clustering , and the summation @xmath148 is taken over all tree topologies of graphs between points ( fig .\n[ fig : graph ] ) . for the details of the expansion , see @xcite .\nnow we focus on the distribution of infrared galaxies , to have some insight to the confusion in the forthcoming infrared and submillimeter galaxy surveys .\ntoday , many large infrared and submillimeter missions are planned or in progress , and their source confusion limits for galaxies have been calculated for each facility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthey all assumes the random distribution of galaxies on the sky . in order to obtain the confusion limits more precisely\n, we must take into account the clustering of infrared galaxies properly .    by using the density moment technique ,\n@xcite estimated the coefficients @xmath149 in equation  ( [ eq : hierarchical ] ) for _ iras _  1.2  jy sample .\nwe use these values up to @xmath150 to approximate the clustering : @xmath151 and @xmath152 .\nthe two - point angular correlation function is @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 for the _ iras _\n1.2jy sample .\nwe can obtain the clustering of any deeper surveys via scaling relations of the correlation functions with the characteristic depth of the survey , @xmath156 @xcite : @xmath157 where superscript 0 represents that it is evaluated at @xmath158  jy at @xmath159 m , i.e. , @xmath160 , and @xmath156 is the relative characteristic depth of the survey , defined as @xmath161/s\\,[\\mbox{jy}])^{1/2}$ ] .\nwe observe that the contribution of higher - order clustering rapidly decreases with increasing depth of the survey .\nthis dilution of clustering is more effective for higher - order correlations .\nnow we obtain the two - point correlation function @xmath162 at an arbitrary flux @xmath10 through equation  ( [ eq : depth_scaling_2 ] ) as @xmath163}{s\\,[\\mbox{jy } ] }      \\right)^{-1.79/2 } w_2 ^ 0(\\theta ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , from

& 138 & 9332 +    in order to evaluate how strong the correlation structure affects the confusion - related quantities , we first calculate these statistics based on power - law number count models [ equation  ( [ eq : nc_power ] ) ] , @xmath167 with the power - law indices @xmath168 , 3.0 , and 3.5 , i.e. , the indices of the integrated counts are @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively . here , consider a survey at @xmath159 m .\nthe power - law number counts are normalized so that they have the same counts with the _ iras\n_  qmw galaxy survey at a flux @xmath170  jy @xcite .\nit is observationally known that the bright end of the counts is well approximated by euclidean , because cosmological and evolutionary effects are both negligible . actually , _\nqmw galaxy counts shows a good fit to the euclidean slope ( slope index @xmath168 in differential counts ) , and we can safely fix the slope of the model @xmath0 to be 2.5 above the flux\n@xmath171  jy . we estimated the confusion - related statistics for the cases with and without clustering .\nwe assume a telescope with an aperture of @xmath172 with an ideal airy function as a psf , and the detection limit of the instrument is 50  mjy .\nas discussed above , the clustering of galaxies depends on the detected flux : brighter sources have stronger clustering on the sky , and the clustering gradually becomes weaker toward fainter flux .\nthis makes the exact formulation for the statistical characteristic of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution prohibitively difficult ( see * ? ? ?\n* ) , and unfortunately , an exact mathematical theory to treat this problem has not fully established yet . in order to calculate the confusion limit with clustering , we approximate the clustering of the whole sample galaxies evaluated at a ` fiducial ' flux , @xmath173 , instead of the flux - dependent clustering in gradual way .\nfluctuation consists not only of the detected sources but also of unresolvable sources fainter than detection limit , in principle , toward infinitesimally faint flux .\ntherefore , the fiducial flux is fainter than the point source detection limit .\nwe assumed that the fiducial flux is proportional to detection limit .\nbased on this assumption , we calibrated the fiducial flux empirically so as to reproduce the _ iras _\nconfusion limit ( @xmath174 : * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nwe found that the relation @xmath175 can be used to evaluate the average clustering strength of the _ iras _  galaxy sample .\nnamely , all the galaxies with @xmath176 are approximated to have the same correlation functions [ @xmath177 , etc . ] and ignore the contribution from the sources with @xmath178 .\nof course , exact treatment of this part remains to be theoretically improved .\nwe calculated the confusion limits from the power - law model counts . without clustering , the confusion limits would be 3.1  mjy , 22.9  mjy , and 138  mjy for the indices @xmath179 , and 2.5 , respectively .\nif we take into account the effect of clustering properly , they become 3.8  mjy , 120  mjy , and 9.33  jy , for @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively ( see table  [ tab : conf_power_law ] ) .\nthus , the confusion - limit flux get larger , and the effect of clustering strongly depends on the count slope . especially , if the cumulative count slope @xmath166 exceeds @xmath180 , its effect will be catastrophic .\nwe also obtained the pdf of the fluctuation intensity for infrared galaxies under the same assumptions .\nfigure  [ fig : conf_noise15 ] shows the pdf with the integral number count slope index @xmath181 .\nthe peak probability decreases by clustering .\nthe clustering also result in a broadening of the pdf @xcite .\nit also should noted that the probability of finding a very low intensity at a certain position ( closely related to ` the void probability ' ) increases when clustering takes place .\nthe effect of clustering becomes very strong when the slope index approaches @xmath182 , as presented in figure  [ fig : conf_noise20 ] . in this case\n, we have already found that the clustering makes the confusion limit much shallower than that of unclustered case .\nit means that the rms of the confusion noise is large .\nactually , we found that the broadening of the pdf by clustering is very strong , and result in a large variance of the fluctuation pdf ( fig .\n[ fig : conf_noise20 ] ) . in summary\n, the effect of clustering can be very severe if the number counts are described by _ a single power - law_. the above result shows that the relative contribution of clustering to the total fluctuation compared with poisson component becomes larger for large @xmath0 .\nthese are consistent with the results reported by @xcite for dusty galaxies at ir wavelengths .\nas mentioned above , their approach is more model - oriented than the present work , based on the simple model of the spatial two - point correlation function of galaxies .\ntheir central aim was to estimate the power spectrum of the fluctuation in the submillimeter and radio background , and they considered only the two - point correlation , i.e. , second - order statistics . since confusion limit is the second - order quantity , hence both methods can be used , and yield consistent estimates , though our method requires only projected information .\nour formulation is fundamentally based on the pdf , and it is the most suitable method of calculating it from the measured projected information ( see  [ sec : fluctuation ] ) . in order to extend toffolatti et al.s method to calculate the pdf , it is necessary to model the bispectrum , trispectrum , and higher - order spectrum or their equivalents ( for thorough formulation , see * ? ? ?\nit is a theoretically interesting but challenging problem , and again we see that their method is suitable to theoretical models .              ccc wavelength & +

galaxy surveys by _ iso _ revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy counts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .\ngalaxies detected at 90  @xmath184 m or 170  @xmath184 m show a rapid increase in number counts at @xmath185  mjy , with cumulative slope @xmath186 .\nthere have never been any model that succeeded in reproducing the extremely steep number - count slope of _ iso _  sources perfectly , even though many elaborate models have been presented to date .\nbut such a rapid increase of infrared galaxy can not be continued toward a fainter flux level , because the integrated infrared flux from galaxies must not exceed the observational constraint of the cosmic infrared background ( for the details , see , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthis makes a change of the slope of the observed number counts of galaxies .\nwe show some calculations of the confusion limits for such realistic counts based on an empirical model of @xcite .\nthe parameters are taken from @xcite and @xcite .\nthe calculation method is the same for the case of power - law number counts , except that we should use equation  ( [ eq : conf_general_cluster ] ) instead of equation  ( [ eq : conf_power_cluster ] ) .\nwe obtained the confusion limits of 1.8  mjy for unclustered sources and 2.0  mjy for clustered sources for a model number count at @xmath187 m .\nthey are 11.4  mjy and 12.3  mjy at @xmath188 m , and 105  mjy and 120  mjy at @xmath189 m . we summarize these limits in table  [ tab : conf_model ] .\nthus in the far - infrared , source clustering does not affect the confusion limit significantly .\nthis is explained as follows : since the cosmic expansion makes the slope flatter toward fainter fluxes , the count slope becomes sub - euclidean at the flux level we consider here , in spite of the strong galaxy evolution .\nthe effect of clustering is dominated by the faintest clustered sources , hence the decrease of differential counts makes the effect rather small .\nthen , let us consider the pdf of the fluctuation for realistic number counts .\nwe calculated the pdf for wavelengths @xmath190 , and @xmath189 m . figures  [ fig : conf_noise060 ] , [ fig : conf_noise090 ] , and [ fig : conf_noise170 ] show the pdfs of the fluctuation in these wavelengths .\njust as seen in the power - law count models , the peak probability decreases up to @xmath2  % , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier .\nwe also find an increase of the probability of finding a small flux density .\nthe clustering effect may not seem very severe , because present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics .\nhowever , we must keep this effect in mind when we estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data that will be obtained by _ astro - f _ and _\nsirtf_.    remind that we assumed the constant clustering strength in this analysis .\none may expect a smaller clustering at higher redshift , but biased galaxy formation scenario predicts even stronger clustering for high - redshift dusty galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\nthus , we should take care of the effect in future infrared data analysis .      in the submillimeter wavelengths ,\nconfusion effects are very serious in single - dish observations @xcite .\nalthough some large interferometric facilities are under construction , the confusion problem will remain an important issue that should be properly considered for future airborne or space submillimetric observational projects such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture sub - millimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory_. as seen above , we need a two - point correlation function of dusty galaxies , whose reliable observational estimate has not been available yet @xcite . for the estimation of the galaxy confusion effect in future submillimeter large surveys ( see ,\ne.g. , * ? ? ?\n* and references therein ) , accurate estimation of the clustering properties is desired . the measured confusion limit from scuba survey data\nwas found to be shallower than that expected from classical formula ( d.  h.  hughes 2003 , private communication ) , hence the effect of clustering may take place .\nif we assume that the scuba galaxies have the same clustering property with _ iras _  galaxies , clustering increases the confusion limit from 20  % to 100  % , depending on the adopted assumption for the spectral energy distribution of galaxies .\nmost of the submillimeter galaxies are dusty vigorous starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) , and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation .\nhence , the statistical structure of the submillimeter background carries crucial information of the spatial distribution of high - redshift starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\nour analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated cosmological models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\nthe source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington .\nfundamental assumption of the formulation is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky .\nhowever , this assumption is not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe .\nclustering increases the confusion effect to some extent , but it is not an easy task to formulate the effect in the confusion problem . by using a model for spatial correlation functions , @xcite showed a useful result for the contribution of clustering to the fluctuation of the background at submillimeter and radio wavelengths .\nobservationally , however , the method to evaluate the confusion only from two - dimensional information of clustering is desirable . in this line ,\nonly the work of @xcite has made attempt to tackle the difficult problem and given solutions to a few simple cases .    in this work , by making extensive use of the methods related to the point field theory , we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .\nbased on the general formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies .\nwe considered an infrared facility with an aperture of 70 cm and an ideal airy psf . for galaxy clustering\n, we adopted the hierarchical _ ansatz _ to calculate higher - order correlation functions used in our formulation . without clustering ,\nthe confusion limits would be 3.1mjy , 23  mjy , and 138  mjy for the indices @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .\nif we take into account the effect of clustering properly , they become 3.8  mjy , 120  mjy , and 9.9  jy , for @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .\nwe also obtained the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity , @xmath25 .\nwe found a broadening of the pdf by clustering , i.e. , increase of the variance , corresponding to the increase of the confusion limit flux density .\nwhen @xmath0 approaches to 2.0 , the clustering effect becomes very severe for a power - law number counts .\nthen we estimated the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model of @xcite , under the same hypothetical infrared facility . at @xmath191\nm , we obtained confusion limits of 2.0mjy for infrared galaxies . at @xmath188 m and @xmath189 m ,\nthe confusion limits are 12.3mjy and 120mjy , respectively .\nthese estimates are not much different from the limits calculated without clustering [ 1.8mjy ( @xmath191 m ) , 11.4mjy ( @xmath188 m ) , and 105mjy ( @xmath189 m ) ] .\nthe gradual flattening of the number count slope toward the fainter flux densities , which is observed for infrared galaxies , makes the clustering effect very small , even though the slope is very steep at @xmath192 . as for the pdf at these wavelength bands\n, the peak probability also decreases up to @xmath2  % , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier .\nthe clustering effect may not seem very severe , because present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics .\nhowever , we must keep this effect in mind when we estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data by _ astro - f _ and _\nsirtf_.    we will also apply our method to future submillimeter large surveys .\nmost of the submillimeter galaxies are dusty vigorous starbursts , and the

we first calculate the confusion statistics for power - law galaxy number counts as a test case . when the slope of differential number counts , @xmath0 , is steep , the confusion limits becomes much brighter and the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation field is strongly distorted . then we estimate the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model for infrared galaxies . the gradual flattening of the slope of the source counts makes the clustering effect rather mild . clustering effects result in an increase of the limiting flux density with @xmath1% . in this case , the peak probability of the pdf decreases up to @xmath2 % and its tail becomes heavier . though the effects are relatively small , they will be strong enough to affect the

definite bandwidth matrix .\nit is , however , well known that an estimator such as ( [ eqn : kerncopbasstar ] ) is in general not consistent on the boundaries of @xmath23 : it does not ` feel ' the support boundaries of the underlying density and places through @xmath24 positive mass outside that support .\nin fact , standard kernel density arguments show that @xmath25 at corners ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 on the borders ( @xmath28 ) .\nalthough some papers ignored these boundary issues @xcite , it is clear that accurate estimation of @xmath16 calls for some boundary correction .\nsuch corrections have indeed been proposed , inspired by ideas developed for univariate density estimation , e.g.  mirror reflection @xcite or the usage of boundary kernels @xcite , but with mixed results .\nsecondly , kernel estimators are not consistent for unbounded densities .\nyet , unlike most common probability densities , many copula densities of interest are unbounded .\nfor instance , even in the apparently easy case of a bivariate normal vector with moderate correlation , the copula density is unbounded in two of the corners of @xmath23 .\nit is , therefore , particularly important to use estimators able to cope with such unboundedness .\nfinally , estimating @xmath16 can not be made from a genuine random sample from its cdf @xmath0 , as @xmath0 is the distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath6 and @xmath10 are typically unknown .\nhence , the observations @xmath30 are unavailable , and estimator ( [ eqn : kerncopbasstar ] ) is , in fact , infeasible . in the copula literature , it is customary to use the ` pseudo -

sample @xmath35 is treated mostly as a sample from @xmath0 and used instead of the ` true ' sample @xmath36 , although this may affect the statistical properties of the ensuing estimators @xcite .\nthe aim of this paper is to propose and study a new , kernel - type estimator of the copula density @xmath16 .\nit is , in fact , the extension to the copula density case of the kernel - type estimator for univariate densities supported on the unit interval recently suggested in @xcite . that estimator takes the constrained nature of the support into account from the outset , i.e.  without relying on _ ad hoc _ boundary corrections ( reflection , boundary kernels , etc . ) .\nit proved superior to its main competitors in the simulation studies for a wide range of density shapes , including for unbounded densities .\nthe idea seems , therefore , suitable for estimating copula densities as well .\nspecifically , @xcite s estimator makes use of the transformation method , building on ideas first suggested in ( * ? ? ?\n* chapter 9 ) and @xcite . in short ,\nthe initial @xmath1$]-supported variable of interest is transformed through the probit function into a variable whose support is unconstrained , the density of that transformed variable is estimated and an estimate of the initial density on @xmath1 $ ] is obtained by back - transformation .\nthis method appears very natural and yields very good results , provided that the estimation step in the transformed domain is carried out with care , as @xcite s results showed .\nexploring this idea in more details in the context of copula density estimation is the topic of section [ sec : probtransfcop ] .\nseveral versions of the estimators will be suggested , and their asymptotic properties will be derived in section [ sec : asympt ] .\nsection [ sec : bandwidth ] will address the crucial point of smoothing parameter selection in this framework .\nsimulation studies evidencing the very good practical behaviour of the probit - transformation estimators ( section [ sec : sim ] ) , a real data analysis ( section [ sec : realdat ] ) and some final remarks ( section [ sec : ccl ] ) conclude the paper .\nas recalled above , direct kernel estimation of the density @xmath16 of @xmath37 is made difficult mainly by the constrained nature of its support @xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] .\nnow , define @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the standard normal cdf and @xmath41 is its quantile function ( i.e.  the probit transformation ) .\ngiven that both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath44}$ ] , @xmath45 and @xmath46 both follow standard normal distributions , which , nevertheless , does not imply that the vector @xmath47 is bivariate normal\n. that will only be the case if the copula of the joint cdf of @xmath47 , say @xmath48 , is the gaussian copula , that is , if the copula @xmath0 of @xmath8 itself is the gaussian copula , as copulas are invariant to increasing transformations of their margins ( * ? ? ?\n* theorem 2.4.3 ) .\nthe idea is that , if @xmath49 lebesgue - a.e .  over @xmath23 ( which will be assumed throughout the paper ) ,\n@xmath47 has unconstrained support @xmath50 and estimating its density @xmath51 can not suffer from boundary issues .\nin addition , due to its normal margins , one can expect @xmath51 to be well - behaved , and its estimation easy .\nin particular , under mild assumptions , @xmath51 and its partial derivatives up to the second order will be seen to be uniformly bounded on @xmath50 , even in the case of unbounded copula density @xmath16 ( lemma [ lem : unicont ] in the appendix ) .\nas the copula of @xmath48 is @xmath0 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one can write sklar s theorem ( [ eqn : copdef ] ) for @xmath47 : @xmath54 upon differentiation with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath13 , the joint density @xmath51 of @xmath47 is found to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the standard normal density .\ninverting this expression , one obtains @xmath58 for any @xmath59 .\nso , any estimator @xmath60 of @xmath51 on @xmath50 automatically produces an estimator of the copula density on the interior of @xmath23 , viz .\n@xmath61 where the superscript @xmath62 refers to the idea of transformation .\nwhen necessary , @xmath63 can also be defined at the boundaries of @xmath23 by continuity .\nthis estimator enjoys interesting properties .\nclearly , @xmath63 can not allocate any positive probability weight outside @xmath23 , since @xmath64 is not defined for @xmath65 . also , if @xmath60 is a _ bona fide _ density function , in the sense that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then automatically @xmath69 for all @xmath15 and @xmath70 .\nthis is easily seen through the changes of variable @xmath71 and @xmath72 .\nfinally , if @xmath60 is a uniformly ( weak or strong ) consistent estimator for @xmath51 , i.e.  @xmath73 in probability or almost surely as @xmath74 , the estimator @xmath63 inherits that uniform consistency on any compact proper subset of @xmath23 .\na first natural idea would be to use the standard kernel density estimator as @xmath60 in ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) .\nspecifically , one would like to use an estimator like @xmath75 where @xmath24 is a bivariate kernel function and @xmath76 is some symmetric positive - definite bandwidth matrix , and @xmath77 is the sample in the transformed domain .\nhowever , as the @xmath30 s are unavailable in this context , so are the @xmath78 s .\ninstead , one has to use @xmath79 the pseudo - transformed sample . the feasible version of ( [ eqn : fststar ] ) is , therefore , @xmath80 through ( [ eqn : copratio ] )\n, this directly leads to the following probit transformation kernel copula density estimator : @xmath81 this is essentially the estimator suggested in @xcite , also used as - is in @xcite , although it was not studied in any details in those two papers .\n@xcite derived the theoretical properties of an estimator for the copula @xmath0 ( not its density ) based on the same transformation .\nthis idea was , however , called ` naive ' in @xcite in the univariate case .\nin fact , the method does not provide good results close to the boundaries , even though it was designed to fix boundary issues .\nindeed , the estimator ( [ eqn : naivefeas ] ) will be seen not to perform well in the next sections .\n@xcite explained the reasons for that failure , and suggested some remedies .\nin particular , estimating the density in the transformed domain via local likelihood methods @xcite offers a promising alternative while keeping the simplicity and the intuitive appeal of the probit - transformation estimator .\nthis is investigated for estimating a copula density in the next subsection .\n@xcite and @xcite proposed two different , although similar in many aspects , formulations of the local likelihood density estimator . @xcite\nlocally approximates the logarithm of the unknown density by a polynomial , whereas @xcite consider local parametric density modelling .\nthis paper will only make use of @xcite s idea , mainly because the asymptotic theory is more transparent . in any case , both formulations share most of their advantages and drawbacks , and typically yield very similar estimates .    in this setting of estimating @xmath51 from the pseudo - sample @xmath82 , @xcite s local likelihood estimator is defined as follows .\naround @xmath83 , @xmath84 is assumed to be well approximated by a polynomial of some order @xmath85 .\nclassically , only local log - linear ( @xmath86 ) and local log - quadratic ( @xmath87 ) estimators are considered .\nspecifically , in the first case ( @xmath86 ) , it is assumed that , for @xmath88 ` close ' to @xmath67 , @xmath89 and in the second case ( @xmath87 ) @xmath90 the vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 are then estimated by solving a weighted maximum likelihood problem . for either @xmath93 , @xmath94 where , as previously , @xmath24 is a bivariate kernel function and @xmath76 is a symmetric positive - definite bandwidth matrix . the estimate of @xmath51 at @xmath67 is then , naturally , @xmath95 for local log - linear , and @xmath96 for local log - quadratic modelling . ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimators for @xmath17 are finally obtained through ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) as @xmath97 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .\nthe motivation and the advantages of estimating @xmath51 by local likelihood methods instead of raw kernel density estimation are related to the detailed discussion in @xcite , and are therefore omitted here .\nthe asymptotic properties of these estimators ( ` naive ' and ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimators ) are derived in the next section .\nfor simplicity , it will be assumed that @xmath24 is a product gaussian kernel , i.e.  @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for some @xmath100 .\nnote that , in practice , there are reasons to keep an unconstrained , non - diagonal bandwidth matrix @xmath76 .\nin particular , the copula density is typically stretched along one of the diagonals of the unit square when some dependence is present in @xmath101 , which provides a density @xmath51 likewise stretched along one of the 45 degrees lines in @xmath50 .\nhence , using a bandwidth matrix directing smoothing in that particular direction is sensible @xcite , as discussed further in section [ sec : bandwidth ] .\nthat said , theoretical results for that general case would be less tractable than , while qualitatively equivalent to , the simpler case presented below .\nnote that for that particular kernel @xmath24 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 .\nthese quantities frequently arise in the properties of kernel estimators , and direct use of these particular numerical values will be made in the results below .\nconsider the naive estimator ( [ eqn : naivefeas ] ) which , with the above specifications of @xmath24 and @xmath76 , reduces to @xmath105 given ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , it is clear that its statistical properties will entirely depend on those of ( [ eqn : fsthat ] ) , here @xmath106 if @xmath51 admits continuous second - order partial derivatives , expressions for the bias and the variance of the ideal , infeasible estimator @xmath107 ( [ eqn : fststar ] ) , as well as its asymptotic normality , are well known ( * ? ? ?\n* chapter 4 ) .\nproposition [ thm : fshat ] below ascertains that using the pseudo - observations ( [ eqn : pseudosamp ] ) instead of genuine ones does not affect those properties .\nnote that ( [ eqn : fsthat2 ] ) can be written @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the empirical copula @xmath110 hence , although living in the transformed domain , the behaviour of @xmath111 will be driven by the properties of @xmath109 on @xmath23 .\nthe following assumptions will be made .\n[ ass : fxy ] the sample @xmath12 is an i.i.d\n.  sample from the joint distribution @xmath8 , an absolutely continuous distribution with marginals @xmath6 and @xmath10 strictly increasing on their support ;    [ ass : cop ] the copula @xmath0 of @xmath8 is such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 exist and are continuous on @xmath114\\}$ ] , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 exist and are continuous on @xmath117,v\\in ( 0,1)\\}$ ] .\nin addition , there are constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 such that @xmath120 ;\n\\\\ \\displaystyle \\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 c } { \\partial v^2}(u , v ) \\right| & \\leq & \\displaystyle \\frac{k_2}{v(1-v ) } \\qquad   \\text { for } ( u , v ) \\in [ 0,1 ] \\times ( 0,1 ) ; \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    [ ass : copdens ] the density @xmath16 of @xmath0 exists , is positive and admits continuous second -

value copulas .\nmoreover , @xcite explicitly show that they are satisfied by the clayton , gumbel , gaussian and student copulas .\ncompared to @xcite , assumption [ ass : copdens ] only requires further the existence and continuity of second - order partial derivatives of @xmath16 , which is natural in kernel estimation .\nit is worth noting that @xmath16 is allowed to grow unboundedly in some of the corners of @xmath23 , provided ( [ eqn : unbounded ] ) remains valid .\nthe following result can now be stated .\nan important observation is that it holds true for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , which includes the optimal bandwidth order known to be @xmath125 for bivariate density estimation .\n[ thm : fshat ] assume that @xmath126 and @xmath99 with @xmath123 for some @xmath127 . under assumptions [ ass :\nfxy]-[ass : copdens ] , the estimator ( [ eqn : fsthat2 ] ) at any @xmath83 is such that @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    see appendix .    as recalled in section [ sec : intro ] , resorting to pseudo - observations is known to usually affect the statistical properties of the estimators of interest in copula modelling .\nin particular , an overriding result in the field is the weak convergence of the empirical copula process @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a bivariate pinned @xmath0-brownian sheet on @xmath23 , i.e.  the tight centred gaussian process whose covariance function is @xmath133 @xcite .\nin fact , @xmath132 would be the limiting process if the margins were known , i.e.  if ` genuine ' @xmath134 s and @xmath135 s were used in ( [ eqn : empcop ] ) .\nthe extra two terms in the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : limitempcop ] ) are , therefore , often interpreted as ` the price to pay ' for using pseudo - observations  although this effect is sometimes advantageous @xcite . yet\n, the proof of proposition [ thm : fshat ] reveals that the effect of those two terms asymptotically vanishes when one looks at the properties of the kernel density estimator ( [ eqn : fsthat2 ] ) . as a result , the rate of convergence , as well as the expressions for asymptotic bias and variance , are the same as what one would obtain for the ideal estimator @xmath107 using genuine i.i.d .  observations from @xmath0 . intuitively , this is because a kernel density estimator converges slower than an empirical distribution function .\nresorting to pseudo - observations may disturb the @xmath136-convergence of the latter , but it goes unnoticed ( asymptotically ) compared to the nonparametric convergence rate @xmath137 of the former .\nnow , differentiating ( [ eqn : fst ] ) yields @xmath138 ( and similar for @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) .\nhence , combining ( [ eqn : fst ] ) , ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , ( [ eqn : normfsthat ] ) and ( [ eqn : secondderfst ] ) , one can state the following theorem for the ` naive ' probit transformation kernel copula density estimator ( [ eqn : naivefeas2 ] ) .    [ thm : chat ] under the assumptions of proposition [ thm : fshat ] , the ` naive ' probit transformation kernel copula density estimator ( [ eqn : naivefeas2 ] ) at any @xmath59 is such that @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .\nsee appendix .\nit is seen that , when @xmath145 approaches one of the boundaries , both the ( asymptotic ) bias and variance of the estimator tend to grow unboundedly .\nindeed , @xmath146 and @xmath147 includes the term @xmath148 , and the functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are unbounded .\nthus , along the boundaries , @xmath63 will work properly only over areas , if any , where @xmath16 approaches 0 very smoothly .\notherwise , @xmath63 will typically show a very erratic behaviour ( large variance ) and will be prone to exploding ( large positive bias ) , especially in the corners of @xmath23 in which @xmath16 is large .\nfigure [ fig : naivecopdens ] illustrates these problems , from a typical sample of size @xmath151 simulated from the gaussian copula with correlation @xmath152 ( left panel ) .\nthe corresponding naive probit - transformation kernel estimator is shown in the middle panel .\nan unconstrained matrix @xmath153 was used in ( [ eqn : fsthat])/([eqn : naivefeas ] ) and chosen by the multivariate normal reference rule @xcite . here\n, this is optimal : @xmath0 being a gaussian copula , @xmath51 is a bivariate normal density . over the middle of the unit square , the estimator appears to work decently , but towards the boundaries the estimate shows coarse folds and , indeed , hypertrophies the peaks in the corners @xmath154 an @xmath155 . clearly , this estimator is not acceptable as - is .\nit is , therefore , not surprising that it has been reported not to perform well , see for instance the simulation study in @xcite .\nthe third , unbounded term in ( [ eqn : biaschat ] ) can , however , be easily adjusted for . instead of ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) ,\ntake @xmath156 for this ` amended ' version of @xmath63 , one can see that the asymptotic bias becomes proportional to @xmath157 in fact , the deterministic , multiplicative amendment in ( [ eqn : amendnaive ] ) exactly makes it up for the third term in ( [ eqn : biaschat ] ) in the asymptotic development , given that @xmath158 as @xmath159 .\nthe improvement is illustrated in figure [ fig : naivecopdens ] ( right panel ) , where the amended version of the naive estimator computed on the same data set as in the middle panel is shown .\nthe peaks in the corners @xmath154 and @xmath155 are now roughly of the right height . on the other hand ,\nthe wiggly appearance of the estimate along boundaries mostly remains , as the variance is not affected by the deterministic amendment . on a side note\n, the amendment implies that the estimator @xmath160 does not integrate to one over the unit square any more , which calls for a renormalisation such as @xmath161 .\nthis is , however , frequent in other nonparametric density estimation procedures , and is not really a problem .\nnow the asymptotic properties of the ` improved ' versions of the probit -

linear estimator @xmath175 attempts a correction for the slopes of @xmath16 like in ( [ eqn : corrslope ] ) , it actively acts on the boundary behaviour as well .\nindeed , given that @xmath183 and @xmath184 tend to 0 towards 0 and 1 , the first four terms in the bracket in the previous expression will have little influence towards the boundaries ( provided @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply there ) . on the other hand , @xmath185 tends to @xmath186 very fast along boundaries ( and all the more in the corners ) , hence @xmath187 is multiplied by something quickly tending to 0 there and this prevents it from exploding .\nthis is , in fact , very similar to what the amendment in ( [ eqn : amendnaive ] ) attempted , but is now achieved automatically .\nfigure [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] ( middle panel ) shows the estimate @xmath175 for the data set used in figure [ fig : naivecopdens ] .\nit used the cross - validation criterion discussed in section [ sec : bandwidth ] to select the matrix @xmath76 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) .\nthe second improved probit - transformation estimator is obtained when taking @xmath87 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) .\nagain , consider first the ` ideal ' estimator @xmath188 , computed on the genuine sample @xmath189 . locally fitting a polynomial of a higher degree\nis known to reduce the asymptotic bias of the estimator , here from order @xmath190 to order @xmath191 @xcite , sufficient smoothness of @xmath51 permitting .\nspecifically , if @xmath51 admits continuous fourth - order partial derivatives and is positive at @xmath67 , then @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 with @xmath195 . starting from @xmath196 , tedious algebraic differentiation provides all partial derivatives of @xmath197 up to order four in terms of @xmath16 and its partial derivatives up to order four .\nnaturally , @xmath16 will be assumed to admit continuous fourth - order partial derivatives .\n[ ass : cop4 ] the copula density @xmath198 admits continuous fourth - order partial derivatives on the interior of the unit square @xmath23 .    as previously , it readily follows from ( [ eqn : normfsttilde2 ] ) that @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is an expression of the same type as ( [ eqn : biasctilde1 ] ) , this time involving the partial derivatives of @xmath16 up to the fourth order .\nlike above , it can be shown that resorting to pseudo - observations does not affect these properties .\nthis , however , requires a condition on the bandwidth ( @xmath202 ) slightly stronger than previously .\ngiven that the bias order is reduced to @xmath191 , the optimal bandwidth order is now seen to be @xmath203 , so that the bandwidth requirement does still include that optimal order .\n[ thm : ctilde2 ] under the assumptions of proposition [ thm : fshat ] and assumption [ ass : cop4 ] , if @xmath123 with @xmath204 as @xmath74 , the ` improved ' local log - quadratic probit - transformation kernel copula density estimator @xmath205 at any @xmath59 is such that @xmath206 where @xmath201 and @xmath207 are described above .\nsee appendix .    for seek of conciseness\n, the expression of @xmath201 is not given here ( it is made up of several dozens of terms ) .\nthe interesting point about it , though , is that , unlike ( [ eqn : biasctilde1 ] ) which shows a last term @xmath208 , all terms of @xmath201 are proportional to @xmath209 , for some non - negative integral powers @xmath210 , and all those functions tend to 0 as @xmath211 .\nhence , @xmath201 may actually tend to 0 towards the boundaries , and the bias there be actually of order @xmath212 .\nagain , this will be the case where @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply when approaching the boundary .\nthe expression of the variance is the same as that for @xmath213 and @xmath214 , except that it has been inflated by a factor @xmath215 .\nthis inflation factor is , also , a well - known feature in local polynomial modelling when fitting a higher - degree polynomial ( * ? ? ?\n* section 3.3.1 ) .\ninterestingly , _\ntechniques for reducing the bias of kernel estimators from @xmath190 to @xmath191 , e.g.  higher - order kernels or multiplicative adjustment , have long been an active research topic @xcite . yet , few of those methods have actually taken hold .\nthe main reason is that the demonstrated improvement is an asymptotic result , which usually goes unnoticed for sample sizes one typically has in practice while implying interpretability issues ( e.g.  negative density estimates when using higher - order kernels ) and computational burden .\nit is , therefore , worth stressing that here combining probit transformation and local log - quadratic density estimation in the @xmath47-domain achieves that bias reduction with no real extra complications compared to other estimators and fixes the boundary bias in an automatic way .\nfurthermore , these improvements are visible even in moderately large sample size , as the simulation study in section [ sec : sim ] will show .\nthe most obvious and practically relevant effect of this bias reduction is that a larger bandwidth can be used without oversmoothing .\nthis results in smoother estimates , visually more pleasant .\nthis is clear in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] ( right panel ) , where @xmath205 is shown for the same data set as previously .\nagain , the bandwidth matrix in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) was chosen via the cross - validation method suggested in section [ sec : bandwidth ] .\ntheorems [ thm : ctilde1 ] and [ thm : ctilde2 ] reveal that the combination of probit transformation and local likelihood methods mostly cures the boundary bias problems for kernel copula density estimation .\nhowever , the fact remains that the suggested estimators have a variance behaving like @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 , as @xmath74 .\nhence , @xmath220 tends to grow unboundedly when @xmath145 approaches one of the boundaries .\nnote that this is also the case for other copula density estimators attempting to correct the boundary bias , see for instance ( * ? ? ?\n* chapter 4 ) and @xcite who obtain similar unbounded boundary variance for the beta kernel and the bernstein estimators .\nfacing the same situation in the univariate case , @xcite suggested to use @xmath216-nearest - neighbor ( @xmath216-nn ) type bandwidth in the transformed domain .\nalthough barely used for standard kernel density estimation , @xmath216-nn bandwidths appeared totally appropriate in @xcite s framework and , indeed , managed to stabilise the variance towards the boundaries .\nthis is also the case in this setting as can be understood heuristically as follows .\nagain , assume that the smoothing matrix @xmath76 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is diagonal , but instead of taking @xmath162 for some fixed value @xmath221 , take a local smoothing matrix defined as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the euclidean distance between @xmath67 and the @xmath216th closest observation out of the sample ( [ eqn : pseudosamp ] ) in @xmath50 .\nnow it is @xmath216 , or equivalently @xmath224 , that will play the role of the smoothing parameter in lieu of @xmath221 .\nif @xmath24 had a compact support , @xmath225 would be the proportion of observations actively entering the estimation of @xmath51 at any @xmath67  the interpretation roughly holds for the gaussian kernel as well .\nof course , @xmath223 depends on the sample and is a random quantity .\nalong the same lines as in @xcite , one can show that @xmath226 and , together with @xmath227 , that @xmath228 now , through ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , one directly gets , for all @xmath59 , @xmath229 unlike ( [ eqn : varinf ] ) , this is no more proportional to @xmath230 which grows unboundedly towards boundaries .\nthis results in estimates more stable and much smoother towards the borders of @xmath23 .\nin fact , given that the ( long ) tails of @xmath231 in the transformed domain becomes the ( short ) boundary regions of @xmath232 in @xmath23 through the compressing back - transformation @xmath233 , @xmath231 must have _ very smooth _ tails in @xmath50 to produce suitably smooth boundary behaviour for @xmath232 .\nthis is exactly what is achieved by using a @xmath216-nn bandwidth in the @xmath47-domain : local likelihood density estimators using @xmath216-nn bandwidth are , indeed , known to produce smoother estimates in the tails than their fixed - bandwidth counterparts , avoiding the occurrence of ` spurious bumps ' .\nhence the appropriateness of the method here .\nthis is illustrated in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] .\nagain , the previous simulated data set was used to produce the two ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimates shown in the middle ( local log - linear ) and the right panel ( local log - quadratic ) , but this time a @xmath216-nn - type unconstrained bandwidth matrix @xmath234 was used ( see section 4 for details ) .\ncompared to figure [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] , the estimates are much smoother along the boundaries now .\nfor instance , using a @xmath216-nn - bandwidth mostly corrects the kink previously observed in the @xmath235 corner .\nit is particularly clear for @xmath205 .\nthe value of @xmath225 selected for the case @xmath86 was 0.1871 , that for the case @xmath87 was 0.4976 .\nagain , the bias order reduction implied by local log - quadratic modelling allows a larger smoothing parameter to be used . as a result , this estimate @xmath205 ( right panel ) has a smooth and visually pleasant appearance , but without oversmoothing .\nin fact , it is barely distinguishable from the true copula density ( left panel ) .\nit happens that the estimator @xmath205 , when used in conjunction with a @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth , is strikingly good at recovering the shape of the underlying copula density while maintaining a visually pleasant amount of smoothness , see also section [ sec : realdat ] .\nthe behaviour of kernel estimators is known to be crucially dependent on their smoothing parameter , whose choice in practice is unanimously recognised as a very difficult problem , especially in more than one dimension . here an effective way for selecting a suitable bandwidth matrix @xmath236 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is suggested .\nit can be understood that the diagonal elements @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath76 quantify the amount of smoothing applied in the directions of the main @xmath55- and @xmath13-axes , hence their values will drive the overall smoothness of the resulting estimate @xmath239 and eventually that of @xmath232 . on the other hand\n, @xmath240 sets the direction along which that smoothing mostly takes place in @xmath50 .\nfor instance , if @xmath24 is the bivariate gaussian kernel , the local weights around @xmath83 will be set by the elliptical contour lines of the @xmath241-distribution .\nif @xmath51 is stretched along a particular direction of @xmath50 , which will be the case if @xmath16 itself is so on the unit square , it is greatly beneficial to the estimator that smoothing be applied in that direction @xcite , and so @xmath240 should be selected accordingly . if this is not the case , in particular if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are uncorrelated , then @xmath240 may be set to 0 .\nthis motivates to separate the problem of selecting @xmath242 and @xmath243 from that of selecting @xmath240 .\nthe idea developed here looks for achieving this , in a way close in spirit to pre - sphering the observations ( * ? ? ?\n* section 4.6 ) .    consider the principal components decomposition of the @xmath244-`data matrix ' @xmath245 . by construction , the @xmath246 s and @xmath247 s\nare centred , hence @xmath248 and @xmath249 , the score of the @xmath250th observation on the first and second principal components , are given by @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are the eigenvectors of @xmath254 .\ngiven that the transformation @xmath255 is only a linear reparametrisation of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 .\nin addition , it is well known that the samples @xmath258 and @xmath259 are uncorrelated , hence estimating @xmath257 via any kernel method from the sample @xmath260 can be based on a diagonal bandwidth matrix @xmath261 with little side effect .\nan idea is then to select @xmath262 and @xmath263 independently via univariate procedures .\ndenote @xmath264 and @xmath265 ( @xmath93 ) , the local log - polynomial estimators for the density of @xmath266 and @xmath267 , respectively , based on the samples @xmath258 and @xmath259 ( see equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) in @xcite ) .\nof course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath262 and @xmath265 only depends on another bandwidth @xmath263 . then , @xmath262 can be selected via cross - validation ( * ? ? ?\n* section 5.3.3 ) as @xmath268 where , as usual in cross - validation procedures , @xmath269 is the ` leave - one - out ' version of @xmath270 computed on all the observations but @xmath248 .\nthe value of @xmath263 can be found similarly , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 can be plugged into @xmath271 for proceeding to bivariate estimation\n. however , optimal bandwidths for univariate density estimation are usually smaller than those for bivariate density estimation of @xmath257 . for the case\n@xmath86 ( local log - linear estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath272 for univariate density estimation and @xmath273 in two dimensions . for the case\n@xmath87 ( local log - quadratic estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath274 for univariate density estimation and @xmath275 in two dimensions .\nhence , a fair choice for the bandwidth matrix for estimating @xmath257 seems to be @xmath276 with @xmath262 and @xmath263 the two bandwidths found above by ( univariate ) cross - validation , and @xmath277 in the local log - linear case and @xmath278 in the local log - quadratic case .\nthe estimate of @xmath51 can finally be obtained by linear back - transformation of the estimate of @xmath257 from the @xmath256-domain to the @xmath47 domain .\nit must be noted , though , that , again due to ( [ eqn : linequiv ] ) , this exactly amounts to directly estimating @xmath51 from @xmath82 using the bandwidth matrix @xmath279 when the estimator is to be built on a @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix , the procedure is very similar .\nthe data are transformed into the sample @xmath260 via ( [ eqn : pca ] ) .\nthen , a suitable value of @xmath225 in the @xmath266-direction is computed as @xmath280 i.e.  exactly as in ( [ eqn : hcv ] ) but this time @xmath264 is the estimator based on the @xmath216-nn bandwidth @xmath225 . the value @xmath281 is computed in the same way .\ndenote @xmath282 .\nthen , the squared norm of a vector in the @xmath256-domain will be computed as @xmath283 the factor @xmath284 naturally adjusts , through the obtained close - to - optimal values of @xmath285 and @xmath281 , for the potential discrepancy in local geometry in the @xmath286- and @xmath287-directions .\nthe bivariate estimation of @xmath257 at any @xmath288 is carried out using the @xmath289 nearest neighbours of @xmath290 , these being determined by the above distance . here , @xmath291 and @xmath292 , again for accounting for the difference in optimal @xmath225-orders in one and two dimensions .\nfinally , the estimate of @xmath51 is obtained by inverse linear transformation or , as set out in the fixed - bandwidth case , directly from the sample @xmath82 using an appropriate mahalanobis - like distance .\nthe main difference is that here , the employed distance makes use , through @xmath293 in ( [ eqn : distkappa ] ) , of relevant information in terms of optimal smoothing , not only in terms of the covariance structure of @xmath294 like the usual mahalanobis distance . in this\nsetting , the ` smoothing parameters ' vector is , therefore , @xmath295 .\nit is acknowledged that this procedure may lack of sufficient theoretical support .\nfor instance , it is known that pre - sphering the observations in the process of selecting the bandwidth matrix is justified only if the underlying density @xmath51 is bivariate normal , that is , in this framework , if @xmath16 is the gaussian copula .\nlikewise , choosing @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( or @xmath285 and @xmath281 ) independently via univariate procedures would be suitable in theory only if @xmath266 and @xmath267 were independent , not only uncorrelated .\nthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a heuristic , _ ad - hoc _ correction . having said this , it was found that this way of doing gave very reliable results , as illustrated in figures [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] and [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ]\n. this will be even more obvious in the simulation study and the real data analysis detailed in the next sections .\nin addition , the suggested procedure , based on a twofold univariate cross - validation optimisation problem , is more stable numerically than one based on optimising a full , bivariate cross - validation criterion .\nthis technique seems , therefore , an acceptable choice for selecting the bandwidth matrix in practice .\nhere , monte carlo simulations results are presented to compare the practical behaviour of the probit - transformation estimators with that of their main competitors .\nall computations have been carried out using the r software and its freely available packages .\nspecifically , 12 estimators were considered :    * the ` mirror reflection ' estimator , denoted @xmath297 below , as suggested in @xcite .\nit was the first attempt at nonparametric copula density estimation , and remains a common choice for ( ostensibly ) correcting boundary bias .\nit will , therefore , be taken as benchmark .\na first bandwidth matrix was obtained from the ` augmented ' data set ( made up of @xmath298 ` observations ' spread over an area 9 times bigger than @xmath23 ) via the normal reference rule , then the final matrix was obtained by multiplying the former by @xmath299 for adjusting for the effective sample size and range ; * the ` naive ' probit - transformation estimator @xmath300 ( [ eqn : naivefeas ] ) and its amended version @xmath301 , whose idea is exposed in section [ subsec : naive ] ( for a general , non - diagonal matrix @xmath76 , the amendment takes a slightly more complicated form than ( [ eqn : amendnaive ] ) ) . the bandwidth matrix @xmath76 was selected via a direct plug - in method @xcite in the transformed domain @xmath47 ; * the improved probit - transformation estimators @xmath302 and @xmath303 , given by ( [ eqn : impctilde ] ) , based on a @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix selected via cross - validation as described at the end of section [ sec : bandwidth ] .\nas already observed in @xcite in the univariate case , when based on a fixed - bandwidth matrix these estimators performed a little less well , so the results are not shown here .\nthe optimisation problems ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) ( local log - polynomial estimation of @xmath51 ) and ( [ eqn : alphacv ] ) ( @xmath216-nn bandwidth selection ) were solved using the relevant functions of the r package locfit .\na r package directly implementing these improved probit - transformation estimators is in preparation ; * the beta kernel estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath304 , with @xcite s further bias correction .\ntwo smoothing parameters were considered : @xmath305 ( @xmath306 ) and @xmath307 ( @xmath308 ) ; * the bernstein copula density estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath309 .\ntwo smoothing parameters were considered : @xmath310 ( @xmath311 ) and @xmath312 ( @xmath313 ) ; * the penalised hierarchical @xmath314-splines estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath315 , computed by the function pencopula in the eponymous r package .\nthe vector of penalty coefficients was set to @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) , @xmath318 ( @xmath319 ) , and @xmath320 ( @xmath321 ) .\nthe parameters @xmath322 and @xmath323 were set to @xmath324 and @xmath325 , according to @xcite s simulations study .\n@xmath326 independent random samples @xmath36 of sizes @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath151 were generated from each of the following copulas :    * the independence copula ( i.e. , @xmath134 s and @xmath135 s drawn independently ) ; * the gaussian copula , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the student @xmath13-copula with 10 degrees of freedom , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the student @xmath13-copula with 4 degrees of freedom , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the frank copula , with parameter @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 ; * the gumbel copula , with parameter @xmath335 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 ; * the clayton copula , with parameter @xmath338 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 .    for each family of copulas ,\nthe considered three values of the parameter roughly correspond to kendall s @xmath339 s equal to 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 , respectively .\nof course , all the estimations only made use of the pseudo - observations , i.e.  the normalised ranks of the observations in the initially generated samples @xmath340 and @xmath341 .    in order to assess the quality of the fit of an estimator @xmath342 for a given copula density @xmath16 , the mean integrated @xmath343-error @xmath344 was estimated by the average over the @xmath326 monte carlo replications of @xmath345 with @xmath346 .\nthe approximated mise can be found in tables [ tab : l2:square-200 ] , [ tab : l2:square-500 ] and [ tab : l2:square-1000 ] for the three considered sample sizes .\nnote that , for ease of reading and interpretation , all the values are relative to the ( approximated ) mise of the benchmark mirror estimator @xmath297 . for reference ,\nthe effective mise of @xmath297 is reported in italics in the last column of the table ( which is , therefore , not on the same scale as the other values ) .\n.(approximated ) mise relative to the mise of the mirror - reflection estimator ( last column ) , @xmath327 .\nbold values show the minimum mise for the corresponding copula ( non - significantly different values are highlighted as well ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it turns out that the estimators @xmath175 and @xmath205 are clearly the best , overall , on this @xmath347-error criterion , and this for all sample sizes .\nthey always dramatically improve on the beta and bernstein estimators , and they also do much better than the mirror reflection and the penalised b - splines estimators when the dependence is not close to null .\nwhen the depence is very low , @xmath348 and @xmath349 do better , which can be easily understood .\nit is well known that the mirror reflection estimator efficiently deals with boundary effects only when the partial derivatives of @xmath16 are 0 there ( ` shoulder ' ) .\nit is , therefore , particularly appropriate for the independence copula ( @xmath350 ) and other very flat copula densities such as gaussian or frank with low dependence .\nthe penalised b - splines estimator does even better when using a huge penalty for roughness , for obvious reasons . in all other cases , and particularly when the copula density becomes unbounded in some corners ( but not only ) , @xmath175 and @xmath205 dramatically outperform their competitors .\nin fact , mirror reflection and splines are not appropriate methods for estimating unbounded copula densities , and this is a real problem given that those are the most interesting cases in practice . by construction\n, the beta kernel estimator always tends to be zero along boundaries ( see for instance figure [ fig : loss - alae - comp ] below ) , hence its even worse performance in this framework .\nthe bernstein estimator does better than @xmath351 , but can not really compete with @xmath175 and @xmath205 . of course\n, one can argue that the smoothing parameters used for @xmath351 , @xmath352 and @xmath349 have been selected mostly arbitrarily and are not adequate .\nthis may be true , however , there is no simple , data - driven way of selecting those parameters , hence the choice was made subjectively exactly as a practitioner should have resolved to act .\nin addition , the above observations support that bad smoothing parameter choice is not the only reason for the poor performance of some of those estimators\n. other evidence of that will be given in the next section on a real data set .\nin general , the local log - quadratic estimator @xmath205 is doing better than the local log - linear @xmath175 , which was expected from the theoretical results . a notable exception ,\nthough , is in presence of high tail dependence , i.e.  when the copula density tends very quickly to @xmath353 at one of the corners of @xmath23 , such as for clayton and gumbel copulas with high kendall s @xmath339 .\nin fact , the extra smoothness guaranteed by local log - quadratic estimation tends to prevent the estimator from growing too quickly in the corners , and this is thus slightly detrimental in those cases .\nthe same comment holds true when comparing the naive estimator @xmath63 to its amended version @xmath354 .\ngenerally , @xmath354 has lower mise than @xmath63 , except in the above - mentioned cases of high tail dependence .\nindeed , the amendment prevents the estimate from exploding , even when the true density does . in any case\n, these ` naive ' versions can not really match the performance of the ` improved ' versions @xmath175 and @xmath205 on mise , not to mention that their visual appearance is by far less pleasant .\nfinally , other criteria were considered for comparing the different estimators , such as @xmath355-error on the square @xmath356 , @xmath355- and @xmath347-error on the first diagonal ( @xmath357 ) and on a side ( @xmath358 ) of @xmath23 , or @xmath355- and @xmath347-error at a given point in one of the corners of @xmath23 ( @xmath359 ) .\nthese results are available on request from the authors .\nall show , to the same extent as above , the superiority of the improved probit - transformation estimators over their competitors .\nin this section the well - known ` loss - alae ' dataset , reporting the indemnity payment ( @xmath360 s ) and allocated loss adjustment expense ( @xmath361 s ) associated to @xmath362 losses from an insurance company , is considered .\nanalysed in @xcite and @xcite , this dataset has since then become a classic in the copula literature .\nin particular , @xcite mentioned that the gumbel copula with @xmath363 provides an excellent fit .\nthe data set initially contains 34 censored observations , that were excluded here as the suggested estimators were not designed to take censorship into account . using more advanced model selection ideas\n, @xcite also found that the gumbel copula ( with the same parameter @xmath364 ) fits the dataset ( restricted to its complete cases ) the best out of most of the usual parametric copula models .\nthe aim here is to test the probit -

left corner of @xmath23 is much less endowed in data than the bottom - right corner ) , and not on any prior assumption . on the contrary ,\nthe gumbel copula density is inherently symmetric in @xmath368 and @xmath369 .\nthe peak in the density at @xmath154 also appears less high on the nonparametric estimates than on the gumbel copula density .\nfigure [ fig : loss -

type methods for nonparametric copula modelling have been delayed owing mainly to the bounded support of copulas , namely the unit square @xmath23 .\nit is , indeed , well known that kernel estimators heavily suffer from boundary bias issues , which are not trivial to fix . in this paper ,\na new kernel - type estimator for the copula density has been proposed .\nit is based on the probit - transformation idea suggested in @xcite and studied in full in the univariate case in @xcite .\nthis ` improved probit - transformation estimator ' deals with boundary bias in a very natural way .\nin addition , it has been seen to easily cope with potentially unbounded copula densities , which are the common and interesting cases in copula modelling .\nan easy - to - implement selection rule for the necessary smoothing parameters has also been proposed .\nthis procedure has been seen to be very stable and to give very good results in practice . in particular ,\na version of the estimator ( @xmath375 with @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix ) is able to reproduce the smooth and pleasant appearance of parametric models , while keeping the flexibility of fully nonparametric estimation procedures .\na comprehensive simulation study has emphasised the very good practical performance of that estimator compared to its main competitors .\nseveral important points remain to be studied , though .\nfirst , as of now , the theoretical properties of the estimator have been derived under the assumption of i.i.d .\nsampling , making use of the strong approximation for the empirical copula process provided by proposition 4.2 of @xcite . to the best of these authors knowledge\n, this result has not been proved in the case of weakly dependent observations .\nit would be particularly significant to investigate this in a near future , given the predominant place recently found by copula modelling in the setting of time series , notably in finance .\nother directions for future research would look for using the new copula density estimator in a variety of problems , for instance copula goodness - of - fit tests @xcite or nonparametric conditional density estimation @xcite . finally , it must be said that , in theory , the idea presented in this paper is not bound to the bivariate case but extends in a straightforward way to higher dimensional copulas as well .\nof course , in practice , this is wise only within the limits allowed by the _ curse of dimensionality_.\nthe first author was supported by a faculty research grant from the faculty of science , university of new south wales ( australia ) .\nthe second author acknowledges additional funding provided by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .\nthe third author was supported by an a.r.c .\ncontract from the _ communaut franaise de belgique _ and by the iap research network grant nr .\np7/06 of the belgian government ( belgian science policy ) .\nfirst a technical lemma , which may be of interest of its own , is stated .      from assumption [ ass : copdens ] ,\none easily obtains that , for all @xmath59 , @xmath377 in particular , when approaching the @xmath154-corner , the above implies that @xmath378 for some constant @xmath379 ( and similar towards the boundaries and the other corners of @xmath23 ) .\nnow , applying theorem 1 of @xcite , one can show that this implies that , for @xmath380 s.t .\n@xmath381 , there exist constants @xmath382 such that @xmath383 ( and again , similar results hold at boundaries and at the other corners of @xmath23 ) . given that @xmath17 is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable everywhere on the interior of @xmath23 ( i.e. , @xmath17 and all its mixed partial derivatives of the first two orders can only go unbounded towards the boundaries of @xmath23 ) , this allows one to write that , there exist @xmath384 and bounded constants @xmath385 such that @xmath386 for all @xmath59 . then , ( [ eqn : unb ] ) in ( [ eqn : fst ] ) yields @xmath387 for all @xmath83 .\ngiven that , from the known properties of the normal distribution , @xmath388 is bounded for any constant @xmath389 , there exists a constant @xmath390 such that @xmath391 .\nnow from ( [ eqn : firstderfst ] ) one can write @xmath392 from ( [ eqn : unb ] ) and ( [ eqn : derivunb ] ) with @xmath393 , @xmath394 , one gets @xmath395 take @xmath396 and see that , as above , @xmath397 is bounded , so that the first term is uniformly bounded on @xmath50 .\nthe second term is uniformly bounded as well , as @xmath398 is also bounded for any @xmath389 .\nall second - order partial derivatives of @xmath51 can be uniformly bounded in the exact same way using ( [ eqn : derivunb ] ) in ( [ eqn : secondderfst ] ) and similar .\ndenote @xmath399 i.e.  the ` ideal ' version of the empirical copula ( [ eqn : empcop ] ) using genuine observations @xmath30 s , and the corresponding empirical process @xmath400 , with @xmath401 also , define the process @xmath402 with @xmath403 @xcite shows that , under assumptions [ ass : fxy]-[ass : copdens ] , the empirical copula process @xmath404 ( see ( [ eqn : limitempcop ] ) ) and @xmath405 are such that @xmath406    now , see that @xmath407 integrating by parts , as in the proof of theorem 6 of @xcite , one gets @xmath408 where @xmath409 given that @xmath410 and the conditions on the bandwidth @xmath221 . call @xmath411 so that @xmath412 plugging ( [ eqn : gn ] ) in ( [ eqn : gn2 ] ) yields @xmath413 the process @xmath414 being the bivariate empirical process based on genuine observations\n, @xmath415 is , in fact , @xmath416 , for which classical kernel smoothing theory states that @xmath417 the terms @xmath418 and @xmath419 can be worked out explicitly .\nthis is done below for @xmath418 only ( @xmath419 can be treated in the exact same way ) .\nwrite @xmath420 and proceed with @xmath421 with the change of variable @xmath422 . as @xmath423 ,\nthis is also @xmath424 taylor - expanding , one gets @xmath425 where @xmath426 , of which only odd powers of @xmath427 will remain in ( [ eqn : psiu ] ) as @xmath428 is an odd function .\nhence , @xmath429 since @xmath430 , denoting @xmath431 .\nit follows that @xmath432 the change of variable @xmath433 yields @xmath434 where @xmath435 are both between @xmath436 and @xmath221 .\nthe first term in this decomposition is 0 , as @xmath428 is an odd function .\nthe second term tends to 0 as @xmath437 .\nthis is because @xmath438 is nothing else than a usual univariate uniform empirical process .\n@xcite studied its modulus of continuity and their theorem 3.1(b ) allows one to write , under these assumptions , @xmath439,|u -

observations does not change the statistical properties of that estimator of @xmath474 .\nhence @xmath476 ( and same for the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath13 ) .\nit follows that @xmath477 . with the factor @xmath478 in ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) , this means that the second term is of order @xmath479 , which is obviously @xmath464 . then , @xmath480 and since this order carries over to @xmath481 in a straightforward way , ( [ eqn : normctildestar1 ] ) also holds with @xmath214 instead of @xmath482 .\nit is very similar to the proof of theorem [ thm : ctilde1 ] , based on the analogue of ( [ eqn : corrslope ] ) for @xmath483 ( i.e.  the bivariate version of equation ( 5.2 ) in @xcite ) .\nit is , therefore , omitted .\nthe reason why a condition on @xmath221 stronger than previously is needed is that here , the analogue of ( [ eqn : psi ] ) involves the second order partial derivatives of @xmath60 . to have those consistent for the corresponding partial derivatives of @xmath51 , indeed , requires @xmath484 .\n99 autin , f. , le pennec , e.  and tribouley , k.

{"id": "dev_longform_513", "text": "symbiotic stars are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence in an apparently single object of two temperature regimes differing by a factor of 30 or more .\nthe spectrum of a symbiotic star consists of a late type ( m- ) absorption spectrum , highly excited emission lines and a blue continuum .\ngenerally , symbiotic stars are interpreted as interacting binary systems consisting of a cool luminous visual primary and a hot compact object ( white dwarf , subdwarf ) as secondary component .\nbecause of mass loss of the giant there is often a common nebulous envelope .\nmass transfer from the cool to the hot component is expected .\nan extensive review on the properties of symbiotic stars can be found in kenyon ( 1986 ) .\nmany symbiotic stars show outburst events at optical and uv wavelengths .\nthough several models have been proposed to explain these outbursts , it is the combination of quiescent properties and these outburst properties which make it difficult to derive a consistent picture for some symbiotics .\nthe symbiotic star ag draconis ( bd + 67922 ) plays an outstanding role inside this group of stars because of its high galactic latitude , its large radial velocity of v@xmath6=148 km / s and its relatively early spectral type ( k ) .\nag dra is probably a metal poor symbiotic binary in the galactic halo .    here\n, we use all available data to document the x - ray light curve of ag dra over the past 5 years .\nin addition , we report on the results of the coordinated / campaign during the 1994/1995 outbursts .\npreliminary results on the and optical observations were given by viotti ( 1994a , 1994b ) .\nafter a description of the relevant previous knowledge of the ag dra properties in the optical , uv and x - ray range in the remaining part of this paragraph , we present our observational results in paragraph 24 , discuss the various implications on the ag dra system parameters in paragraph 5 and end with a summary in paragraph 6 .\nlike in most symbiotic stars , the historical light curve of ag dra is characterized by a sequence of active and quiescent phases ( e.g. robinson 1969 , viotti 1993 ) .\nthe activity is represented by 12 mag light maxima ( currently called _ outbursts _ or _ eruptions _ ) frequently followed by one or more secondary maxima .\nit has been noted ( robinson 1969 , iijima 1987 ) that the major outbursts occur in @xmath715 yr intervals .\nthis recurrence period has continued with the recent major outbursts of 1981 and 1994 .\niijima ( 1987 ) suggest that the major outbursts seem to occur at about the same orbital phase , shortly after the photometric maximum , i.e. shortly after the spectroscopic conjunction of the companion ( hot component in front of the cool component ) .\noccasionally , ag dra also undergoes smaller amplitude outbursts , such as those in february 1985 and january 1986 .    between the active phases\nag dra is spending long periods ( few years to decades ) at minimum light ( v@xmath79.8 - 10.0 , mattei 1995 ) , with small ( 0.1 mag ) semiregular photometric variations in b and v with pseudo - periods of 300 - 400 days ( luthardt 1990 ) .\nhowever , in the u band regular variations with amplitudes of 1 mag and a period of 554 days have been discovered by meinunger ( 1979 ) , and confirmed by later observations ( e.g. kaler 1987 , hric 1994 , skopal 1994 ) .\nthis periodicity is associated with the orbital motion of the system , as confirmed by the radial velocity observations of kenyon & garcia ( 1986 ) , mikolajewska ( 1995 ) and smith ( 1996 ) .\nbecause of the color dependence these u band variations certainly reflect the modulation of the balmer continuum emission .\nthe photometric variability is continuous , suggesting periodic eclipses of an extended hot region by the red giant .    in june 1994 graslo ( 1994 )\nannounced that ag dra was starting a new active phase which was marked by a rapid brightening from v=9.9 to v=8.4 on june 14th , and to 8.1 on july 6 - 10 , 1994 .\nafter july 1994 the brightness gradually declined reaching the quiescent level ( v@xmath79.8 ) in november 1994 . like the 198182 and 198586 episodes ,\nag dra underwent a secondary outburst in july 1995 , reaching the light maximum of v=8.9 by the end of the month .\nthe optical spectrum of ag dra was largely investigated especially in recent years , during both the active phases and quiescence .\nthe spectrum is typical of a symbiotic star , with a probably stable cool component which dominates the yellow - red region , and a largely variable  nebular \" component with a strong blue - ultraviolet continuum and a rich emission line spectrum ( e.g. boyarchuk 1966 ) . according to most authors\nthe cool component is a k3 giant , which together with its large radial velocity ( 148 km s@xmath8 ) and high galactic latitude ( b@xmath9=+41@xmath10 ) , would place ag dra in the halo population at a distance of about 1.2 kpc , 0.8 kpc above the galactic plane . while huang ( 1994 ) suggested that the cool component of ag dra may be of spectral type k0ib , which would place it at a distance of about 10 kpc , mikolajewska ( 1995 ) from a comparison with the near - infrared colors of m3 and m13 giants concluded that the cool component is a bright giant with m@xmath11 3.5 , placing ag dra at about 2.5 kpc .\nmost recently , smith ( 1996 ) performed a detailed abundance analysis and found a low metallicity ( [ fe / h]=1.3 ) , a temperature of t@xmath12=4300@xmath1100 k and log g = 1.6@xmath10.3 consistent with the classification of ag dra s cool component as an early k giant . in the following\nwe shall assume a distance of 2.5 kpc for the ag dra system .\nthe hot dwarf companion is a source of intense ultraviolet radiation which produces a rich high - temperature emission line spectrum and a strong uv continuum .\nag dra is in fact a very bright uv target which has been intensively studied with ( e.g. viotti 1983 , lutz 1987 , kafatos 1993 , mrset 1991 , mikolajewska 1995 ) .\nultraviolet high - resolution spectra with the satellite revealed high - ionization permitted emission lines such as the resonance doublets of n , c and si .\nthe strongest emission line is he @xmath131640 which is composed of narrow and broad ( fwhm = 6  , or equivalently @xmath71000 km / s ) components .\nthe n line has a p cygni absorption component displaced 120 km / s from the emission peak ( viotti 1983 ) .\nthe origin of this feature is unclear .\nit can either arise in the red - giant wind ionized by the hot dwarf radiation , or in some low - velocity regions of the hot component s wind .\nthe uv continuum and line flux is largely variable with the star s activity .\nviotti ( 1984 ) studied the iue spectra of ag dra during the major 19801983 active phase , and found that the outburst was most energetic in the ultraviolet with an overall rise of about a factor 10 in the continuum , much larger than in the visual , and of a factor 25 in the emission line flux .\na large uv variation was also a characteristics of the minor 1985 and 1986 outbursts ( e.g. mikolajewska 1995 ) .\nfirst x - ray observations of ag dra during the quiescent phase were done with the heao-2 satellite ( observatory ) before the 1981 - 1985 series of eruptions ( 0.27 ipc counts / sec ) .\nthe spectrum was found to be very soft ( anderson 1981 ) .\nthe data are consistent with a blackbody source of kt=0.016 kev ( kenyon 1988 ) in addition to the bremsstrahlung source ( kt=0.1 kev ) suggested by anderson ( 1981 ) .\nthe x - ray temperature of @xmath7  200  000 k is in fair agreement with the source temperature of @xmath7100000150000  k inferred from observations , although the blackbody radius deduced from data is nearly a factor of 10 larger than the x - ray value ( kenyon 1988 ) .\nunfortunately , the major 1980 outburst was  lost \" by the heao-2 satellite because of a failure of the high voltage power .\na comparison of the x - ray flux with the observed he @xmath134686 flux indicates that the luminosity in absorbed he@xmath14 photons is larger by a factor of two ( kenyon 1988 ) .\nit has been concluded that the x - rays are degraded by the surrounding nebula thus causing an underestimate of the actual x - ray luminosity .\nwas pointed on ag dra four times during the 198586 minor active phase , which was characterized by two light maxima in february 1985 and january 1986 .\nthese observations revealed a large x - ray fading with respect to quiescence ( piro 1986 ) , the source being at least 56 times weaker in the exosat thin lexan filter in march 1985 , and not detected in february 1986 ( viotti 1995 ) .\nsimultaneous iue observations have on the contrary shown an increase of the continuum and emission line flux , especially of the high temperature n 1240 a and he 1640 a lines at the time of the light maxima . according to friedjung ( 1988 )\nthis behaviour might be due to a temperature drop of a non - black body component , or to a continuous absorption of the x - rays shortwards of the n@xmath15 ionization limit .\nno eclipse of the x - ray source was found at phase 0.5 ( beginning of november 1985 ) of the orbital motion of the ag dra system , implying a limit in the orbit inclination .\nthe weakness of the countrate in the boron ( filter # 6 ) exosat filter during quiescence implies a low ( 23@xmath210@xmath16 k ) temperature of the source ( piro 1985 ) .\ncccrcr hjd & v & hjd & b   & hjd & u   + & @xmath17(mag)@xmath17 & & @xmath17(mag)@xmath17 & & @xmath17(mag)@xmath17 + 8127.3876 & 9.76 & 8127.3913 & 11.15 & 8127.3991 & 11.77 + 8179.3537 & 9.85 & 8179.3592 & 11.25 & & + 8179.3537 & 9.85 & 8179.3613 & 11.26 & 8179.3696 & 11.66 + 8274.6330 & 9.83 & 8274.6384 & 11.20 & 8274.6432 & 11.37 + 8329.6163 & 9.76 & 8329.6212 & 11.10 & 8329.6265 & 11.32 + 8332.5781 & 9.76 & 8332.5840 & 11.11 & 8332.5908 & 11.34 + 8353.5254 & 9.69 & 8353.5317 & 11.06 & 8353.5380 & 11.36 + 8359.5031 & 9.70 & 8359.5076 & 11.07 & 8359.5135 & 11.31 + 8362.5344 & 9.72 & 8362.5425 & 11.07 & 8362.5498 & 11.33 + 8409.4444 & 9.73 & 8409.4491 & 11.08 & 8409.4544 & 11.28 + 8440.4711 & 9.71 & 8440.4755 & 11.09 & 8440.4809 & 11.43 + 8494.3874 & 9.77 & 8494.3916 & 11.15 & 8494.3978 & 11.67 + 8500.4155 & 9.74 & 8500.4208 & 11.11 & 8500.4275 & 11.64 + 8681.4692 & 9.71 & 8681.4732 & 11.08 & 8681.4785 & 11.54 + 8691.6060 & 9.73 & 8691.6099 & 11.08 & 8691.6153 & 11.59 + 8747.4630 & 9.72 & 8747.4699 & 11.02 & 8747.4767 & 11.33 + 8801.4260 & 9.75 & 8801.4301 & 11.08 & 8801.4362 & 11.35 + 8803.4410 & 9.74 & 8803.4480 & 11.08 & 8803.4540 & 11.33 + 8830.3997 & 9.85 & 8830.4040 & 11.19 & 8830.4107 & 11.41 + 8843.3743 & 9.83 & 8843.3781 & 11.18 & 8843.3831 & 11.31 + 9213.3667 & 9.41 & 9213.3746 & 10.40 & 9213.3818 & 9.89 + 9214.4254 & 9.48 & 9214.4333 & 10.53 & 9214.0000 & 10.42 + 9215.3892 & 9.54 & 9215.3981 & 10.62 & 9215.4061 & 10.28 + 9217.3517 & 9.49 & 9217.3587 & 10.57 & 9217.3648 & 10.15 + 9249.3329 & 9.63 & 9249.3385 & 10.83 & 9249.3448 & 10.56 + 9250.3517 & 9.64 & 9250.3581 & 10.82 & 9250.3639 & 10.54 + 9534.4792 & 8.89 & 9534.4863 & 9.56 & 9534.4931 & 8.60 + 9535.4286 & 8.77 & 9535.4350 & 9.34 & 9535.4419 & 8.43 + 9537.4377 & 8.67 & 9537.4436 & 9.22 & 9537.4494 & 8.32 + 9541.4588 & 8.46 & 9541.4740 & 8.96 & 9541.4790 & 8.04 + 9545.4204 & 8.55 & 9545.4266 & 9.02 & 9545.4327 & 8.15 + 9568.4060 & 8.61 & 9568.4117 & 9.09 & 9568.4182 & 8.30 + 9569.4107 & 8.62 & 9569.4172 & 9.11 & 9569.4229 & 8.28 + 9599.3582 & 8.85 & 9599.3688 & 9.50 & 9599.3760 & 8.72 + 9623.4056 & 9.06 & 9623.4124 & 9.78 & 9623.4187 & 9.07 + 9625.4310 & 9.07 & 9625.4376 & 9.80 & 9625.4438 & 9.09 + 9638.3671 & 9.17 & 9638.3732 & 9.92 & 9638.3791 & 9.19 + 9639.3749 & 9.15 & 9639.3824 & 9.96 & 9639.3885 & 9.25 + 9644.4397 & 9.19 & 9644.4462 & 9.97 & 9644.4544 & 9.20 +    [ phot ]    cccr hjd & m@xmath18 & hjd & m@xmath18   + & ( mag ) & & ( mag)@xmath17 + 9002.317 & 10.6 & 9476.471 & 10.6 + 9005.310 & 10.6 & 9476.491 & 10.5 + 9027.258 & 10.6 & 9476.491 & 10.4 + 9028.259 & 10.5 & 9480.480 & 10.6 + 9029.263 & 10.7 & 9480.480 & 10.5 + 9030.298 & 10.7 & 9480.480 & 10.5 + 9031.303 & 10.5 & 9481.488 & 10.5 + 9032.300 & 10.8 & 9481.488 & 10.4 + 9041.276 & 10.8 & 9481.488 & 10.6 + 9066.531 & 11.0 & 9482.487 & 10.5 + 9094.472 & 11.0 & 9482.487 & 10.5 + 9094.472 & 10.5 & 9482.487 & 10.4 + 9098.500 & 11.0 & 9484.494 & 10.4 + 9098.500 & 10.7 & 9484.494 & 10.4 + 9099.486 & 11.0 & 9484.494 & 10.5 + 9099.486 & 10.9 & 9486.456 & 10.5 + 9101.507 & 11.0 & 9486.456 & 10.3 + 9101.507 & 10.9 & 9486.456 & 10.4 + 9154.458 & 11.0 & 9488.493 & 10.5 + 9154.458 & 10.9 & 9488.493 & 10.5 + 9249.496 & 10.8 & 9488.493 & 10.5 + 9250.487 & 10.6 & 9504.419 & 9.4 + 9278.519 & 10.5 & 9511.453 & 9.2 + 9279.468 & 10.5 & 9518.458 & 9.1 + 9310.486 & 10.7 & 9535.417 & 9.0 + 9416.304 & 10.5 & 9536.422 & 9.0 + 9422.549 & 10.7 & 9537.423 & 8.9 + 9422.549 & 10.7 & 9541.415 & 8.9 + 9422.549 & 10.6 & 9574.422 & 8.7 + 9457.489 & 10.5 & 9836.477 & 10.0 + 9457.499 & 10.5 & 9839.479 & 10.0 + 9457.499 & 10.5 & 9840.483 & 10.2 + 9458.517 & 10.5 & 9841.511 & 10.3 + 9458.517 & 10.4 & 9842.522 & 10.1 + 9458.517 & 10.6 & 9862.443 & 10.1 + 9462.550 & 10.5 & 9888.422 & 10.3 + 9462.550 & 10.4 & 9889.422 & 10.0 + 9462.550 & 10.6 & 9894.422 & 9.9 + 9475.478 & 10.5 & 9895.422 & 9.8 + 9475.478 & 10.4 & 9896.417 & 9.9 + 9475.478 & 10.6 & & +    [ shue ]\nag dra is included in a long -

axis . during the last observation of ag dra with the pspc in the focal plane ( already as a too ) the boron filter was erroneously left in front of the pspc after a scheduled calibration observation .    for each pointed observation with the pspc in the focal plane , x - ray photons\nhave been extracted within 3 of the centroid position .\nthis relatively large size of the extraction circle was chosen because the very soft photons ( below channel 20 ) have a much larger spread in their measured detector coordinates .\nas usual , the background was determined from a ring well outside the source ( there are no other x - ray sources within 5 of ag dra ) . before subtraction ,\nthe background photons were normalized to the same area as the source extraction area .    when ag dra was reported to go into outburst ( granslo 1994 ) we immediately proposed for a target of opportunity observation ( too ) with rosat .\nag dra was scheduled to be observed during the last week of regular pspc observations on july 7 , 1994 , but due to star tracker problems no photons were collected .\nfor all the later observations only the hri could be used after the pspc gas has been almost completely exhausted .\nconsequently , no spectral information is available for these observations .\nthe first hri observation took place on august 28 , 1994 , about 4 weeks after the optical maximum .\nall the following hri observations and the single pspc observation with the boron filter ( described above ) were performed as too to determine the evolution of the x - ray emission after the first outburst . with the knowledge of the results of the first outburst the frequency of observations was increased for the second optical outburst .\nsource photons of the hri observations have been extracted within 1 and were background and vignetting corrected in the standard manner using exsas tasks . in order to compare the hri intensities of with those measured with the pspc we use a pspc / hri countrate ratio for ag dra with its supersoft x - ray spectrum of 7.8 as described in greiner ( 1996 ) .\nwe derive a best - fit x - ray position from the on - axis hri pointing 180073 of r.a .\n( 2000.0 ) = 1601408 , decl .\n( 2000.0 ) = 664808 with an error of @xmath18 .\nthis position is only 2 off the optical position of ag dra ( r.a .\n( 2000.0 ) = 16014094 , decl .\n( 2000.0 ) = 6648097 ) .      the mean rosat pspc countrate of ag dra during the all - sky survey was determined ( as described in paragraph 4.1.1 ) to ( 0.99@xmath10.15 ) cts\nsimilar countrates were detected in several pspc pointings during the quiescent time interval 19911993 .\nthe x - ray light curve of as deduced from the all - sky - survey data taken in 1990 , and 11 pspc pointings ( mean countrate over each pointing ) as well as 7 hri pointings taken between 1991 and 1996 is shown in fig .\n[ light ] .\nthe countrates of the hri pointings have been converted with a factor of 7.8 ( see paragraph 4.1.2 ) and are also included in fig .\n[ light ] .\nthis 5 yrs x - ray light curve displays several features :    1 .\nthe x - ray intensity has been more or less constant between 1990 and the last observation ( may 1993 ) before the optical outburst .\nusing the mean best fit blackbody model with kt = 14.5 ev and the galactic column density n@xmath0 = 3.15@xmath210@xmath38 @xmath31 ( fixed during the fit , see below ) , the unabsorbed intensity in the rosat band ( 0.12.4 kev ) is 1.2@xmath210@xmath39 erg @xmath31 s@xmath8 .\n2 .   during the times of the optical outbursts\nthe observed x - ray flux drops substantially .\nthe observed maximum amplitude of the intensity decrease is nearly a factor of 100 . with the lowest intensity measurement being an upper limit , the true amplitude is certainly even larger . due to the poor sampling\nwe can not determine whether the amplitudes of the two observed x - ray intensity drops are similar .\n3 .   between the two x - ray minima the x - ray intensity nearly reached the pre - outburst level ,\ni.e. the relaxation of whatever parameter caused these drops was nearly complete .\nwe should , however , note that the relaxation to the pre - outburst level was faster at optical wavelength than at x - rays , and also was faster in the b band than in the u band . in december 1994\nthe optical v brightness ( @xmath795 ) was nearly back to the pre - outburst magnitude , while the x - ray intensity was still a factor of 2 lower than before the outburst .\n4 .   the quiescent x - ray light curve shows two small , but significant intensity drops in may 1992 and april / may 1993 .\nthe latter and deeper dip coincides with the orbital minimum in the u lightcurve ( meinunger 1979 , skopal 1994 ) and might suggest a periodic , orbital flux variation .      for spectral fitting of the all - sky - survey data the photons in the amplitude channels 11240 ( though there are almost no photons above channel 50 )\nwere binned with a constant signal / noise ratio of 9@xmath35 .\nthe fit of a blackbody model with all parameters left free results in an effective temperature of kt@xmath40 = 11 ev ( see tab .\n[ xfitpar ] ) .    since the number of counts detected during the individual pspc pointings allows high signal - to - noise spectra , we investigated the possibility of x - ray spectral changes with time .\nfirst , we kept the absorbing column fixed at its galactic value and determined the temperature being the only fit parameter .\nwe find no systematic trend of a temperature decrease ( lower panel of fig .\n[ light ] ) .\nsecond , we kept the temperature fixed ( at 15 ev in the first run and at the best fit value of the two parameter fit in the second run ) and checked for changes in n@xmath0 , again finding no correlation .\nthus , no variations of the x - ray spectrum could be found along the orbit .\nthe rather small degree of observed variation of temperature and n@xmath0 ( tab .\n[ xfitpar ] ) over more than three years during quiescence ( including the all - sky - survey data ) are not regarded to be significant due to the correlation of these quantities ( fig .\n[ xspec ] ) .\nthe independent estimate of the absorbing column towards ag dra from the x - ray spectral fitting indicates that the detected ag dra emission experiences the full galactic absorption . while fits with n@xmath0 as free parameter ( see tab .\n[ xfitpar ] ) systematically give values slightly higher than the galactic value ( which might led to speculations of intrinsic absorption ) , we assess the difference to be not significant due to the strong interrelation of the fit parameters ( see lower right panel of fig .\n[ xspec ] ) given the energy resolution of the pspc and the softness of the x - ray spectrum .\nwe will therefore use the galactic n@xmath0 value ( 3.15@xmath210@xmath38 @xmath31 according to dickey and lockman 1990 ) in the following discussion .\nccccccc ror & date & & + no .\n& & n@xmath0 & flux & kt &  flux   & kt + survey & 901129 & 5.0 & 7040 & 10.6 & 172.5 & 14.6 + 200686 & 920416 & 5.1 & 4680 & 11.0 & 144.2 & 15.0 + 200687 & 920516 & 4.6 & 1280 & 11.7 & 147.0 & 15.0 + 200688 & 920613 & 4.9 & 2750 & 11.2 & 145.0 & 15.0 + 201041 & 920616 & 4.7 & 1520 & 11.6 & 146.7 & 15.0 + 201042 & 920920 & 3.5 & 860 & 13.2 & 304.1 & 14.0 + 201043 & 921216 & 4.2 & 1360 & 11.3 & 421.1 & 13.6 + 200689 & 930313 & 5.2 & 9060 & 10.6 & 160.1 & 14.9 + 201044 & 930316 & 4.5 & 1240 & 11.6 & 205.8 & 14.5 + 200690 & 930415 & 5.3 & 9760 & 10.6 & 147.7 & 14.9 + 200691 & 930512 & 5.1 & 9750 & 10.4 & 227.9 & 14.1 +    [ xfitpar ]    with n@xmath0 fixed at its galactic value the mean temperature during quiescence is about 1415 ev , corresponding to 160000175000 k. these best fit temperatures are plotted in a separate panel below the x - ray intensity ( fig .\n[ light ] ) .\nthe small variations in temperature during the quiescent phase are consistent with a constant temperature of the hot component of ag dra .      as noted already earlier ( e.g. friedjung 1988 ) ,\nthe observed fading of the x - ray emission during the optical outbursts of ag dra can be caused either by a temperature decrease of the hot component or an increased absorbing layer between the x - ray source and the observer . in order to evaluate the effect of these possibilities , we have performed model calculations using the response of the hri . in a first step ,\nwe assume a 15 ev blackbody model and determine the increase of the absorbing column density necessary to reduce the hri countrate by a factor of hundred .\nthe result is a factor of three increase . in a second step\nwe start from the two parameter best fit and determine the temperature decrease which is necessary to reduce the hri countrate at a constant absorbing column ( 3.15@xmath210@xmath38 @xmath31 ) .\nwe find that the temperature of the hot component has to decrease from 15 to 10 ev , or correspondingly from 175000 k to 115000 k.    the only rosat pspc observation ( i.e. with spectral resolution ) during optical outburst is the one with boron filter .\nthe three parameter fit as well as the two parameter fit give a consistently lower temperature .\nbut since the boron filter cuts away the high - end of the wien tail of the blackbody , and we have only 19 photons to apply our model to , we do not regard this single measurement as evidence for a temperature decrease during the optical outburst .    what seems to be excluded , however , is any enhanced absorbing column during the boron filter observation .\nthe best fit absorbing column of the three parameter fit is 4.4@xmath210@xmath38 @xmath31 , consistent with the best fit absorbing column during quiescence .\nsince the low energy part of the spectrum in the pspc is not affected by the boron filter except a general reduction in efficiency by roughly a factor of 5 , any increase of the absorbing column would still be easily detectable .\nfor instance , an increase of the absorbing column by a factor of two ( to 6.3@xmath210@xmath38 @xmath31 ) would absorb all photons below 0.2 kev and would drop the countrate by a factor of 50 contrary to what is observed .\nit is interesting to note that the decrease of the x - ray flux is similarly strong in both , the 1994 and 1995 outbursts , while the optical amplitude of the secondary outburst in 1995 was considerably smaller than the first outburst .\nwe note in passing that the intensity of the he and n lines also showed a comparable large increase in the main 1981/1982 outburst and the minor outburst in 1985/1986 while the optical and the short wavelength uv continuum amplitudes again were smaller in the latter outburst ( mikolajewska 1995 ) . since the short wavelength uv continuum is the rayleigh - jeans tail of the hot ( blackbody ) component , this behaviour suggests that a temperature decrease is the cause of the reduced x - ray intensity during outburst rather than increased absorption with the temperature decrease being smaller in the secondary outbursts .\nprevious analyses of x - ray emission of symbiotic stars have been interpreted either with blackbody ( kenyon and webbink 1984 ) or nlte atmosphere ( jordan 1994 ) models representing the hot component , or with bremsstrahlung emission from a hot , gaseous nebula ( kwok and leahy 1984 ) .\nour rosat pspc spectra of ag dra show no hint for any hard x - ray emission .\nthe soft spectrum is well fitted with a blackbody model .\na thermal bremsstrahlung fit is not acceptable to this soft energy distribution .\nthere is also no need for a second component as proposed by anderson ( 1981 ) : a fit of a blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung model with the bremsstrahlung temperature limited to values above 0.1 kev results in an unabsorbed flux ratio between blackbody and bremsstrahlung of 85000:1 in the 0.12.4 kev band . a hard x - ray component could be expected from an accretion disk both for radial and disk accretion ( livio 1988 ) at the relatively low accretion rate implied for this system .\nthis absence of any hard emission also rules out the possibility of interpreting the soft spectrum as arising in the boundary layer .\nthe most extreme ratios for soft to hard emission observed sofar in magnetic cataclysmic variables are of the order of 1000:1 .\nan example of the blackbody fit is given in fig .\n[ xspec ] using the observation of april 1993 ( having the largest number of photons ) .\nthe simple model of explaining the soft x - ray emission by an accretion disk is ruled out not only due to the soft spectrum , but also due to the observed luminosity which is much higher ( see below ) than can be produced by an accretion disk around a compact dwarf and the extremely low accretion rate .\nif the x - ray spectrum were to explained by a standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) then the necessary accretion rate would be of the order of 1.7@xmath210@xmath41 @xmath42@xmath43 ( or 4.5@xmath210@xmath44 /yr ) for a 1 compact object .\nthis is unreasonably small , basically due to the low effective temperature ( t@xmath45 = 24 ev ) of the x - ray emission coupled with a small mass compact object .    using the blackbody fit parameters\nwhile n@xmath0 was fixed at its galactic value , i.e. kt = 14.5 ev and a normalization parameter of 206 photons / cm@xmath4/s corresponding to observation 201044 ( from experience with soft rosat spectra we know that this procedure helps to avoid overpredicting the flux using blackbody models ) , the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity of the hot component in ag dra during quiescence ( 19901993 ) is ( 9.5@xmath11.5)@xmath210@xmath3 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 erg / s ( or equivalently 2500@xmath1400 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 ) with an uncertainty of a factor of a few due to the errors in the absorbing column and the temperature ( see fig .\n[ qnufnu ] for a visualization of the fact that the rosat measurement actually covers only the tail of the spectral energy distribution ) .\nthe blackbody radius is derived to be r@xmath40 = ( 4.1@xmath11.5)@xmath210@xmath47 cm ( d/2.5 kpc ) .\n( previous estimates arrived at much lower values due to the overestimate of the temperature . )\nthis high luminosity during quiescence and the size of the emitting region comparable to a white dwarf radius suggests that the primary is a white dwarf in the state of surface hydrogen burning . assuming that the bolometric luminosity of the hot component equals the nuclear burning luminosity , the burning rate is @xmath7 ( 3.2@xmath10.5)@xmath210@xmath5 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 /yr . under the assumption of a steady state the same amount of matter\nshould be accreted onto the white dwarf from the companion ( via wind or an accretion disk , see below ) .\nindeed , this burning rate lies within the stable - burning regime for a white dwarf of less than 0.6 ( iben and tutukov 1989 ) consistent with the core mass - luminosity relation l/@xmath7 4.6@xmath210@xmath48 ( m@xmath49/ 0.26 ) ( yungelson 1996 ) . from the orbital parameters ( mikolajewska 1995 , smith 1996 ) and an inclination less than about 85 ( see paragraph 5.1.2 ) the donor mass is estimated to be lower than 2 , in agreement with the estimated surface gravity of smith ( 1996 ) .      the observational coverage of ag dra over 1992/1993 is extensive enough to also investigate possible temporal and spectral changes of the x - ray flux along the orbital phase . using the ephemeris from skopal ( 1994 ) the minimum phases of ag dra occurred in november 1991 and june 1993 .\nthe coincidence of the u minimum and the drop in x - ray flux in mid-1993 is surprising , suggesting the possible discovery of orbital modulation of the x - ray flux .\nunfortunately , we have no full coverage of the orbital period , and thus the duration of the flux depression can not be determined .\nbut even with the available data this duration is a matter of concern : the x - ray intensity decrease occurs very slowly over a time interval of two months , suggesting a total duration of at least 4 months if this modulation is symmetric in shape .\nthe radial velocity data demonstrate that during the u minima the cool companion lies in front of the hot component ( cf .\nmikolajewska 1995 ) .\ndepending on the luminosity class , the maximum duration for an eclipse of the wd by the giant ( bright giant ) companion is 10 ( 24 ) days , i.e. much shorter than the observed time scale at x - rays .\nthus , the drop in x - ray intensity can not be due to a wd eclipse . as evidenced by near - simultaneous iue spectra between april and june 1993 , the far - uv continuum associated to the tail of the hot component s continuum emission\nis not occulted , supporting the previous argument .\na similar conclusion was reached when considering the nearly complete lack of orbital variations of the short wavelength uv continuum ( mikolajewska 1995 ) . by inverting the arguments ,\nthe lack of an x - ray eclipse implies that the inclination should be less than 87(82 ) for a giant ( bright giant ) with 20 ( 70 ) radius .    even in the reflection model of formiggini & leibowitz ( 1990 ) ,\nin which the eclipse of the hot component is short and its depth is expected to be considerably larger in the uv ( and possibly in the soft x - ray band ) than in the optical , it is difficult to imagine that a possible uv eclipse has been gone undetected .    alternatively to an eclipse interpretation of the x - ray intensity drop just before the 1993 u band minimum , one could think of a pre - outburst which was missed in the optical region except for the marginal flux increase in the b band after jd = 2449000 . in this case\nthe interpretation would be similar to that of the major x - ray intensity drops during the optical outbursts in 1994 and 1995 mass loss ( see below ) .\nindependent of the actual behaviour around jd = 9100 it is interesting to note that there is a secure detection of a 2 mag u brightness jump coincident with a nearly 1 mag b brightness increase shortly after jd = 9200 .\na slight brightening by about 0.20.3 mag is also present in the aavso light curve around jd 92059215 ( mattei 1995 ) .      accepting the high luminosity during quiescence and consequently assuming that the hot component in the ag dra system is in ( or near to ) the surface hydrogen burning regime , the companion has to supply the matter at the high rate of consumption by the hot component .\nit is generally assumed ( and supported by three - dimensional gas dynamical calculations of the accretion from an inhomogeneous medium ) that the compact objects in symbiotic systems accrete matter from the wind of the companion according to the classical bondi - hoyle formula .\nthe wind mass loss rate of the companion depends on several parameters .\none of the important ones is the luminosity which governs the location with respect to the linsky and haisch dividing line .\naccordingly , a bright giant ( luminosity class ii ) is expected to have a considerably larger mass loss rate than a giant ( luminosity class iii ) .    as mentioned already earlier ,\nthe spectral classification and the luminosity class of the companion in the ag dra binary system is not yet securely determined .\naccording to the formula of reimers ( 1975 ) : @xmath50 where r , l and m are the radius , luminosity and mass of the star in solar units , and @xmath51 a constant between 0.1 and 1 , depending primarily on the initial stellar mass , the commonly used k3iii classification would imply a mass loss rate of ( 0.27)@xmath210@xmath52 /yr , i.e. a factor of 100 lower than the rate necessary for steady state burning .    however , there are two additional observational hints which might help resolve the discrepancy between the expected mass loss of the cool donor and the necessary rate for a steady state burning white dwarf : ( 1 ) the cool component of ag dra might be brighter than an average solar - metallicity giant . a comparison of the luminosity functions of k giants with 4000 t@xmath12 4400 in a low - metallicity versus solar - metallicity population has shown convincingly that low - metallicity k giants are nearly 2 mag brighter than the solar - metallicity giants ( smith 1996 ) . ( 2 ) low - metallicity giants might have larger mass - loss rates than usual giants .\nfrom observed larger 12@xmath53 m excess in symbiotics as compared to that in normal giants a larger mass loss of giants in symbiotics has been deduced ( kenyon 1988 ) .\nthe recent comparison of ir excesses of d - type symbiotics with that of ch and barium stars supports this evidence ( smith 1996 ) .\nboth of these observational hints argue for a mass loss of the cool component in ag dra which is higher than the value derived from reimer s formula . at present\nit seems premature , however , to conclude that the wind mass loss of the donor in ag dra is large enough to supply the matter for a steady state surface burning on the white dwarf .\nan additional problem with spherical accretion at very high rates is the earlier recognized fact ( nussbaumer & vogel 1987 ) that the density of matter in the vicinity of the accretor is n@xmath54 2@xmath210@xmath55 ( /10@xmath41 /yr)(v/10 km / s)@xmath56(m@xmath57/)@xmath58 @xmath59 ( yungelson 1996 ) ,\ni.e. the soft x - rays of the burning accretor will be heavily absorbed .\nalternatively , one might consider the possibility that the donor overfills its roche lobe and that the matter supply to the white dwarf occurs via an accretion disk .\nseveral issues have to be considered : ( 1 ) roche - lobe filling : in order to fill its roche lobe , the donor has to be either rather massive ( as compared to a usual k giant ) or rather luminous .\nhowever , a donor mass larger than @xmath72 seems difficult due to the high galactic latitude and proper motion as well as on evolutionary grounds .\nsimilarly , a binary system with a bright giant implies a larger distance as compared to a giant companion .\n( 2 ) evidence for the existence of an accretion disk : indeed , garcia ( 1986 ) has raised the suspicion that ag dra contains an accretion disk .\ncircumstantial evidence for this comes from predictions of roche lobe overflow , rapid flickering on timescales of the order of minutes in the optical band and the observation of double - peaked balmer emission lines .\nrobinson ( 1994 ) have investigated in detail the double - peaked line profile of the balmer lines in several symbiotic stars . in the case of ag dra\nthey find double - peaked emission lines only in one out of three observations which were three and one year apart , respectively .\nusing an inclination of i=32 as proposed by garcia ( 1986 ) the double - peaked profile gives an acceptable fit for an accretion disk with an inner radius of 1.1@xmath210@xmath60 cm and an outer radius of 1.3@xmath210@xmath61 cm though the asymmetry may be explained also by self - absorption ( tomov & tomova 1996 ) .\nrecent high - resolution spectroscopy of ag dra in the red wavelength region using aurelie at ohp performed in december 1990 and january 1995 ( i.e. during very different phases in the ag dra orbit ) revealed only a single peaked h@xmath62 profile ( rossi 1996 ) and dobrzycka ( 1996 ) failed to find evidence for flickering . both of these new observational results argue against a steady accretion disk in the ag dra system .\nuv observations show that the hot components of symbiotic stars are located in the same quarters of the hertzsprung - russell diagram as the central stars of planetary nebula ( mrset 1991 ) . due to the large binary separation in symbiotic systems\nthe present hot component ( or evolved component ) should have evolved nearly undisturbed through the red giant phase .\nhowever , the outermost layers of the white dwarf might be enriched in hydrogen rich material accreted from the cool companion .\npresently the far - uv radiation of the wd is ionizing a circumstellar nebula , mostly formed ( or filled in ) by the cool star wind .\nthe uv spectroscopy suggests that the cno composition of the nebula is nitrogen enriched ( c / n=0.63 , and ( c+n)/o=0.43 ) , which is typical of the composition of a metal poor giant atmosphere after cn cycle burning and a first dredge up phase ( schmidt & nussbaumer 1993 ) .\nwe recall that recently a low metal abundance of the k - star photosphere of [ fe / h]=1.3 was derived ( smith 1996 ) in agreement with it being a halo object .\nthe uv spectrum in quiescence is the usual in symbiotic systems : a continuum increasing toward the shortest wavelengths with strong narrow emission lines superimposed .\nthe most prominent lines in the quiescence uv spectrum of ag dra are , in order of decreasing intensity : he 1640  , c 1550  , n 1240  , the blend of si and o ] at 1400  , n ] 1486 and o ] 1663  .\nthe continuum becomes flatter longward approximately 2600   due to the contribution of the recombination continuum originated in the nebula .\nalthough both continuum and emission lines have been found to be variable during quiescence ( e.g. mikolajewska 1995 ) , there is no clear relation with the orbital period of the system .\nthe ratio intensity of the recombination he 1640 line to the far - uv continuum at 1340  suggests a zanstra temperature of around 1.0 - 1.1@xmath210@xmath16 k during quiescence ( see fig . [ light ] ) .\nthe large x - ray luminosity together with its soft spectrum allows to understand the large flux from he , most notably @xmath134686  and @xmath131640  , at quiescence ( which could not be explained in earlier models ; see e.g. kenyon & webbink 1984 ) as being due to x - ray ionization .\nthree different basic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the drastic intensity changes of symbiotic stars during the outburst events : ( 1 ) thermonuclear runaways on the surface of the hot component ( wd ) after the accreted envelope has reached a critical mass ( tutukov & yungelson 1976 , paczynski & rudak 1980 ) .\nthe characteristic features are considerable changes in effective temperature at constant bolometric luminosity , and the appearance of an a  f supergiant spectrum thought to be produced by the expanding wd shell .\n( 2 ) instabilities in an accretion disk after an increase of mass transfer from the companion ( bath & pringle 1982 , duschl 1986 ) . ( 3 ) ionization changes of the h region ( from density - bounded to radiation - bounded ) around the hot component caused by an abrupt change in the mass loss rate of the companion ( nussbaumer & vogel 1987 , mikolajewska & kenyon 1992 ) . in the case of ag dra ,\nall these three scenarios have problems with some observational facts .\nthe thermonuclear runaway is rejected by the fact that the quiescent luminosity is already at a level which strongly suggests burning before the outbursts .\nthe disk instability scenario predicts substantial variation of the bolometric luminosity during the outbursts , for which no hints are available in ag dra .\nthe application of ionization changes to ag dra is questionable because the nebula is apparently not in ionization equilibrium ( leibowitz & formiggini 1992 ) .    specifically for ag dra\nan additional scenario has been proposed , namely ( 4 ) the liberation of mechanical energy in the atmosphere of the companion ( leibowitz and formiggini 1992 ) .\nusing our finding of an anticorrelation of the optical and x - ray intensity and the lack of considerable changes in the temperature of the hot component during the 1994/95 outburst of ag dra , we propose the following rough scenario .\n( 1 ) the white dwarf is already burning hydrogen stably on its surface before the optical outburst(s ) .\n( 2 ) increased mass transfer , possibly episodic , from the cool companion results in a slow expansion of the white dwarf . ( 3 )\nthe expansion is restricted either due to the finite excess mass accreted or by the wind driven mass loss from the expanding photosphere of the accretor .\nthis wind possibly also suppresses further accretion onto the white dwarf .\nthe photosphere is expected to get cooler with increasing radius .\n( 4 ) the white dwarf is contracting back to its original state once the accretion rate drops to its pre - outburst level .\nsince the white dwarf is very sensitive to its boundary conditions , it is not expected to return into a steady state immediately ( paczynski & rudak 1980 ) .\ninstead , it might oscillate around the equilibrium state giving rise to secondary or even a sequence of smaller outbursts following the first one .\nthe scenario of an expanding white dwarf photosphere due to the increase in mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope has been proposed already by sugimoto ( 1979 ) on theoretical grounds without application to a specific source class .\nthe expansion velocity was shown to be rather low ( fujimoto 1982 )    @xmath63 @xmath64    where @xmath65 at @xmath66 was adopted , appropriate for a low mass white dwarf accreting at high rates ( fujimoto 1982 ) .\nwe note in passing that this value could be different at smaller radii , i.e. near white dwarf dimensions ( see e.g. neo ( 1977 ) ) .\nin particular , depending on the location in the h - r diagram it would be around 2.3 on the high - luminosity plateau of a 0.6 @xmath67 white dwarf , but rising up to 7 around the high - temperature knee ( blcker 1996 ) , thus suggesting a non - linear expansion rate .\nif we assume that the luminosity remains constant during the expansion we can determine the expansion velocity simply by folding the corresponding temperature decrease by the response of the rosat detector .\nfitting the countrate decrease of a factor of 3.5 within 23 days ( from 0.14 cts / s on hjd 9929 to 0.04 cts / s on hjd 9952 corresponding to a concordant temperature decrease from 12.3 ev to 11.1 ev ) we find that @xmath68 for the input parameters ( blackbody radius ) corresponding to 2.5 kpc ( note that the input parameters change with distance ) .\nthe mass of the envelope @xmath69 is difficult to assess due to the non - stationarity in the ag dra system . in thermal equilibrium at our derived mean temperature it should be larger than 5@xmath210@xmath70 for a white dwarf with mass m @xmath71 0.6 in the steady hydrogen - burning regime ( fujimoto 1982 , iben & tutukov 1989 ) . inserting\nthis in the above equation implies that the accretion rate necessary to trigger an expansion which is consistent with the x - ray measurements has to be ( 8.1/2.5/1.4)@xmath210@xmath72 /yr for white dwarf masses of 0.4/0.5/0.6 . this is a factor of 40250 larger than the quiescent burning / accretion rate . the corresponding mean expansion rate is @xmath73 @xmath76.5 m / s . with a duration of the x - ray decline in 1995 of about 100 days ( which is consistent with the 1994 rise time in the optical region )\nwe find that during the 1995 outburst ( and probably also during the 1994 outburst ) the radius of the accretor roughly doubled while the temperature decreased by about 35% ( from 14.5 ev to 9.5 ev for the two parameter fit ) .\nthe countrate decrease modelled with the above parameters is shown as the dotted line in fig .\n[ light ] , and the extrapolation to the quiescent countrate level gives an expected onset of the expansion around hjd = 9902 .\na completely different and independent estimate of the response time of a white dwarf gives a similar result , thus it seems quite reasonable that a white dwarf can indeed expand and contract on a timescale ( see e.g. kovetz & prialnik 1994 , kato 1996 ) which is observed as optical outburst rise and fall time in ag dra .\nthe contraction timescale can be approximated by the duration of the mass - ejection phase ( livio 1992 ) , similar to the application to the supersoft transient rx j0513.96951 ( southwell 1996 ) , where @xmath74@xmath751/(@xmath75  @xmath76)@xmath77 days with being the ratio of white dwarf mass to the chandrasekhar mass ( livio 1992 ) .\nthis relation gives a timescale of the order of 100 days ( as observed ) for a white dwarf mass of 0.50.6 , consistent with observations of the ag dra optical outbursts .\ngiven the substantial accretion rate triggering the optical outbursts ( which has to be supplied by the donor ) , mass loss via a wind from the cool companion seems to be too low to power the outbursts .\ndepending on the donor state in quiescence ( where wind accretion is possible though we prefer roche lobe filling ; see paragraph 5.1.3 . ) , two possibilities are conceivable : either the companion fills its roche lobe all the time , and the outbursts ( i.e. the increased mass transfer ) are triggered by fluctuations of the cool companion ( e.g. radius ) , or a more massive and/or more luminous companion produces a strong enough wind to sustain the burning in the quiescent state without filling its roche lobe and only occasionally overfills its roche lobe thus triggering the outbursts . as noted above\n, a roche lobe filling giant implies a distance larger than the adopted 2.5 kpc . while this imposes no problems with the interpretation of our uv and x - ray data ( in fact a larger distance implies a larger intrinsic luminosity and thus shifts ag dra even further into the stability burning region for even higher white dwarf masses ) , the distance dependent numbers derived here have to be adapted accordingly .\nif the accretion indeed is spherical ( i.e. as wind from the donor ) , it may occasionally be suppressed by the wind from the accretor ( inaguchi 1986 ) .\nhot stars with radiative envelopes are thought to suffer intense ( radiation - driven ) stellar winds at a rate of @xmath78 = l/(v@xmath79 c ) where l is the burning luminosity , v@xmath79 is the escape velocity and c the speed of light .\nthis wind becomes increasingly effective at larger radii .\nthus , a radiatively driven wind from the wd ( prialnik , shara & shaviv 1978 , kato 1983a , b ) might restrict the expansion of a rg - like envelope or an expelled shell or even might remove the envelope ( yungelson 1995 )\n. an optically thick wind can be even more powerful by up to a factor of 10 ( kato and hachisu 1994 ) .\nthe wind of the hot white dwarf has typical velocities of a few hundreds km / s ( kato & hachisu 1994 ) . at these velocities\nit would take only several days until this white dwarf wind reaches the roche lobe of the cool component , i.e. the wind of the cool component .\nthis timescale is short enough to possibly cause the variations in the intensity of those lines which are thought to arise at the illuminated side of the wind zone of the cool component .\nan alternative to increased mass transfer would be to invoke a mild he flash on the hydrogen burning white dwarf which again might cause the photosphere to expand .\nprevious investigations for mild flashes have yielded timescales of the order of 1520 yrs even for the most massive white dwarfs ( paczynski 1975 ) .\nrecent calculations of h and he flashes have shown that under certain circumstances flash ignition can be rather mild without leading to drastic explosive phenomena , and shorter than about 1 yr already for white dwarf masses below 1 ( kato 1996 ) .\nthere is an evident mismatch between the outburst uv spectra and the extrapolation toward shorter wavelengths of the blackbodies with temperatures inferred from the rosat data ( fig .\n[ qnufnu ] ) .\nthe most plausible explanation is the existence of an additional emission mechanism in the uv , namely recombination continuum in the nebula surrounding the hot star . while during the quiescent phase the contribution of the nebular continuum is not very large ( although it is not negligible ) , it increases substantially during the outburst . as an example , the change in the strength of the balmer jump from july 1994 to december 1995 can be seen in fig . 4 of viotti ( 1996 ) .\nsupersoft x - ray sources ( sss ) are characterized by very soft x - ray radiation of high luminosity .\nthe spectra are well described by blackbody emission at a temperature of about kt@xmath7 2540 ev and a luminosity close to the eddington limit ( greiner 1991 , heise 1994 ) .\nafter the discovery of supersoft x - ray sources with observations , the satellite has discovered more than a dozen new sss .\nmost of these have been observed in nearby galaxies ( see greiner ( 1996 ) for a recent compilation ) . among the optically identified objects\nthere are several different types of objects : close binaries like the prototype cal 83 ( long 1981 ) , novae , planetary nebulae , and symbiotic systems .\nin addition to ag dra , two other x - ray luminous symbiotic systems with supersoft x - ray spectra are known ( rr tel , smc3 ) , both being symbiotic novae .\nrr tel was shown to exhibit a similar soft x - ray spectrum ( jordan 1994 ) and luminosity ( mrset & nussbaumer 1994 ) .\nrr tel is one of the only seven known symbiotic nova systems .\nit went into outburst in 1945 with a brightness increase of 7@xmath80 , and since then declined only slowly .\nsmc3 (= rx j0048.47332 ) in the small magellanic cloud was found to be supersoft in x - rays by kahabka ( 1994 ) , and has been observed to be in optical outburst in 1981 ( morgan 1992 ) .\nsimultaneous fitting of the and uv data was possible only after inclusion of a wind mass loss from the hot component , and gives a temperature above 260000 k ( jordan 1996 ) .\nsymbiotic novae are generally believed to be due to a thermonuclear outburst after the compact object has accreted enough material from the ( wind of the ) companion or an accretion disk .\nthe similarity in the quiescent x - ray properties of ag dra to those of the symbiotic novae rr tel and smc3 might support the speculation that ag dra is a symbiotic nova in the post - outburst stage for which the turn - on is not documented .\nwe have checked some early records such as the bonner durchmusterung , but always find ag dra at the 1011 intensity level .\nthus , if ag dra should be a symbiotic nova , its hypothetical turn on would have occurred before 1855 .\nwe note , however , that there are a number of observational differences between ag dra and rr tel which would be difficult to understand if ag dra were a symbiotic nova .\nif ag dra is not a symbiotic nova , it would be the first wide - binary supersoft source ( as opposed to the classical close - binary supersoft sources ) the existence of which has been predicted recently ( distefano 1996 ) .\nthese systems are believed to have donor companions more massive than the accreting white dwarf which makes the mass transfer unstable on a thermal timescale .\nthe major results and conclusions of the present paper can be summarised as follows :    * the x - ray spectrum in quiescence is very soft , with a blackbody temperature of about 14.5@xmath11 ev . *\nthe quiescent bolometric luminosity of the hot component in the ag dra binary system is ( 9.5@xmath11.5)@xmath210@xmath3 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 erg / s , thus suggesting stable surface hydrogen burning in quiescence . adopting a distance of ag dra of 2.5 kpc , the x - ray luminosity suggests a low - mass white dwarf ( m@xmath710.6 ) . * in order to sustain the high luminosity the cool companion in ag dra either has to have a wind mass loss substantially larger than usual k giants or is required to fill its roche lobe , and consequently has to be brighter than a usual k giant .\nthe mass of the cool component should be smaller than @xmath72 for the given orbital parameters and the mass ratio would be 25 . *\nthe monitoring of ag dra at x - rays and uv wavelengths did not yield any hints for the predicted eclipse during the times of the u light minima .\n* the recent optical outbursts of ag dra have given us the rare opportunity to study the rapid evolution of the x - ray and uv emission with time . during the optical outburst in 1994 the uv continuum increased by a factor of 10 , the uv line intensity by a factor of 2 ( see fig .\n[ iue1 ] ) , and the x - ray intensity dropped by at least a factor of 100 ( see fig . [ light ] ) .\nthere is no substantial time lag between the variations in the different energy bands compared to the optical variations .\n* there is no hint for an increase of the absorbing column during the one rosat pspc x - ray observation ( with spectral resolution ) performed during the decline phase of the 1994 optical outburst . instead\n, a temperature decrease is consistent with the x - ray data which is also supported by the spectral results .\n* modelling the x - ray intensity drop by a slowly expanding white dwarf with concordant cooling , we find that the accretion rate has to rise only slightly above @xmath81 .\naccordingly , the white dwarf expands to approximately its double size within the about three months rise of the optical outburst .\nthe cooling during this expansion is moderate : the temperature decreases by only about 35% . *\nthe uv continuum emission during quiescence consists of two components which both match perfectly to the neighbouring wavelength regions ( see fig .\n[ qnufnu ] ) .\nshortwards of @xmath72000 it corresponds to the tail of the 1415 ev hot component as derived from the x - ray observations .\nhowever , during the optical outbursts the uv continuum shortwards of @xmath72000 does not correspond to the tail of the cooling hot component ( 911 ev ) , but instead is completely dominated by another emission mechanism , possibly a recombination continuum in the wind zone around the hot component .\n* ag dra could either be a symbiotic nova for which the turn on would have occurred before 1855 , or the first example of the wide - binary supersoft source class .\nwe are grateful to j. trmper and w. wamsteker for granting the numerous target of opportunity observations with and .\nwe thank janet a. mattei for providing recent aavso observations of ag dra , m. friedjung for discussions on ag dra properties and d. schnberner and t. blcker for details on the expansion / contraction rate of small core -

ray ( ) and uv ( ) observations of the symbiotic star ag dra during a long period of quiescence followed recently by a remarkable phase of activity characterized by two optical outbursts . the major optical outburst in june 1994 and the secondary outburst in july 1995 were covered by a number of target of opportunity observations ( too ) with both satellites . optical photometry is used to establish the state of evolution along the outburst . our outburst observations are supplemented by a substantial number of x - ray observations of ag dra during its quiescent phase between 19901993 . near - simultaneous observations at the end of 1992 are used to derive the spectral energy distribution from the optical to the x - ray range . the x - ray flux remained constant over this three year quiescent phase . the hot component ( i.e. x - ray emitting compact object ) turns out to be very luminous : a blackbody fit to the x - ray data in quiescence with an absorbing column equal to the total galactic n@xmath0 in this direction gives ( 9.5@xmath11.5)@xmath210@xmath3 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 erg / s . this suggests that the compact object is burning hydrogen - rich matter on its surface even in the quiescent ( as defined optically ) state at a rate of ( 3.2@xmath10.5)@xmath210@xmath5 ( d/2.5 kpc)@xmath4 /yr . assuming a steady state , i.e. burning at precisely the accretion supply rate , this high rate suggests a roche lobe filling cool companion though bondi - hoyle accretion from the companion wind can not be excluded . with observations we have discovered a remarkable decrease of the x - ray flux during both optical maxima , followed by a gradual recovering to the pre - outburst flux . in the uv these events were characterized by a large increase of the emission line and continuum fluxes , comparable to the behaviour of ag dra during the 1980 - 81 active phase . the anticorrelation of x - ray / uv flux and optical brightness evolution is very likely due to a temperature decrease of the hot component . such a temperature decrease could be the result of an increased mass transfer to the burning compact object , causing it to slowly expand to about twice its original size during each optical outburst . 3.cm _ _ _ = = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=0pt = cmr7 _", "n_tokens": 17478, "_length_source": "text"}

state radiation , and may also be products of cascade decays of new heavy particles . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are backgrounds to most supersymmetry searches in final states with leptons , jets and missing transverse energy .\nthe @xmath10 signal is an irreducible background to inclusive hadronic searches of dark matter , based on jets and missing energy ( met ) .\nw or z + jets is also a major background for higgs searches .    in the context of the sm\n, the study of the production of electroweak bosons with @xmath11 allows for tests of perturbative qcd .\nthe production cross section scales approximately with the strong coupling constant for each additional jet .\nwhile current theoretical predictions at leading order ( lo ) and next to leading order ( nlo ) are in good agreement with data at the tevatron , comparison at the higher energy of the lhc , and at higher jet multiplicities are needed .\ninclusive and differential cross sections access the parameters of the perturbative expansion , such as the renormalization and the factorization scales , as well as the parton density functions ( pdfs ) , through the @xmath12 and @xmath13 distributions of the vector bosons and the associated jets .\npredicting all these quantities and comparing them to the tevatron data has already produced several improvements in the calculation and generation techniques , such as the introduction of generators based on the lo calculations of matrix - element ( me ) for the associated jet production , and the definition of several matching procedures to the parton - shower generators .    in this paper\nwe make a comparative study of me+ps monte carlo generators ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) with an nlo calculation ( @xmath1 ) , validated with tevatron d0 and cdf data , and generated at the lhc energy .\nthis will serve as a preparatory mc study of the major sm backgrounds for the regions that are relevant to new physics searches .\nthe parton shower ( ps ) technique is a collinear approximation of the description of parton splittings in qcd radiation that accompanies hard scattering processes .    however , although it provides a good description of low @xmath14 observables , it usually fails to fill the phase space ( ca nt emit anything above the factorisation scale by construction ) and in the hard region ( close to the factorisation scale ) this approximation is simply no good anymore .\none way to improve the description of kinematical observables is to add a matrix element ( me ) correction for the extra emissions .\nthis can be implemented in different ways , as will be described in each generator section .\nthe @xmath0 generator uses the improved ckkw matrix element - parton shower merging [ 1 ] that relies on a separation of the event phase space in two separated regions , defined by a choice of scale . above the chosen scale\n, all radiation must be produced by the matrix elements , and below the chosen scale all radiation produced by the parton shower . in matching these two regions to provide full phase space coverage , overlaps such as a parton shower emission in the scale range covered by the matrix element , must be removed [ 2 ] .\nthe basic steps in the algorithm implementation are [ 2 ] :    * events are generated based on the matrix elements for _ w / z _ + k jets , where k = 0 , ... n. the matrix element jets are required to be above the merging scale , @xmath15 . * the event is then reconstructed back from the final state particles .\nparticles are combined in the most likely combinations according to the parton shower probabilities .\n* events are then passed to the parton shower , which is allowed to generate radiation from any part of the process .\n* the shower is then analyzed , and any events in which parton shower produces an emission above the scale @xmath15 are vetoed , leading to a rejection of the full event .\nthis process is called sudakov rejection .\nthe @xmath0 generator automatizes the generation of inclusive samples , combining me for different parton multiplicities with ps and hadronization .\nsome parameters related to the me and ps calculations have to be set accordingly .\nthe aim of the me corrections in the ps on @xmath2 is to correct for two deficiencies in the shower algorithm : to populate the uncovered region of high @xmath14 in the phase space ( non - soft non - collinear ) , and to correct the populated region , where the extrapolation away from the soft and collinear limits is not perfect .\nthese corrections are called the hard and soft matrix element corrections respectively [ 3 ] .\nthe soft correction is derived by comparing the probability density that the @xmath16 resolvable parton is emitted into a region of the phase space in the ps approximation ( quasi - collinear limit ) , and the exact me calculation .\na simple veto algorithm is then be applied to the parton shower to reproduce the matrix element distribution , which relies on there always being more parton shower emissions than matrix element emissions .\nthis is ensured simply by enhancing the emission probability of the parton shower with a constant factor [ 3 ] .\nthe correction is applied to the hardest emission so far in the shower , to ensure that the leading order expansion of the shower distribution agrees with the leading order matrix element , and that the hardest ( i.e. furthest from the soft and collinear limits ) emission reproduces it [ 4 ] .      the hard me corrections aim to populate the high @xmath14 region that the ps leaves uncovered .\nthis domain of the phase space should have radiation distributed according to the exact tree level me for this extra emission , and as the parton shower does not populate this region , a different approach is needed to achieve this .\nprior to any showering , the algorithm checks if the required me is available for the hard process .\nthen , a point is generated in the appropriate region of phase space , with a probability based on a sampling of the integrand .\nthe differential cross section associated with this point is then calculated and multiplied by a phase space volume factor , giving the event weight .\nthe emission is accepted if the weight is less than a uniformly distributed random number in the [ 0,1 ] interval , and the momenta of the new parton configuration is processed by the shower as normal [ 3 ] .\nboth @xmath0 and @xmath2 described above include dominant qcd effects with leading order matrix elements combined with a leading logarithmic parton shower . however , higher order calculations are required to match the precision of current data measurements . going even one step beyond\nthe leading order is already a complex task : the initial hard process should be implemented in nlo ; and shower development would have to be improved in next to leading logarithmic accuracy in collinear and soft structure . an intermediate step has already been developed : keeping the leading logarithmic order for the shower approximation , while improving the treatment of the hard emission to nlo accuracy ( nlo+ps approach ) .\nwe test one such generator : @xmath1 .      in the @xmath1 ( positive weight hardest emission generator )\nformalism , the generation of the hardest emission is performed first , using full nlo accuracy , and using the @xmath2 parton shower to generate subsequent radiation .\nthe @xmath1 cross section for the generation of the hardest event has the following properties :    * at large @xmath17 ( momentum of incoming particle ) it coincides with the pqcd cross section up to ( o@xmath18 ) terms . *\nit reproduces correctly the value of infrared safe observables at the nlo .\nthus , also its integral around the small @xmath17 region has nlo accuracy .\n* at small @xmath17 it behaves as well as standard shower monte carlo generators .\nthe @xmath1 formula can be used as an input to any parton shower program to perform all subsequent ( softer ) showers and hadronization . however , as @xmath17 is used to define the matrix element scale , the parton shower must also be ordered in @xmath14 .\nthe shower is then initiated with an upper limit on the scale equal to the @xmath17 of the @xmath1 event , and fills in all radiation below that scale ( a truncated shower ) .\nfor the case of a virtuality or angular ordered shower , emissions at higher @xmath17 may be produced , and must subsequently be vetoed to avoid double counting with the me emission : a vetoed truncated shower , which is not possible with current parton shower programs like @xmath19 and @xmath20 .\nwe point out , however , that the need of vetoed truncated showers is not specific to the @xmath1 method .\nit also emerges naturally when interfacing standard matrix element calculations with parton shower . at present\n, there is no evidence that the effect of vetoed truncated showers may have any practical importance [ 5 ] .\nthe @xmath1 method solves the problem of negative event weights that arise in other nlo methods , such as in @xmath21 .\nit also defines how the highest @xmath14 emission may be modified to include the logarithmically enhanced effects of soft wide - angle radiation . in the @xmath1 framework ,\npositive weight events distributed with nlo accuracy can be showered to resume further logarithmically enhanced corrections by [ 3 ] :    * generating an event according to the @xmath1 formula ; * hadronizing non -

.\n, title=\"fig : \" ]\nwe studied the effects of adding a next to leading order term in the monte carlo simulation for _ z _ production in hadron colliders . in addition , the influence of adding a matrix element correction in the leading order calculations for improving the showering in the parton shower formalism , and the influence of some theoretical parameters that enter as input in the monte carlo programs .\nwe could see that the use of the nlo term , studied here in the @xmath1 formalism as implemented in the @xmath2 generator , improves the prediction of the cross sections of the processes , as well as the behaviour of the physics observables , specially in the region of higher transverse momentum .\nthe implementation of the matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism also improves the description of the data in the region of high transverse momentum , compared to the calculations in leading order without the correction .\nit was also seen that both @xmath0 and @xmath2 generators show a systematic behaviour lower than the tevatron data in the region of mid - range transverse momentum of the _ z _ boson .\nthe d0 analysis performed in the muon channel has a better monte carlo description than the one performed in the electron channel , and does nt use any kind of extrapolation based in theory . according to the new muon analysis ,\nif the same theory based corrections are applied , the muon data agree with the electron channel data .\nso , these theoretical dependent corrections could be responsible for the disagreement and the systematic behaviour between the monte carlo and the tevatron data in mid range transverse momentum of the _\nz_.    the underlying event analysis showed that it is possible to choose a good tune for the parameters in the multiple parton interactions model ( amisic ) for the @xmath0 generator , using the pdf that best describes the _ z _ @xmath14 data ( @xmath35 ) .\nhowever , for the @xmath2 generator , there was no parameter selection that could describe well the underlying event data , and the setup used was the standard one , based in the best description of other physics observables by the authors .    in the analysis of the balance of the _ z _ @xmath14 against the leading jet @xmath14 and the sum of @xmath14 of all jets in the event was possible to see the effects that the mpi model have in the region of low transverse momentum .\nthis is done in the appendix .\nthe analysis for lhc first run energy ( 7 tev ) shows that some kinematic quantities have a different prediction from @xmath2 _ z _ nlo when compared to @xmath0 _ _ z__+3 jets simulation , such as the low region of the _ z _ boson transverse momentum and leading jet @xmath14 and leading jets pseudorapidity in the high absolute value of @xmath13 range . for the cross section of jet production ,\nthe @xmath2 _ z _ nlo generator predicts a higher cross section for the first and second jets , while the @xmath0 _ _\nz__+3 jets show higher cross sections for higher jet multiplicities .\na full comparison once lhc has enough luminosity will show some features that the monte carlo generators will have to be able to deal with , implementing in their processes new information that the new data will provide .\nwe would like to thank frank siegert , prof .\nf. krauss , prof .\npeter richardson , for many useful discussions .\nthis work was supported by the marie curie research training network mcnet ( contract number mrtn - ct-2006 - 035606 ) .\n[ [ jet - recoil ] ] jet recoil + + + + + + + + + +    because primarily the _ z _ @xmath14 should be balanced in the event with the @xmath14 of the leading jet ( or all jets in the event ) , the study of the shape of the jet @xmath14 should give some information about the systematic difference in the description of the @xmath68 @xmath14 , and the leading jet @xmath14 in _ z _ events .\nwith the data , it is impossible to isolate the different effects of mpi and hard scatters , or extend below the @xmath14 cuts used in analysis .\nso , we perform some studies to check the @xmath14 balance in the mc samples , to see if the _ z _ @xmath14 was summing up to zero when added to the @xmath14 of the leading jet , the sum of the @xmath14 of all jets and , for a more fundamental check of balance , with the sum of the @xmath14 of all particles found in the event .    the first sanity check was done to assure that the sum of the transverse momentum of all particles in the event was balanced , so that both mc generators and @xmath25 were dealing with the events correctly .\nafter this check , the _ z _ @xmath14 balance against the sum of the @xmath14 of all jets in the event and leading jet was analyzed , for both @xmath0 and @xmath2 generators , with multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) turned on and off .\n[ fig:3slicesmpion ] shows that with the mpi model turned on , the @xmath0 and @xmath2 generators have different behaviour for low _ z _ @xmath14 region : @xmath0 shows more events concentrated in the region of ( _ z _ @xmath14 - jets @xmath14 ) = -17 for the leading jet and ( _ z _ @xmath14 - jets @xmath14 ) in the range of [ -5 , 0 ] for the sum of jets , while @xmath2 shows a behaviour that is very similar to that without the mpi model , in fig .\n[ fig:3slicesmpioff ] , upper plots .\n[ fig:3slicesmpioff ] shows that for the mpi model off in the generators , the behaviour is similar .\nhowever in fig .\n[ fig:3slicesmpion ] there is more @xmath14 in the jets , so this is nt balancing exactly all the transverse momentum that comes from the _ z _ boson . specially in the low region of the boson @xmath14 , we are probably seeing additional particles from mpi that do nt contribute to the _ z _

{"id": "dev_longform_572", "text": "supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking are central ideas both in contemporary particle physics and in mathematical physics . in this paper\n, we argue that for a large new class of d - brane models there exists a simple geometric criterion which determines whether supersymmetry breaking occurs .\nthe models of interest are based on calabi - yau singularities with d - branes placed at or near the singularity . by taking a large volume limit ,\nit is possible to decouple gravity from the theory , and ignore the calabi - yau geometry far from the branes .\nalthough one typically begins the construction with branes free to move throughout the calabi - yau space , many interesting theories include fractional branes ( or wrapped branes ) , which are d - branes stuck at the singularity and which can not move away from it .\nthese fractional branes can lead to topology changes in the geometry via gaugino condensation , which can be understood in terms of deformations of the complex structure of the calabi - yau singularity , and result in the replacement of branes by fluxes @xcite .\nmodels of this type , calabi - yau geometries with fluxes , are among the ingredients used to construct viable cosmological models within string theory with a positive cosmological constant @xcite , and which , because of that positivity , ultimately break supersymmetry . with current approaches in the literature , the issue of whether or not supersymmetry breaking is under control is controversial .\nit turns out that there exist some singular geometries which admit fractional branes , but for which the associated complex structure deformations are obstructed .\nwe will argue that in such setups a deformation can still take place , but that the geometric obstruction induces supersymmetry breaking .\ngiven a set of ordinary and fractional branes probing a calabi - yau singularity , supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometry ( susy - bog ) occurs when the singularity admits fewer deformations than the number of ( anomaly free ) independent fractional branes that one can add to the system .    in this paper\nwe will show how this breaking occurs in one particular example , d - branes probing the singularity of the calabi - yau cone over the first del pezzo surface , @xmath1 .\nthis case can be analyzed using the gauge theory / gravity correspondence . in field theory , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry ,\nthe deformation obstruction causes the breaking .\nthe susy - bog adds a new feature to the string theory landscape .\n@xmath1 belongs to a large class of singularities for which this geometric obstruction is easy to understand .\nwe need the technical concept from algebraic geometry of a singularity which is an `` incomplete intersection variety . ''\nthese varieties are described by @xmath4 equations in @xmath5 variables , where the dimension of the variety is strictly greater than @xmath6 . although the @xmath4 equations or relations are redundant , it is impossible to reduce the number of equations further without changing the geometry . in the case of an incomplete intersection ,\nthe redundancy makes it hard to deform the equations consistently , giving an obstruction to deformation .\nthese incomplete intersections are believed to be more generic than `` complete intersections , '' where the dimension of the variety is equal to @xmath6 .    in the dual field theory ,\nthe @xmath5 complex variables can be associated to generators of the chiral ring of the theory , while the relations in the geometry can be understood as relations in the chiral ring .\nwe will develop this picture further to make this set of ideas more precise .\na generic property of fractional branes is that they have gaugino condensation on their worldvolume , which translates to non - trivial deformed relations in the chiral ring of the field theory .\nwhen it is possible to deform the equations of the chiral ring consistently , the field theory realizes a supersymmetric vacuum .\nif it is impossible to deform the equations in the chiral ring consistently , then the theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .\nperhaps the prototypical example of a calabi - yau singularity with fractional branes is the conifold singularity , in the setups of klebanov and witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and its generalization to the warped deformed conifold geometry of klebanov and strassler ( ks ) @xcite .\nthe ks solution is an example of a space with no obstruction to deformation , and in this case chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in the strongly coupled dual gauge theory may be identified with the deformation in a precise way .\nrecall that the construction of the ks solution begins by placing a stack of @xmath7 d3-branes and @xmath8 d5-branes at the tip of the conifold : _\ni=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 = 0  .\n[ coneq ] the d5-branes are fractional . in the supergravity solution ,\nthe d - branes are replaced by their corresponding rr five - form and three - form fluxes .\nthe three - form flux from the d5-branes leads to a singularity unless the conifold is deformed : _\ni=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 =  .\n[ coneqdef ] this @xmath9 parameter is interpreted as a gaugino condensate in the dual theory and breaks the r - symmetry to @xmath10 .\nmoreover , cutting off the cone at a radius @xmath9 produces confining behavior of strings in this geometry which are dual to electric flux tubes in the gauge theory .\nnaively , one could imagine that a very similar phenomenon occurs for the cone over @xmath1 , but there is an obstruction . a theorem by altmann @xcite claims that there are no deformations of this cone .\nwhile the conifold has the single defining equation ( [ coneq ] ) , we recall below that the cone over @xmath1 requires twenty algebraic relations in @xmath11 which are not all independent .\nit is impossible to alter all twenty consistently by adding the analog of @xmath9 in ( [ coneqdef ] ) .\nthe conformal analog of the @xmath1 model with no d5-branes was first proposed separately by kehagias @xcite and by morrison and plesser @xcite as an example of a generalized ads / cft correspondence .\ntype iib string theory propagating in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a particular u(1 )\nbundle over @xmath1 , is equivalent to a superconformal @xmath14 gauge theory whose field content and superpotential were later derived in @xcite using techniques from toric geometry ( see fig .\n[ dp1 ] ) .\nrecently , the metric on @xmath13 was discovered .\nmartelli and sparks @xcite have shown that this u(1 ) bundle over @xmath1 , @xmath15 , is a particular example of the @xmath16 sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite . using the explicit metric ,\nimpressive comparisons of the conformal anomaly coefficients and r - charges between the ads and the cft sides were carried out for @xmath1 in @xcite .    as was the case for the conifold , adding d5-branes to the tip of the cone over @xmath1 breaks conformal invariance and leads to a cascading gauge theory @xcite . recently , a supergravity solution dual to this cascading theory was derived by herzog , ejaz , and klebanov ( hek ) @xcite .\nthe hek solution shares many of the features of the predecessor of the ks solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution @xcite . like the kt solution ,\nthe hek solution is singular in the infrared ( small radius ) ; at large radius , in the ultraviolet , the kt solution approaches the ks solution .\nthe large radius region can be used to calculate geometrically the nsvz beta functions and logarithmic running in the number of colors , and this geometric behavior matches our field theoretic understanding of a duality cascade .\nhowever , there currently is no known analog of the ks solution for @xmath1 that smooths the singularity in the infrared . the motivation behind this research was to understand the infrared physics of @xmath1 .      since the calabi - yau deformations are obstructed , we argue that supersymmetry is broken at the bottom of the duality cascade for @xmath1 .\nour argument has three field theoretic legs .\nfirst we argue that there is no superconformal fixed point to which the cascading theory may flow , ruling out strong coupling behavior that is not confinement .\nnext , turning on fayet - iliopoulos terms in the field theory , we show that the theory should confine in the infrared .\nlast , using the konishi anomaly @xcite , we show there are no solutions to the f - term equations .\nthe last step requires some immediate clarification .\nthe field theory analysis is well suited for studying vacua where mesonic operators get expectation values  the mesonic branch  and is less so for the baryonic branch .\nwe will show that the mesonic branch of the @xmath1 field theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .\nwe have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along the baryonic branch , but the argument is not as rigorous as the konishi anomaly approach . it may be that there exists a supersymmetric , pure flux supergravity solution ( which does not involve a calabi - yau manifold ) , similar to the recent @xmath17 structure solutions of @xcite . recall that the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch of the conifold field theory @xcite . as one moves along the baryonic branch , one finds that the geometry is no longer calabi - yau but is instead an @xmath17 structure solution where probe d3-branes break supersymmetry .    for generic initial number of d3- and d5-branes in the uv ,\nwe expect to have left - over d3-branes at the bottom of the cascade .\nthe ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch where these d3-branes will remain supersymmetric .\nhowever , even if there is an @xmath17 structure solution for @xmath1 , the left - over d3-branes will always break supersymmetry .\nwe emphasize that the supersymmetry breaking is an infrared effect .\nthe warp factor in the geometry will lead to an exponential separation between the ultraviolet and infrared scales , giving a natural way of achieving low - scale supersymmetry breaking should we embed this cone over @xmath1 in a compact calabi - yau .\nan optimistic point of view is that one might be able to build supergravity solutions from compactified versions of this cone over @xmath1 , and using these solutions , produce realistic cosmological models similar to @xcite where all stringy moduli are stabilized and supersymmetry is broken in a controlled way .\nsuch solutions deserve further study .\nthe quiver theory for the first del pezzo has four gauge groups and a number of bifundamental fields conveniently summarized using a quiver diagram ( see fig .\n[ dp1 ] ) .    , also known as an irregular @xmath18 fibration of @xmath19 blown up at a point.,width=288 ]    the superpotential for the first del pezzo takes the form w = _ u_l^v^y_1 - _ u_r^y_2 v^- _\nu_l^y_3 u_r^z  .\n[ wdp1 ] there is an @xmath20 global symmetry : the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are either one or two and @xmath23 .    in the case\n@xmath24 , the gauge theory has a superconformal fixed point with an ads / cft dual description : type iib string theory in a @xmath25 background .\nadding @xmath8 d5-branes breaks the superconformal symmetry and starts a seiberg duality cascade , as argued in @xcite . in the limit @xmath26\n, we can calculate the nsvz @xmath22-functions and find that generically the @xmath27 group runs to strong coupling first as the energy scale decreases .\ntaking the seiberg dual of the @xmath27 group yields the same quiver and superpotential but with @xmath28 , i.e. the number of d3-branes slowly decreases with energy scale .    before tackling the problem of what happens when @xmath7 becomes of order @xmath8 , we would like to demonstrate how the geometry of the first del pezzo can be recovered from the f - term relations of this gauge theory .\nthe superpotential ( [ wdp1 ] ) gives rise to the ten classical f - term equations = 0  , one for each @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .\nwe list these ten equations : @xmath35    to see the geometry emerge from the f - term equations , we study the spectrum of chiral primary operators of the schematic form = ( x_i_1 x_i_2 x_i_3  x_i_n )  , [ chpr ] where we contract all of the color indices to form a gauge invariant operator .\nthe trace structure means that these gauge invariant operators will correspond to loops in the quiver diagram .\nthe reason this expression ( [ chpr ] ) is schematic is that the actual chiral primary operator will be a polynomial of such traces .\nthe traces generate the chiral ring .\njust as we think of harmonic forms as representatives of classes in cohomology , we can think of a chiral primary operator as a representative of a class of operators related by the f - term equations . by only giving a single trace\n, we are really specifying a class of such operators related to each other by the f - term equations .\nthere are six types of operators that loop just once around the quiver @xmath36 u_r^z u_l^y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^v^  . from these six building blocks\n, we can form any operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) .\nthe final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver .\nnow of these six building blocks , only three are independent .\nnote that from ( [ v ] ) , @xmath37 and that @xmath38 .\nmoreover , under ( [ ur ] ) , @xmath39 .\nwe will choose the three independent blocks u_r^y_2 y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^v^  .\n[ threeblock ]    these blocks satisfy some additional important relations .\nthey are symmetric under interchange of their @xmath20 indices . from ( [ y3 ] ) , we see that @xmath40 .\nmoreover , from ( [ y3 ] ) and ( [ y1 ] ) , we see that u_r^z u_l^v^=u_r^z u_l^v^= u_r^z u_l^v^  .\nwe now study what happens when we assemble these blocks into larger operators .\nwe find that @xmath41 the @xmath42 has been added as a guide to the eye .\nsimilar types of manipulation reveal also that these blocks commute with one another .\nin particular u_r^y_2 y_3 u_r^z u_l^y_3 = u_r^z u_l^y_3 u_r^y_2 y_3  , and that u_r^z u_l^y_3 u_r^z u_l^v^= u_r^z u_l^v^u_r^z u_l^y_3  .\nfinally , with a little more work , one can show that any product of the ( [ threeblock ] ) is symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,\nwe conclude that the most general operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) takes the schematic form ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j y_2 y_3 ) ) [ ch1 ] or ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j z u_l^_j v^_j ) )  . [ ch2 ]\nthese operators are understood to be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .\nthe first operator transforms in a @xmath43 dimensional representation of @xmath20 while the second transforms in a @xmath44 dimensional representation . in the case\n@xmath24 , there is a superconformal symmetry and we can assign r - charges to these elements of the chiral ring .\nthe r - charge of ( [ ch1 ] ) is @xmath45 while the r - charge of ( [ ch2 ] ) is @xmath46 .\nwe will recalculate these charges in the appendix directly from the metric . ]    at this point , it is convenient to introduce some new notation for the building blocks ( [ threeblock ] ) :    ccc .\nc a_1 = u_r^1 y_2 y_3 + a_2 = u_r^2 y_2 y_3    . , & .\nc b_1 = u_r^1 z u_l^1 y_3 + b_2 = u_r^1 z u_l^2 y_3 + b_3 = u_r^2 z u_l^2 y_3    .\nc c_1 = u_r^1 z u_l^1 v^1 + c_2 = u_r^1 z u_l^1 v^2 + c_3 = u_r^1 z u_l^2 v^2 + c_4 = u_r^2 z u_l^2 v^2    . .    from these nine operators , which we can treat as commuting\n, we can construct any operator of the form ( [ ch1 ] ) or ( [ ch2 ] ) subject to some relations .\nin particular , we know that the resulting operator must be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices and moreover an @xmath47 and @xmath48 type operator annihilate to form two @xmath49 operators ( [ annihilation ] ) .\nthe set of twenty relations these operators satisfy is given in appendix a.    we can find a set of monomials with identical algebraic properties . in particular , we let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and    ccc    c a_1 = x^2 y + a_2 = x^2 z    ,    c b_1 = x y^2 + b_2 = x y z + b_3 = x z^2    ,    l c_1 = y^3 + c_2 = y^2 z + c_3 = y z^2 + c_4 = z^3    .\n[ c4 ] in this way , the operators commute by construction and the number of @xmath50 s labels whether the operator is of type @xmath47 , @xmath49 , or @xmath48 .\nthe number of @xmath51 s equals the number of @xmath20 indices set to one while the number of @xmath53 s equals the number of @xmath20 indices set to two . in any product of the @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath48 ,\nthe fact that the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 commute is equivalent to the fact that the operator is totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices . only slightly more difficult to see is ( [ annihilation ] ) .    because the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 commute , one can diagonalize all of these matrix valued operators simultaneously . eigenvalue by eigenvalue\n, these operators describe a three dimensional variety , parametrized above by @xmath57 .\nthis variety is the calabi - yau geometry we are interested in .\nthe description of a general point in the moduli space is a set of @xmath7 unordered points of the calabi - yau geometry .\nwe call this moduli space the mesonic branch of the theory . that we have found a calabi - yau in this way is in line with the expectations of reverse geometric engineering @xcite .    now , treating @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 as homogenous coordinates on @xmath58 , this set of monomials can be reinterpreted as a set of linearly independent polynomials on @xmath19 which vanish at the point @xmath59 for @xmath60 . this set of monomials then provides a map from @xmath61 with the point @xmath62 missing because the origin is not contained in @xmath63 .\nthe smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath19 blown up at a point\n.      we can be more precise in our description of this first del pezzo .\nit is easy to embed @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 .\nlet @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 be homogenous coordinates on the @xmath19 , as above , and let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be coordinates on the @xmath67 .\nthe first del pezzo is described as the hypersurface @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 .\nwe now construct a map from @xmath70 to @xmath71 by considering all monomials linear in the @xmath72 and quadratic in the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 .\n( algebraic geometers would call this map a composition of the segre and veronese maps . )\n@xmath73 this map restricts to an injective map from @xmath1 to @xmath63 by requiring @xmath69  of the twelve monomials above , only nine are linearly independent under this relation .\nnow for a point on @xmath1 where @xmath51 and @xmath53 do not both vanish , the constraint @xmath69 fixes a point on the @xmath67 which we can take to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in this case , the twelve monomials in @xmath76 reduce precisely to the nine monomials given as ( [ c4 ] ) .\nthus this @xmath77 certainly contains the image of the map described above from @xmath61 .    using the twelve monomials that depend on the @xmath72\n, we can also describe the extra blown up @xmath67 in @xmath1 .\nconsider the case @xmath78 and @xmath79 .\nnow , the @xmath72 are unconstrained , and the only two nonvanishing monomials in the @xmath71 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which parametrize the blown up @xmath67 .\nnaively , this description of the first del pezzo seems overly complicated .\nfor example , we may just as easily consider the simpler segre map to @xmath82 : @xmath83 subject to the relation @xmath84 we have a simpler embedding of the first del pezzo inside @xmath85 .\nhowever , we are not just describing the geometry of the del - pezzo surface , but a particular algebraic cone over it , which results from blowing down the zero section of the total space of a line bundle over @xmath1 which makes the space a calabi - yau geometry .\nwe will now give a plausible argument that the field theory on a stack of d3-branes and d5-branes probing a @xmath1 singularity does not have a superconformal fixed point in the infrared .\nthis absence helps rule out strong coupling behaviors in the ir field theory which are not gaugino condensation .\na necessary condition for the presence of a superconformal fixed point in a gauge theory is the vanishing of the nsvz beta functions and the requirement that the superpotential be marginal .\nwe will assume that there is an @xmath20 global symmetry .\nas a result , the anomalous dimensions of the doublet fields will be equal , @xmath86 and similarly for the @xmath87 and @xmath88 .\nmoreover , because of this @xmath20 , there will only be three independent superpotential couplings .\nwe find it convenient to work with r - charges rather than with the anomalous dimensions @xmath89 .\nrecall that at a superconformal fixed point , the supersymmetry algebra implies that @xmath90 .    for the nsvz beta functions to vanish\n, the following expressions must vanish : @xmath91 moreover , the superpotential couplings must be marginal , which implies that each of the @xmath92 have r - charge two : @xmath93 this set of seven equations is not linearly independent . in the case\n@xmath24 , there is a two parameter family of solutions . in the case\n@xmath94 , there is just a one parameter family .\nhowever , the existence of a family of solutions to these beta function constraints is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of a superconformal fixed point . from intriligator and wecht @xcite , we know that at a superconformal fixed point , the conformal anomaly @xmath95 should be at a local maximum . here , @xmath96 is a trace over the r - charges of all of the fermions in the gauge theory . for the @xmath24 case\n, it is indeed possible to maximize @xmath47 over the two parameter family of solutions , and one can match the results to geometric expectations @xcite .\nhowever , in the case @xmath94 , @xmath47 can not be maximized .\nif we let @xmath97 parametrize the family of solutions to the beta function constraints , it is straightforward to see that r^3 = 24 ( -19 m^2 - 27 mn - 9n^2 + ( m+n)(2m+n ) r_v ) is a linear function in @xmath98 .\nin fact , one can see the pathology in the @xmath99 case even before computing @xmath47 .\nthe r - charges of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 operators of the previous section do not depend on @xmath97 .\none finds that @xmath100 while @xmath101 .\nin other words , a finite fraction of operators in the chiral ring  those with enough of the @xmath54 as building blocks  will have a conformal dimension below the unitarity bound .\nsuch a pheonomenon has been encountered before studying simpler sqcd like gauge theories @xcite where it was argued that accidental u(1 ) symmetries emerge in the infrared which decouple these troublesome operators from the theory once their dimension reaches the unitarity bound . however , in these simpler cases , there was a finite number of such operators and there was also a well defined ultraviolet where the theory became asymptotically free .\nwe have an infinite number of troublesome operators , and truncating them from the theory will radically change the geometry .\na simpler and we believe more probable resolution to this pair of problems  an inability to maximize @xmath47 and an infinite set of operators below the unitarity bound  is that the corresponding superconformal fixed point does not exist .    at the beginning\n, we assumed an su(2 ) symmetry . if we allow this su(2 ) to be broken , we can maximize @xmath47 but there will still be an infinite number of operators with negative conformal dimension .\nwe begin by analyzing the theory with no d3-branes and @xmath7 d5-branes .\nsuch a gauge theory can be thought of as the last step in the seiberg duality cascade , starting in the uv with a multiple @xmath102 of d3-branes .\nstarting with the pure d5-brane theory precludes the possibility of a baryonic branch , a possibility we will return to later .    the pure d5-brane gauge theory has gauge group @xmath103 and classical superpotential w = u_r^2 y_2 v^1 - u_r^1 y_2 v^2  . we will keep the @xmath20 global symmetry , and thus single loops involving the @xmath104 field\ncan not appear in the superpotential .\nmost aspects of our analysis are standard in the study of @xmath14 supersymmetric gauge theories .\nsee @xcite for a selection of relevant reviews .\nfirst , we argue that confinement and gluino condensation occur at low energies in our gauge theory . because these gauge groups are @xmath105 ,\nthey will have three decoupled @xmath18 subgroups , some of which allow the addition of fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms .\ngroup is forbidden .\nwhen we write out the full matrix structure of the d - term equations , the d - term equation for the @xmath106 gauge group is of the form @xmath107 with the @xmath108 field contracted on its @xmath109 indices and the @xmath88 fields contracted on their @xmath105 indices . for positive ( negative ) @xmath110\nwe may consider giving @xmath108 ( @xmath88 ) an expectation value independent of the other field .\nbut by applying gauge rotations to this field it is always possible to eliminate components of the field such that the contracted form is diagonal and nonvanishing only on @xmath111 of its @xmath112 diagonal components , inconsistent with the d - term equations .\n] suppose we add an fi term @xmath113 for the @xmath114 .\nfor the purposes of this argument we take @xmath113 to be large compared to other scales in the problem and temporarily ignore the superpotential .\nthe relevant piece of the classical khler potential for the gauge theory is ( + v^1 ( v^1)^+ v^2 ( v^2)^+ y_3 y_3 ^ -

terms\n, we expect their presence or absence to be independent of @xmath113 .\ntherefore we expect confinement and chiral symmetry breaking for our triangle quiver gauge theory .\nthis analysis applies to the general point in the mesonic branch , with or without extra probe d3-branes in the bulk .\nif we had additional branes in the bulk , confinement of the fractional brane stuck at the singularity should still happen .\nthere is a lot of evidence that branes in the bulk do not modify the essential dynamics of the fractional branes @xcite , although the fractional branes do modify the dynamics of the branes in the bulk by deforming their moduli space .\nin essence , the analysis of the fractional branes can be done without ever mentioning the branes in the bulk , but the result will be correct even if branes in the bulk are present . if gaugino condensation happens , we should expect to see a deformed moduli space for the branes in the bulk : the quantum moduli space of the gauge theory .\nan important point is that our @xmath118 theory has no flat mesonic directions .\nthe f - term equations for the classical superpotential imply that @xmath119 .\nthus , we can not form any nonzero gauge invariant trace operators .\nthere are some anti - symmetrized products of fields , the dibaryon operators , for example = _ _ 1 _ 2n ^_1 _\nn ^_1 _ n ( y_3)^_1__1 ( y_3)^_n__n ( v^1)^_n+1__1 ( v^1)^_2n__n  . by turning on fi terms for the @xmath109 and @xmath105 gauge groups\n, we can fix the expectation value of @xmath120 .\nignoring the @xmath18 subgroups for the moment , note that the @xmath121 group is the only one of the three gauge groups to have @xmath122 , so it is natural to suppose that it runs to strong coupling first . in this case\nwe may construct the effective superpotential at low energies by standard arguments . ignoring strong coupling effects from the other gauge groups ,\nthe quantum modified superpotential is @xcite w = m^2 v^1 - m^1 v^2 + n ( ) ^1/n [ quantumw ] where we have defined the mesonic operators @xmath123 and a square matrix @xmath124 . at strong coupling\nwe treat the mesons @xmath8 as if they were fundamental fields .\nthe equation of motion for the @xmath32 sets @xmath125 .\nhowever , the equation of motion for the @xmath126 tells us that 0 = _ ij v^j_ab -  .\nthis equation is not consistent with setting the @xmath127 and we conclude that supersymmetry is broken .    because the @xmath121 theory has the largest number of colors and smaller number of flavors , we generically expect @xmath121 to run to strong coupling first .\nit is possible that the other two groups run to strong coupling as well , which might invalidate the analysis done above . in the next subsection\nan exact argument using the generalized konishi anomaly demonstrates that the @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath121 groups can not be strongly coupled at the same time .\nwe have argued that supersymmetry is broken when @xmath130 is the dominant scale in the problem . as the couplings become large , anomalous dimensions can also become large and in the absence of a superconformal fixed point it is very difficult to control the rg flow . at generic points in the space of coupling constants , the approximations made in section [ simplesusyb ] may be invalid and it is not clear whether supersymmetry will be broken .    to make a stronger argument we need a better method to determine the possible quantum modifications to @xmath131 . a technique that we will find very powerful\nis based on the konishi anomaly @xcite ; see also the review of amati et al @xcite and the more recent developments of @xcite .\nsome of this analysis can be rephrased in terms of the language of the dijkgraaf - vafa matrix model approach @xcite , which is a useful way of encoding the same set of quantum modified equations of motion .\nthese matrix models and konishi anomaly calculations can encode the ( quantum ) deformations of complex structure of the calabi - yau space @xcite .\nthe generalized konishi anomaly equations are derived by considering infinitesimal variations of the fields , which leave the path integral invariant , and obtaining the associated ward identities , restricted to the chiral ring . for a variation of the bifundamental @xmath132 where we take\n@xmath133 and @xmath134 is the supersymmetric gauge field strength , one finds -

term arguments given earlier , which implied that some of the @xmath144 have to be non - zero .\nour anomaly arguments assumed supersymmetry , so we conclude that supersymmetry must be broken ( or that the vacuum of the theory is in some other way ill - defined . )    the inability to satisfy these constraints is reminiscent of the geometric obstruction to deformation discovered by altmann @xcite ( see appendix a for a brief review ) .\nthe cone over @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of twenty ( dependent ) equations in nine variables .\nit is possible to deform these equations by a parameter @xmath9 , but one finds that mutual consistency of the deformed equations requires that @xmath146 vanishes . if @xmath9 were not obstructed , we would identify this deformation of the geometry with the quantum deformed moduli space of the mesonic branch : gaugino condensation leads to a quantum modified chiral ring , and we have already described in the previous section how the chiral ring and the calabi - yau geometry are related .\nour analysis suggests a strong relation between the geometry of the calabi - yau space and spontaneous susy breaking .\nwe correlate the geometric deformation obstruction to inconsistencies of the quantum modified chiral ring .\nthus the name susy - bog : supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometries .    for completeness\nlet us consider another set of anomaly equations , which we obtain from the variations @xmath147 .\nthe anomaly equations for the @xmath31 and the @xmath148 give @xmath149 while for the @xmath108 , we find @xmath150 a similar equation for @xmath104 yields s_1 s_2 = 0  .\n[ quadraticrel ] because @xmath104 does not appear in the superpotential .    taking these quadratic relations for the @xmath144 on their own\n, we would conclude that two of the @xmath144 are zero .\nfurthermore , if only one of the gauge groups has a nonzero @xmath144 , we can assume for that particular gauge group @xmath122 .\nthe only reasonable possibility is @xmath151  but we have already shown that if the @xmath121 group flows to strong coupling first , then supersymmetry should be broken .\nall our analysis so far has concerned the pure d5-brane theory , but as argued before , this analysis extends to the case where there are branes in the bulk : what happens at the singularity is independent of the branes in the bulk and supersymmetry is broken on the mesonic branch of the general theory .    however , there are other baryonic branches in moduli space which we have not analyzed yet . for our quiver theory ,\nwe can halt our seiberg duality cascade one step up from the bottom , at the @xmath152 theory .\nif the group with the largest number of colors @xmath153 runs to strong coupling first , we have effectively @xmath154 sqcd with a tree level superpotential . as was noticed in @xcite , such a theory will have a quantum modified superpotential .\nin addition to the mesonic branch , there is a branch of moduli space where baryonic operators get expectation values .\nwe will argue that supersymmetry is broken even if we give these baryonic operators expectation values .\nto to try to gain a deeper understanding of the various possibilities , it is useful to review what happens in the case of the conifold .\none step up from the bottom of the duality cascade on the conifold , we have an @xmath155 theory with bifundamentals @xmath156 and @xmath157 , @xmath158 and a quartic superpotential w_tree = _ ij _ kl a_i b_k\na_j b_l at strong coupling for the @xmath129 group , we form the mesonic operators @xmath159 , and the superpotential is modified by quantum effects @xcite w_eff = w_tree + x ( m + b -

[ weffnfnc ] on the baryonic branch , @xmath160 while the mesonic expectation values and the lagrange multiplier @xmath161 vanish .\none may obtain a low - energy effective theory on this branch by integrating out the mesons , leaving us with a pure @xmath128 gauge theory supplemented by the baryonic operators @xmath162 , which lie on a flat direction .\nthe klebanov - strassler supergravity solution corresponds to the symmetric point @xmath163 on the baryonic branch @xcite .\na one real parameter family of supersymmetric supergravity solutions corresponding to changing @xmath164 was worked out by @xcite .\nthe remarkable fact about this one parameter family of solutions is that it does not involve a calabi - yau manifold .\ninstead , it requires only a manifold with @xmath17 structure .    the altmann theorem mentioned in the introduction states only that the calabi - yau cone over @xmath1 has no complex structure deformations .\nif we relax the calabi - yau condition to an @xmath17 structure condition , there may still be supersymmetric supergravity solutions , as there are for more general points on the baryonic branch of the conifold theory .\nwe now exclude the possibility of an @xmath17 structure solution .\nreturning to the four - node quiver theory with gauge group @xmath165 , with the @xmath153 group at strong coupling , we argue that although this theory has a baryonic branch the konishi anomaly arguments still imply that supersymmetry is broken . the first step is to replace the elementary fields charged under the @xmath153 gauge group by mesons and baryons which are @xmath153 singlets . specifically , we construct mesons @xmath166 and @xmath167 , which have their @xmath153 indices contracted , and baryons @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 $ ] , whose @xmath153 indices are fully antisymmetrized .\nthis theory develops a quantum - modified superpotential of the form ( [ weffnfnc ] ) and has a baryonic branch , along which the baryons acquire expectation values . on this branch\none also finds that the lagrange multiplier @xmath161 and @xmath170 vanish .    what happens to the remaining mesons ?\nthe mesons @xmath171 appear only in a cubic term in the tree - level superpotential , so they remain as light fields in the theory . on the other hand ,\nthe mesons @xmath172 have a mass term from the tree - level superpotential of the form @xmath173 and we may integrate these fields out .\nthe f - terms for the mesons @xmath172 force @xmath174 , while the f - terms from varying @xmath32 require @xmath175 . by applying gauge rotations to the @xmath176 and @xmath87 fields\none can see that the determinant of the meson matrix vanishes , and that the f - term equations are therefore satisfied consistently on this branch .    after integrating out these massive fields , and relabeling the light fields\n, one finds that the resulting low - energy effective theory is precisely that of the three - node quiver , supplemented by the baryonic operators .\nhowever , the baryons do not communicate with the @xmath118 degrees of freedom .\nthis baryonic flat direction can not interfere with the arguments for supersymmetry breaking given in section [ quantummoduli ] .\nthe preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not as strong as the konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch .\nfor example , we were not able to analyze the possibility that both the @xmath121 and @xmath153 groups ran to strong coupling at once .\nhedging our bets , we will assume for the moment the existence of a supersymmetry preserving baryonic branch for the @xmath1 theory and a corresponding @xmath17 structure supergravity solution .\nwe may ask what happens to probe d3-branes in this putative supersymmetric vacuum .\nafter all , for generic initial numbers of d3- and d5-branes in the uv , the duality cascade will generically leave some left over d3-branes in the bulk .\nin the klebanov - strassler solution , these extra d3-branes were supersymmetric , but what happens at an arbitrary point on the baryonic branch ?\naway from the ks point , these probe d3-branes in the conifold should break supersymmetry .\nthe authors of @xcite claim that this baryonic branch supergravity solution for the conifold interpolates between the ks and the maldacena - nunez ( mn ) @xcite supergravity solutions . moreover , for mn , d3-brane probes break supersymmetry .\nlet us describe more explicitly these supersymmetry conditions for d3-brane probes .\nlet @xmath9 be a killing spinor in the ten dimensional geometry .\nthe presence of @xmath14 supersymmetry in four dimensions guarantees the existence of at least a four dimensional representation of such spinors . for a probe d3-brane to be supersymmetric , @xmath9 must be an eigenspinor of the corresponding @xmath113-symmetry matrix for the probe : @xmath177 . for a d3-brane aligned in the gauge theory directions , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , and @xmath178 ,\nthe @xmath113-symmetry matrix is just the four dimensional gamma matrix _ = i _ t _ x _ y _ z  . in other words , @xmath9 must have positive chirality in the four gauge theory directions .\nthe killing spinors in the @xcite @xmath17 structure solutions take the general form = _ + _ + + _ - _ -  , where @xmath179 are the chiral and anti - chiral four dimensional spinors , and @xmath180 are chiral and anti - chiral six dimensional spinors .\nthe @xmath21 and @xmath22 are complex functions of coordinates on the six - dimensional transverse geometry . in the ks solution , @xmath181 , and so @xmath182 , while for the mn solution , @xmath183 , and the d3-brane breaks supersymmetry . indeed , for any nonzero value of @xmath22 , the d3-brane will break supersymmetry .    using the table of possible @xmath17 structure solutions in @xcite\n, we can make a stronger , more general statement .\nif the d3-brane preserves supersymmetry , then @xmath184 .\nif @xmath184 , the six dimensional transverse geometry must be calabi - yau\n. however , altmann claims there is no calabi - yau deformation of the cone over @xmath1 . therefore ,\nif there is an @xmath17 structure solution corresponding to the baryonic branch of this @xmath1 field theory , probe d3-branes will break supersymmetry .\nwe have shown , using a combination of traditional field theory and supergravity arguments , that generically supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies in the duality cascade constructed from the cone over @xmath1 .\ntraditional field theory convinced us that the mesonic branch must break supersymmetry .\nalthough there is a small possibility that the baryonic branch remains supersymmetric , for generic initial numbers of d3- and d5-branes , there will be extra d3-branes at the bottom of the cascade which we argued should also lead to supersymmetry breaking .\nthis mechanism for supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometries , or susy - bog , should work more generally .\nwe start with some calabi - yau cone to which we add d3- and d5-branes .\ngenerically , a duality cascade will result , where the number of d3-branes is gradually reduced as we move toward the tip of the cone . when we reach the bottom of the cascade , we expect to find a confining theory and presumably confinement will happen via gaugino condensation . in such a situation\n, we expect a deformed chiral ring and hence a deformed complex structure of the geometry .\nthe unifying feature of the susy - bog mechanism is an obstruction in the complex deformation space of the calabi - yau cone .\nour conjecture is that in all of these situations supersymmetry will be spontaneously broken .\nthe cone over @xmath1 is not alone in having such an obstruction .\nfor example , we expect to be able to set up a duality cascade using the @xmath16 space @xcite , but there is such an obstruction for all the @xmath16 , @xmath185 .    for the higher del pezzos @xmath186 , @xmath187 , there will also generically be a problem .\nwe expect to be able to set up a duality cascade . for the general @xmath186\nthere are @xmath4 vanishing two - cycles and thus @xmath4 types of d5-branes .\nhowever , in general there are fewer than @xmath4 complex structure deformations @xcite .\nfor example , for @xmath188 , there is only one such deformation .\nthus , unless the initial numbers of d5-branes are chosen carefully , we expect susy - bog to occur at low energies , at the end of the duality cascade .\nwhile we were finishing this paper , @xcite appeared .\nthe authors claim to find a first order complex structure deformation of the cone over @xmath1 and construct from this first order deformation the analog of the ks solution @xcite for @xmath1 .\nthis construction is completely compatible with our story .\nwe anticipate , from @xcite , that they will not be able to continue their deformation to higher order in @xmath9\n. it would be very interesting , but presumably quite difficult , to construct a non - supersymmetric gravity solution for the deformed cone .\n* note added * after this work was completed , we became aware of the closely related papers @xcite which reach similar conclusions .\nwe would like to thank marcus berg , aaron bergman , henriette elvang , michael haack , igor klebanov , matt strassler , and brian wecht for useful discussions and comments .\nthanks the university of washington particle theory group for hospitality while this work was being completed .\nthe work of d.  b. and s.  p is supported in part by doe grant de -

oxidized the chain and as a result exposed the difference in the capacities of complex ii between normoxic and hyperoxic lungs . \n regardless , this apparent decrease in complex ii activity is

due to a direct oxidant - induced inhibition of complex ii or indirect inhibition of complex ii by impairment of krebs cycle enzymes / coenzymes that result in a decrease in succinate concentration or increase in the concentration of oxaloacetate ( oaa ) . complex ii activity is inhibited by a high level of oaa . however the results of the mitochondrial isolates ( p2 fractions ) suggest that the hyperoxia - induced change in complex ii redox state is most likely due to impairment of complex ii itself since for this assay the concentrations of succinate and the electron acceptor ( dcpip ) used were the same for the mitochondrial isolates from both normoxic and hyperoxic lungs and should be in excess of what is required for maximal function of complex ii . \n the measured decrease in complex

hyperoxia - induced increase in the rate of ros formation should have no effect on complex ii . \n since electrons channeled through complex ii produce 4-fold more mitochondrial superoxide than electrons channeled through complex i , the apparent decrease in complex ii activity could be a means by the cells to reduce ros formation under hyperoxic conditions . \n additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of the depression in complex i and complex ii activities observed in hyperoxic lungs on ros production at complex i and iii and mitochondrial bioenergetics , and to determine whether this depression is an injury or an adaptive response to the hyperoxic environment . \n our assumption in this paper is that changes in the mitochondrial pool of nadh is a key contributor to the measured changes in the nadh fluorescence signal since the metabolic inhibitors we used target the mitochondrial electron transport chain . \n fisher et al .   demonstrated that rat lung treatment

{"id": "dev_longform_723", "text": "inositol phosphates are important intracellular \n messengers that \n play a vital role in many cellular functions including cell growth , \n migration , differentiation , apoptosis , and endocytosis . to facilitate biochemical investigations , it is vital that efficient \n routes to these naturally occurring inositol phosphates are established . \n as the demand for key synthetic intermediates increases , so does \n the need for differentially protected entities having free hydroxyl \n groups at specific positions . \n myo - inositol 1,3,5-orthoesters \n have been extensively utilized as synthetic precursors for such inositol \n derivatives , since the o-1 , o-3 , and o-5 atoms can be protected in a single step \n leaving o-2 , o-4 , and o-6 for further manipulation ( scheme 1 ) . \n also , varied patterns of hydroxyl group protection \n can be obtained by the cleavage of orthoesters with reducing agents , and in the case of the alkyl orthoesters , acid hydrolysis can introduce \n an acyl ester at various positions on the inositol ring.myo-inositol orthoformate ( 1 ) has \n been extensively investigated over the years . \n acid hydrolysis partially or completely removes the orthoformate \n ester , since any intermediate formate ester produced is easily further \n cleaved under acidic conditions . \n myo - inositol orthoacetate \n ( 2 ) , which we and others have also explored , has the advantage that acid hydrolysis leaves \n an acetate ester on one of the oxygen atoms of the inositol ring , \n and this can be retained as a protecting group for further manipulation . \n however , such acetate esters are prone to migration under acid conditions , \n and therefore , we have recently investigated derivatives of myo - inositol orthobenzoate ( 3 ) as synthetic \n precursors . \n acid hydrolysis of the orthobenzoate 3 gives a much more stable benzoate ester , which can be directed \n to different positions on the ring , e.g. , c-1 and c-3 by choosing \n suitable conditions and protection of other oh groups and in concert with chiral desymmetrization can lead to \n optically active targets . \n in contrast , apart from orthoformate 1 , acid hydrolysis \n of c-2 unprotected myo - inositol orthoesters 2 , 3 , and 4 unexpectedly affords \n the 2-o - acyl myo - inositol derivatives 5 , 6 , and 7 , respectively ( scheme 2 ) . in a preliminary communication \n , we reported the surprising regioselective conversion of \n orthobenzoate 3 to the 2-o - benzoyl derivative 6 and demonstrated that this proceeds via the intermediacy \n of a 1,2-bridged 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium \n ion . \n we now report full details and extension of this work including \n mechanistic nmr and labeling experiments and show that the resulting \n protected inositol can be used to provide a highly efficient route \n to two emerging anticancer agents . \n orthoacetate 2 was prepared by treating myo - inositol with \n triethyl orthoacetate and ptsa in dmf under reflux as previously reported . \n treatment of 2 with aqueous tfa \n ( 10:1 ) gives 2-o - acetate 5 with complete \n selectivity in quantitative yield . \n this reaction is extremely fast \n and clean with no starting material observed by tlc even after 5 min \n of commencing the reaction . \n our finding that acid hydrolysis \n of 2 leads to the selective formation of ester 5 was unexpected . \n previous studies on the hydrolysis of myo - inositol orthoesters have \n shown that the ester group is directed to the c-1 or c-3 position , \n although in these studies , the 2-oh group was protected . \n interestingly , \n it was previously reported that acid hydrolysis of ( )-4-deoxy - myo - inositol 1,3,5-orthopentanoate gave the 2-o - pentanoate , although the authors attributed this to acyl migration . \n we reasoned , however , that acyl migration could \n not explain the high regioselectivity in the formation of 5 from 2 and a series of nmr experiments was therefore \n undertaken in an attempt to observe intermediates in this hydrolysis \n reaction . a h nmr spectrum taken immediately after \n treatment \n of 2 with deuterated tfa and \n cdcl3 showed \n only the starting material and some 2-o - acetate product 5 , the latter presumably arising from adventitious water . \n a small amount of cdcl3 was used due to difficulty in attaining \n a lock signal in neat cf3co2d . although we were \n unable to observe any intermediates at this initial stage , a small \n change in the methyl peak of 5 \n was seen . over time , the \n disappearance of the methyl singlet at 1.52 ppm and the appearance \n of new peaks next to it and their disappearance was observed by h nmr ( supporting information , \n figure 1 ) , leading us to believe that the methyl group was being deuterated \n giving a mixture of ch3 , ch2d , and chd2 peaks . \n the reaction was therefore \n repeated , and further h and c nmr spectra \n were taken at different times . \n deuterium nmr spectra showed an increase \n in the deuterated methyl peaks ( ch2d , chd2 , and cd3 ) at 1.52 ppm over time , complementary \n to the h nmr decrease in the methyl singlet ( ch3 ) proving that methyl group protons were exchanging ( supporting information , figure 2 ) . \n this was further \n proven by c nmr spectra taken on a different time scale . \n splitting patterns were seen progressively in the c nmr \n spectrum with initially a singlet ( ch3 ) at  \n 23 ppm , a mixture of the singlet and a triplet ( indicating ch2d ) , a mixture along with a quintet showing some chd2 , and a septet showing cd3 . when \n acidic hydrolysis of orthoacetate 2 was carried \n out in other solvents such as ethanol , methanol , or acetonitrile , \n or with use of mineral acids such as hcl , the observed selectivity \n for 5 was reduced and longer reaction times were also \n needed . furthermore , under the selective reaction conditions using \n 10:1 tfa / water ( 50% ) but in the presence of another solvent such as \n methanol ( 50% ) , small amounts of 1/3-o - acetate were \n also obtained . in order to further investigate this high regioselectivity \n and \n also to further understand the observed deuterium incorporation , both \n the c-2 hydroxyl - free and protected orthoacetates 4,6-di - o - benzyl orthoacetate ( 12 ) and 2,4,6-tri - o - benzyl orthoacetate ( 13 ) were synthesized ( scheme 3 ) . \n metal alkoxide chelation - controlled \n regioselective protection of \n c-4 and c-6 hydroxyl groups was achieved in excellent yield when orthoacetate \n triol 2 was treated with lithium hydride and benzyl bromide \n in dry dmf . \n a higher yield was obtained when lithium hydride was used \n in comparison to that using n - butyllithium . \n observation of 12 in deuterated \n tfa and cdcl3 by nmr spectroscopy ( h , h , and c ) again showed the disappearance of the \n signal corresponding to the methyl group of the orthoacetate at 1.56 \n ppm ( h nmr ) and an increase in the height of the deuterated \n methyl peaks over time by h nmr spectra , once more confirming \n that the protons of the methyl group were exchanging with solvent \n deuterium . \n although the major peaks seen were of the starting material \n which was being deuterated , there was a very small amount of hydrolyzed \n product , myo - inositol 4,6-di - o - benzyl \n 2-o - acetate , as well as a minute amount of some other \n broad peaks , perhaps corresponding to an intermediate species . \n this \n other species showed downfield broad signals at 5.91 and 5.72 ppm \n corresponding to one proton each and a multiplet around 4.214.27 \n ppm corresponding to four protons , along with a broad singlet at 2.67 \n ppm corresponding to three protons , perhaps representing a methyl \n group . \n however , since this species was observed only in trace amounts \n by h nmr and not by c nmr , identification \n of this potential intermediate was impossible . \n tribenzyl orthoacetate 13 , synthesized by conventional \n benzylation of 2 , was treated \n with deuterated tfa , and after 15 min , only starting material was \n seen by nmr spectroscopy , and no intermediates or changes to the methyl \n singlet were observed . \n additionally , h nmr spectra taken \n up to 5 days showed no peaks due to deuterium incorporation into the \n methyl group of starting material 13 . \n orthobenzoate 3 was synthesized \n by transesterification of myo - inositol using dmso \n as the solvent . \n distilling \n off the formed methanol ( for example , by carrying out the reaction \n in a rotary evaporator ) shortened the reaction time . \n initial attempts \n to carry out the reaction in dmf at the usual temperatures for orthoformate 1 and orthoacetate 2 synthesis ( 100 c ) \n gave very low yields , and higher temperatures ( > 140 c ) were \n required . \n when dmf was \n used a large excess of both the acid catalyst ( p - toluenesulfonic \n acid ) and trimethyl orthobenzoate was needed , perhaps due to thermal \n decomposition . \n use of dmso as the reaction solvent also gives a much \n cleaner reaction , making the purification easier . \n acid hydrolysis \n of 3 with aqueous tfa gave 2-o - benzoate 6 , once more with complete selectivity and in quantitative \n yield . \n however , when alcohols \n such as ethanol or methanol were used as the solvent , along with longer \n reaction times , selectivity was reduced and 1- or 3-o - benzoyl - myo - inositol ( 14 ) was \n also obtained as a minor product ( scheme 4 ) . \n while we believed that acyl \n migration could not be a result of the \n high regioselectivity in the formation of 2-o - ester \n products , further studies were undertaken to establish that 5 and 6 are not products of acyl migration of \n their 1- or 3-o - acyl myo - inositol \n regioisomers . \n we therefore tested the migratory abilities of the benzoyl \n group in both 6 and ( )-14 under a \n variety of reaction conditions . \n both the ( )-14 and 6 regioisomers were tested individually for the \n migratory ability of their benzoyl group under the same reaction conditions \n used for the acid hydrolysis of orthoesters 2 and 3 ( i.e. , tfa / h2o 10:1 ) . \n however , no products due \n to migration were obtained even after extended reaction times , proving \n that 6 is not a migratory product from ( )-14 . partial migration was observed only at elevated temperatures \n and with much longer reaction times . \n for example , when ( )-14 was treated in 1 m hcl and ethanol at 80 c for 10 \n h , a 6.5:1 mixture of ( )-14 and 6 was \n obtained , while treatment of 6 under the same reaction \n conditions gave a 4:1 mixture of 6 and ( )-14 , respectively . \n therefore , since more of the ester 6 is converted to ( )-14 , the equatorial \n benzoyl ester ( )-14 may be the thermodynamically \n more stable product while the axial regioisomer 6 is \n the kinetic product . after establishing that 2-o - benzoate 6 is not a migratory product of acid hydrolysis of orthobenzoate 3 , further nmr experiments were undertaken in an attempt to \n observe the intermediates involved in the hydrolysis reaction . to \n our surprise , \n the h nmr spectrum taken immediately after \n the treatment of 3 with deuterated tfa showed a new species \n along with product 6 , the latter presumably arising from \n adventitious water . \n proton nmr of the 1,2-bridged intermediate ( )-15 ( labeled as i ) and product 6 ( labeled as p ) : \n ( a ) expansion \n of 3.906.45 ppm ; ( b ) expansion of 7.408.50 ppm . \n no residual starting material \n was observed , indicating complete \n conversion to this novel intermediate , later identified as the 1,2-bridged \n 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium ion \n ( dioxolenium ion ) ( )-15 ( scheme 5 ) possessing characteristic downfield signals at 6.12 and \n 6.29 ppm , corresponding to h-1 and h-2 of the inositol ring protons . \n h-1 and h-2 are strongly deshielded relative to the other inositol \n ring protons , and the coupling constant between them is unusually \n large ( j12 9.0 hz , while j12 1.9 hz for orthobenzoate 3 ) owing to the incorporation of c-1 and c-2 into the five - membered \n dioxolanylium ring . \n the signals corresponding to the phenyl ring protons \n of the dioxolanylium ion are clearly distinguishable from those in \n the starting material or product , being more deshielded [ h 8.408.37 ( 2h / ar - ortho ) , 8.198.15 \n ( 1h / ar - para ) and 7.827.78 ( 2h / ar - meta ) ] compared to those in 3 [ h 7.687.66 ( 2h ) and 7.407.38 ( 3h ) ] and product 6 [ h 8.038.01 ( 2h / ar - ortho ) , 7.747.70 ( 1h / ar - para ) and 7.547.50 \n ( 2h / ar - meta ) ] . in addition , fully in line with the \n values reported for similar dioxolanylium ions and ,-dialkoxybenzyl \n cations , the c nmr spectrum of ( )-15 also showed a signal attributable to c-2 of the \n dioxolanylium ion at 183.3 ppm ( supporting information , figure 4 ) . \n it is likely that the dioxolanylium ion intermediate ( )-15 formed from myo - inositol orthobenzoate \n ( 3 ) is more stable than the corresponding intermediate \n for opening of myo - inositol orthoacetate ( 2 ) . \n this would account for our finding that ( )-15 can readily be observed by h and c nmr . \n therefore , we went on to synthesize the 4,6-di - o - methyl \n ( 16 ) and 4,6-di - o - benzyl ( 19 ) derivatives of 3 , keeping the c-2 hydroxyl group free \n to allow formation of 1,2-bridged intermediate for further studies \n . thus , protection of the c-2 hydroxyl group of 3 as \n its tbdms ether followed by c-4 and c-6 methylation afforded the compound 23 in good yield ( scheme 6 ) . \n finally , \n removal of the tbdms group gave the required 4,6-di - o - me orthobenzoate 16 . \n treatment of 16 with deuterated tfa showed a similar \n dioxolanylium ion intermediate by h nmr for a second time \n with immediate consumption of starting material to give the 1,2-bridged \n dioxolanylium ion 17 ( scheme 5 ) comprising downfield signals at 5.92 and 6.16 ppm , representing \n strongly deshielded inositol ring protons h-1 and h-2 with a large j12 value of 8.9 hz ( supporting information , figure 5 ) . \n c nmr spectra \n further confirmed the structure of the intermediate ion ( )-17 with a signal at 182.9 ppm corresponding to the carbocation \n ( supporting information , figure 6 ) . \n a trace \n amount of 4,6-di - o - methyl 2-o - benzoate \n product 18 was also observed along with the dioxolanylium \n ion 17 . \n chelation - controlled regioselective protection \n of c-4 and c-6 hydroxyl \n groups of 3 was achieved using benzyl bromide to afford \n 4,6-di - o - benzyl orthobenzoate 19 in \n high yield . \n when 19 was treated with deuterated tfa , \n along with hydrolyzed product di - o - benzyl 2-o - benzoate 21 , a 1,2-bridged dioxolanylium \n ion intermediate 20 was also observed . \n dioxolanylium \n ion 20 exhibited spectroscopic data analogous to 15 and 17 with h nmr signals at 6.02 \n and 6.25 ppm and c nmr signal at 182.3 ppm . \n the aromatic \n protons of the dioxolanylium ion were also clearly noticeable since \n they were more deshielded in comparison to those in the starting material \n or product . \n vicinal proton proton coupling constants ( jh , h ) are compatible with slightly twisted \n boat conformation ( see the si for a computational \n molecular dynamics study of dioxolanylium ion 20 ) . \n although it was not possible to observe the initial acid - catalyzed \n opening of the orthobenzoate cage owing to the rapidity of the reaction , \n it is most likely that the more stable 1,2-bridged dioxolanylium ion \n is produced by rearrangement of a 1,3-bridged dioxanylium ( dioxenium ) \n ion intermediate , when the 2-hydroxyl group in the starting material \n is free for instant rearrangement . \n once the 2-hydroxyl group is protected , \n and there is therefore no possibility of rearrangement , only 1- or \n 3-o - subsituted product is obtained , providing further evidence of the involvement of a 1,3-bridged \n dioxanylium intermediate in the initial stages of the acid hydrolysis . \n therefore , \n 2,4,6-tri - o- methylated , 2,4,6-tri - o - benzylated , and 2,6-di - o - benzylated orthobenzoates \n were synthesized to facilitate nmr experiments , with the anticipation \n that the initial opening of the orthobenzoate cage might be observed \n due to the absence of a 2-hydroxyl , thus preventing the formation \n of any 1,2-bridged intermediates or even a potential transient 1,2,3-cage \n structure . \n however , when 24 was treated with deuterated tfa , \n signals in the h nmr spectrum were broadened suggesting \n a rapid equilibration . inositol \n ring signals [ h 5.47 ( 2h ) , 4.554.52 ( 2h ) , \n 4.374.36 ( 2h ) ] were more deshielded in comparison to those \n in the starting material [ h 4.584.56 ( 3h ) , \n 4.284.26 ( 2h ) , 3.67 ( 1h ) ] in just cdcl3 ( supporting information , figure 7 ) . the signals \n corresponding to the phenyl ring protons [ h 8.09 \n ( 2h / ar - ortho ) , 7.87 ( 1h / ar - para ) \n and 7.637.59 ( 2h / ar - meta ) ] were also more \n deshielded , with broadened peaks for ortho and para protons from those in the starting material 24 [ h 7.657.63 ( 2h ) and 7.347.31 \n ( 3h ) ] . broadening of the signals in the c nmr spectrum \n was also significant , along with the disappearance of some signals \n corresponding to inositol ring carbons and aromatic ortho and para carbons as well as the orthoester carbon \n ( o3cph ) , again consistent with a dynamic \n equilibrium ( supporting information , figure \n 8) . \n 2,4,6-tri - o - benzyl 1,3,5-orthobenzoate 25 was also obtained from 3 , and treatment of 25 with deuterated tfa again showed broad signals in the h nmr spectrum with deshielded inositol and aromatic protons , \n especially \n h-1 and h-3 at 5.26 ppm instead of 4.52 ppm and ortho and para protons of orthobenzoate at 8.15 ppm and \n 8.00 ppm respectively instead of 7.237.69 ppm in the starting \n material 25 , indicative of a rapid equilibration ( supporting information , figure 9 ) . significant \n broadening and disappearance / reduction of some signals corresponding \n to inositol ring carbons and the aromatic region of the orthobenzoate \n were also clearly distinguishable in the c nmr spectrum \n from those in 25 , again demonstrating a dynamic equilibrium \n ( supporting information , figure 10 ) . \n treatment of 26(21 ) with \n deuterated tfa yet again showed broad signals in the h \n nmr spectrum , with deshielded inositol and aromatic protons along \n with broadened or lost signals in the c nmr spectrum , \n once more suggesting a rapid equilibration . \n this may be due to reversible \n opening of the orthobenzoate cage giving \n a rapidly interconverting mixture of starting material ( 24 , 25 , and 26 ) and the respective 1,3-dioxan-2-ylium \n ion ( 27 , 28 , and 29 ) ( scheme 7 ) \n . nonetheless , addition of water to this equilibrium \n mixture did not give rise to the expected hydrolysis product , but \n instead resulted in ring closure to reform the starting material . \n this presumably results from destabilization of the dioxanylium intermediate \n due to dilution of the acid concentration , and demonstrates that hydrolysis \n is the rate limiting step of this reaction . since the departing hydroxyl \n group remains in close proximity to the cationic center after ring - opening \n , \n the intramolecular ring closure will be much faster for a such 1,3-bridged \n dioxanylium ion intermediate than addition of water . \n although in principal , the orthobenzoate cage could also be opened \n to give dioxanylium ions bridged between o-5 and o-1/3 of the inositol \n ring in the initial stage of acid hydrolysis , only 1/3-o - benzoate ester products were obtained from acid hydrolysis of all \n 2,6-di and 2,4,6-tri - o - benzylated and 2,4,6-tri - o - methylated orthobenzoates 26 , 25 , and 24 , respectively . however , on one occasion acid \n hydrolysis of 25 in tfa and dcm , gave a minor product 31 in 8% yield where a trifluoro acetyl group was substituted \n at the c-5 position along with the 1- or 3-o - benzoyl \n major product 30 ( scheme 8) . \n this \n unexpected acylation at the c-5 position and not on the c-1 or c-3 \n positions also implies that the orthobenzoate cage may only be opened \n to give a bridge between o-1 and o-3 , leaving the 5-hydroxyl group \n free for esterification by solvent . \n it could be that o-5 may perhaps \n be more easily protonated since o-1 and o-3 are more hindered due \n to the equatorial c-2 substituent . \n this may , in addition , be due \n to the fact that symmetrical 1,3-bridged \n 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxan-2-ylium ions 27 , 28 , and 29 are thermodynamically \n more stable , since conformationally all four hydroxyl groups of the \n twisted boat could attain a less - hindered equatorial orientation in \n comparison to an alternative 1,5- or 3,5-bridged dioxanylium ion intermediate \n that would possess two equatorial and two axial hydroxyl groups . therefore , from the above observations we can postulate that the \n mechanism of acid hydrolysis of orthobenzoate 3 takes \n place via initial reversible ring - opening giving the 1,3-bridged 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxan-2-ylium \n ion 32 ( indirectly observed as broad signals in the h and c nmr spectra of compounds with the 2-oh \n protected ) . this symmetrical , six - membered intermediate then rearranges \n immediately to the more stable 1,2-bridged 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium \n ion ( )-15 , which is then followed by the rate - determining \n attack by water , presumably from the less hindered face , to provide \n the hemiorthoester ( )-33 ( scheme 9 ) \n subsequent decomposition of ( )-33 , under \n stereoelectronic control , affords the product with an axial \n benzoate ester and equatorial hydroxyl groups ( 6 ) . \n however , \n for substrates in which the 2-hydroxyl group is protected , rearrangement \n to the presumed five membered dioxolanylium intermediate is not possible \n and thus slow hydrolysis gives product ( )-35 with \n the benzoate ester at o-1 or o-3 , via a 1,3-bridged hemiorthoester \n intermediate 34 . \n orthoformate 1 was also explored \n under the selective conditions used in opening orthoesters 2 and 3 onto the c-2 position . \n it should be noted that in the h nmr spectrum of the \n orthoformate , the signal that corresponds to the methylidyne proton \n is a small doublet of 1.1 hz due to a 5 bond long - range spin coupling \n with c-2-h . \n an h nmr spectrum taken immediately \n after treatment of 1 with deuterated tfa and cdcl3 showed only the starting material and no intermediate species \n or hydrolyzed products . \n when the same nmr sample was analyzed after \n being at room temperature for 15 h mainly the starting material was \n seen , along with very small amounts of products . \n also , no deuterated \n starting material or products were seen even after 3 days . \n however , \n when the reactions were carried out in deuterated tfa and cdcl3 with a drop of d2o , the spectrum taken 5 min after \n the addition of d2o showed a 50:50 mixture of starting \n material and products , though no other intermediates were seen . among \n the products , both the 2-o - formate and 1/3-o - formate products \n were present at a ratio of 2.8:1 , the \n 2-o - formate product still being predominant . \n analysis \n of the same nmr sample after 30 min showed a starting material to \n products ratio of 1 : 9.3 , with 2-o - formate product \n to 1/3-o - formate product corresponding to a ratio \n of 2.5:1 . \n acid hydrolysis of 1 was carried out \n using 10:1 mixture \n of tfa : water at room temperature for 15 min until all starting material \n had been consumed and the resulting mixture was evaluated by nmr after \n evaporation to establish product ratios . \n the h nmr spectrum \n showed the presence of inositol ( arising due to hydrolysis of the \n formate ester group under the acidic conditions ) , 2-o - formate product and 1/3-o - formate product in a \n ratio of 1:1.7:1.2 . \n ellipsoids \n are represented \n at 30% probability . having studied orthoacetate 2 , orthobenzoate 3 , and orthoformate 1 opening under acid hydrolysis \n and seeing their similarities and differences , we synthesized another \n orthoester , this time with a longer alkyl chain to investigate further \n deuterium incorporation and intermediate cation formation . \n the novel \n orthoester , myo - inositol orthobutanoate ( 4 ) , was prepared in high yield using analogous conditions for the \n synthesis of orthoacetate 1 by treatment of myo - inositol with trimethyl orthobutyrate and a catalytic amount of \n ptsa in dmf at 140 c ( this time due to shorter reaction time \n than for orthobenzoate synthesis under the same reaction conditions ) . \n 4 was then treated with aqueous tfa to obtain myo - inositol 2-o - butanoate ( 7 ) in quantitative yield . \n recrystallization of 7 in water \n and methanol afforded long thin crystals for which an x - ray crystal \n structure was obtained ( figures 2 and 3 ) . \n crystal packing diagram for compound 7 showing \n the \n extensive h - bonding network . \n therefore , from the above results , we can conclude that any \n 1,3,5-orthoester \n apart from orthoformate 1 should selectively open to \n give the axial 2-o - ester product under the above \n acidic hydrolysis conditions as already established for orthoacetate 2 and orthobenzoate 3 . \n this ties in well with \n the rationalization offered by king and allbutt based on the differences in steric strain among the possible \n transition states that fulfill the stereoelectronic requirements of \n dialkoxycarbonium ion formation . \n mechanistic investigations \n of orthobutanoate 4 in \n deuterated tfa again showed deuterium incorporation at the -position . \n however , unlike for orthobenzoate , only a minor species was seen by h nmr , perhaps attributed to a 1,2-bridged 2-butyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium \n ion intermediate akin to ( )-15 which could not \n be fully identified due to the small amount present . \n hence , \n having observed -methylene protons exchange for deuterium \n in orthobutanoate 4 , orthoacetate 2 and 12 using deuterated acid , we can postulate that the mechanism \n of exchange proceeds via a ketene acetal 38 or ( )-40 or both ( scheme 10 ) . \n although , having observed only a small amount of deuterium exchanged \n product and no such exchange in the starting material when tri - o - bn orthoacetate 13 was treated with deuterated \n acid , this suggests that when the c-2 hydroxyl group is protected , \n the equilibrium may lie quite far on the side of the 1,3-dioxan-2-ylium \n ion 37 due to the rapid interconvertion between the starting \n material 13 and the ion 37 . \n thus , when the \n c-2 hydroxyl group is free , the equilibrium being rapidly established \n may lie greatly toward the side of the ketene acetal ( )-40 due to the immediate rearrangement of 1,3-dioxan-2-ylium \n ion 37 to the1,2-bridged ion ( )-39 . treatment of 4 in deuterated tfa \n for 24 h followed \n by the addition of water in the subsequent hydrolysis gave the 2-o - c(o)cd2ch2ch3myo - inositol as the major product ( over 92% ) with trace \n amounts of 2-o - butanoate 7 and 2-o - c(o)chdch2ch3myo - inositol , perhaps arising due to adventitious water . \n therefore , \n any such alkyl orthoesters 36 could be treated in deuterated \n acid under anhydrous conditions for the deuterium exchange to take \n place before hydrolysis to yield 2-o - c(o)d2r ester products 44 with deuterated methylene group \n at the -position ( scheme 11 ) . \n these \n deuterium incorporated products could provide valuable intermediates \n to many deuterium labeled synthetic analogues that could be used to \n study biologically important metabolic pathways or chemical reactions . \n we have also proven \n that this deuterium incorporation only takes \n place before the hydrolysis step and thus before the formation of \n the hemiorthoester intermediate ( )-46 ( scheme 12 ) . \n therefore , once the products are formed deuterium \n incorporation at the -methylene position is not possible in \n deuterated acid . to confirm this , 2-o - acetate and \n butanoate products 5 and 7 \n were treated \n in both deuterated tfa and cdcl3 and deuterated tfa and \n d2o for 9 days and monitored by nmr spectroscopy for deuterium \n exchange . \n no deuterium exchange was observed by h nmr \n spectroscopy over 9 days ; only decomposition and migration products \n were seen by h nmr spectroscopy , further proving that \n deuterium incorporation only takes place via the \n ketene acetal ( )-40 and that no exchange takes \n place once products are formed through a mechanism similar to that \n occupy in migration of products involving a hemiorthoester intermediate \n ( )-46 . \n the efficient regioselective transformation observed \n also facilitates exploitation in the synthesis of inositol polyphosphates \n with 2-position substitutions that are of biological interest as well as providing a proficient route to the \n anticancer agent inositol pentakisphosphate 11 . \n thus , 2-o - benzoyl myo - inositol 6 was phosphitylated using n , n - diethyl-1,5-dihydro-2,4,3-benzodioxaphosphepin-3-amine in the presence \n of 5-phenyltetrazole . \n the commonly used 1h - tetrazole , \n which has potential explosive properties at room temperature , has \n recently become difficult to obtain due to shipping restrictions and \n we found that 5-phenyltetrazole is equally effective as an activator \n in such phosphitylation reactions . \n the intermediate pentakisphosphite \n was subsequently oxidized in situ by m - cpba to afford \n the symmetrical pentakisphosphate 47 in 96% yield ( scheme 13 ) . \n 6 could also be phosphorylated \n with the phosphitylating agent bis(benzyloxy)diisopropylaminophosphine \n in good yield ( 94% ) using 5-phenyltetrazole followed by oxidation . \n after purification of the product , the phosphate protection was removed \n by hydrogenolysis to afford pure 2-o - benzoyl pentakisphosphate 9 . finally , the cleavage of benzoate ester in concentrated \n aqueous ammonia followed by simple removal of benzamide byproduct \n after aqueous work up with dichloromethane provided the ins(1,3,4,5,6)p511 as the ammonium salt in 86% isolated overall \n yield from myo - inositol . \n pentakisphosphate 11 could also be synthesized from 2-o - acetyl myo - inositol 5 or 2-o - butanoyl myo - inositol 7 in a similar method in high \n yield . \n this sequence greatly benefits from involving only a single \n chromatographic purification step thus , eliminating the need for the \n usual ion - exchange chromatography and also allows easy access to multigram \n scale quantities for in vivo studies . \n we anticipate that this route \n can give efficient synthetic access to a range of 2-substituted inositol \n phosphate derivatives of potential biological interest and such work \n is in progress . \n in summary , we show \n that acid hydrolysis of c-2 unprotected inositol - based \n orthoesters , apart from the orthoformate , can lead to exclusive formation \n of 2-o - acyl myo - inositol products . \n this interesting regioselectivity is rationalized through the intermediacy \n of a 1,2-bridged 2-substituted-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium \n ion that is observed by nmr spectroscopy and preceded by a 1,3-bridged \n dioxanylium ion intermediate . \n deuterium incorporation into the -methylene \n group at inositol c-2 of an alkyl ester ( 2-o - c(o)d2r ) is possible when the corresponding alkyl orthoester is \n treated in deuterated acid under anhydrous conditions , with deuterium \n exchange taking place before hydrolysis . \n furthermore , using these \n observations , we describe a most efficient route for gram - scale synthesis \n of ins(1,3,4,5,6)p511 and 2-o - benzoyl ins(1,3,4,5,6)p59 via myo - inositol 1,3,5-orthobenzoate 3 . \n all reagents and solvents either were of commercial \n quality or \n were synthesized and purified in the laboratory using standard procedures . \n some solvents were redistilled and dried where necessary using standard \n procedures or purchased in anhydrous form . \n h nmr and c nmr chemical shifts were measured in ppm (  ) relative to \n internal tetramethylsilane ( tms ) , and p nmr chemical \n shifts are measured in ppm (  ) relative to phosphoric acid as \n an external standard . \n signals are expressed and abbreviated as s ( singlet ) , \n d ( doublet ) , t ( triplet ) , q ( quartet ) , m ( multiplet ) , br ( broad ) , \n and app ( apparent ) . \n all h nmr and c nmr assignments \n are based on gcosy , ghmqc , ghmbc , and dept experiments . \n tlc was performed on precoated \n plates ( aluminum sheets , silica gel 60 f254 ) with detection \n by uv light or with phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol followed by heating . \n a mixture of tfa ( 10 ml ) and water ( 1 ml ) was \n added to 2 ( 1.5 g , 7.3 mmol ) prepared as described , and the solution was stirred for 5 min after \n which time tlc ( ethyl acetate ) indicated the complete conversion of \n starting material ( rf 0.5 ) to a product ( rf 0.0 ) . \n the reaction mixture was then coevaporated with water followed \n by dcm in vacuo to obtain 5 ( 1.63 g , quantitative ) as \n a white solid : h nmr ( 400 mhz , d2o )  \n 2.12 ( 3h , s , ch3 ) , 3.25 ( 1h , t , j4,5 = j5,6 = 9.2 hz , c-5-h ) , 3.57 \n ( 2h , t , j1,6 = j3,4 = 10.2 hz , c-4-h and c-6-h ) , 3.65 ( 2h , dd , j1,2 = j2,3 = 2.7 hz , c-1-h \n and c-3-h ) , 5.38 ( 1h , t , c-2-h ) ; c nmr ( 100.6 mhz , d2o ) c 20.4 ( q , ch3 ) , 69.6 ( d , \n c-1 and c-3 ) , 72.5 ( d , c-4 and c-6 ) , 74.1 ( d , c-5 ) , 74.3 ( d , c-2 ) , \n 173.8 ( s , co2ch3 ) ; hrms ( esi -

{"id": "dev_longform_798", "text": "much has been learned about the properties of qso host galaxies since they were first imaged almost three decades ago ( kristian  1973 ) .\nearly results include establishing a positive correlation between host and nuclear qso luminosities ( hutchings , crampton , & campbell  1984 ) and indications of a morphological difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos , with the former more likely to be in elliptical hosts and the latter in spiral hosts ( malkan , margon , & chanan  1984 ) .\nboroson , persson , & oke  ( 1985 ) , as well as stockton & mackenty  ( 1987 ) examine hosts to classify them spectroscopically and in the context of their nuclear emissions .\nworking in the near - infrared , where the luminosity contrast is more favorable to the host galaxy , dunlop et al .\n( 1993 ) show that qso hosts are typically drawn from the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ( in agreement with hutchings et al .  1984 ) .\nmcleod & rieke  ( 1994a , b ) , also using near - infrared data , find that hosts of radio - quiet qsos are typically represented by an exponential ( spiral disk ) light profile ( in agreement with malkan et al .  1984 ) , and that high - luminosity qsos generally have brighter hosts than low - luminosity qsos ( in agreement with hutchings et al .  1984 ) .\nhigh - resolution space - based images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) make observing the host galaxy much easier .\nthe first , and to date one of the largest , systematic _ hst _ studies of qso hosts is by bahcall , kirhakos , & saxe  ( 1997 ) , who study 20 of the most luminous nearby qsos .\nthey can discern the morphology of the hosts , and they discover that , while radio - loud qsos are found only in ellipticals or interacting systems , radio - quiet qsos can be in ellipticals , spirals or interacting systems . they also find that qso hosts do not follow a schechter  ( 1976 ) luminosity function and are instead found at systematically high luminosities .\nmore recent studies strengthen and expand on these results .\nmclure et al .\n( 1999 ) confirm that qso hosts are generally luminous , and also determine that , even for radio - quiet qsos , the hosts are often ellipticals or bulge - dominated .\nfurthermore , elliptical hosts appear to follow the same luminosity - surface brightness relation as field elliptical galaxies ( hamabe & kormendy  1987 ) .\nother recent studies include nolan et al .\n( 2001 ) , who discuss qso host ages , and kukula et al .\n( 2001 ) , who study host evolution from redshifts of @xmath16 to the local universe .\nin this paper we focus on the luminosity distribution of a large sample of qso hosts observed with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard _ hst _ (  [ sec : sample ] ) . we have collected and reanalyzed wide - band archival images of 71 qsos with @xmath17 mag ( total nuclear @xmath18 host light ) and redshifts @xmath19\nwe have taken an inclusive approach in our sample selection , imposing no additional selection criteria on the qsos besides those of total absolute magnitude and redshift , while some of the previous work on qso hosts has focused on specific classes of qsos : radio loud ( lehnert et al .\n1999 ) , intrinsically very bright ( bahcall et al .\n1997 ) , and so on . for each we have subtracted the nuclear light component using two - dimensional image fits and have derived the luminosity and size of the underlying host galaxy by fitting both an @xmath20 and an exponential light profile (  [ sec : measurements ] ) .\ngiven the total number of objects considered , more than triple that of previous studies , we can effectively sample the general qso population for redshifts @xmath21 , and derive a global luminosity function for their host galaxies (  [ sec : lumfun ] ) that is not grossly affected by selection criteria .\nthis luminosity function is compared with that of normal galaxies , and selection effects / biases and other issues are discussed (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .\nconclusions are then summarized (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .    throughout this paper , we adopt a friedman cosmology with @xmath22 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath23 , and @xmath5 . we have converted the results of other researchers to this cosmology when comparing our results to theirs .\nwe confirm previous results that host galaxies of qsos are significantly more luminous than typical luminous @xmath12 galaxies , where @xmath12 is the `` knee '' in the schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function .\nwe also consider the relationship between host morphology and qso radio loudness .\nspiral hosts are , on average , nearly as luminous as elliptical hosts , while hosts of radio - loud qsos are , on average , about 0.5 magnitudes brighter than hosts of radio - quiet qsos .\nsubject to systematic uncertainties in normalization procedures , we find that the combined low - redshift qso host luminosity function has a very different shape from that of normal galaxies but that they coincide at the highest luminosities . in approximate terms , at redshift @xmath15\nthe ratio of the number of these qso hosts to the number of normal galaxies of luminosity @xmath10 is @xmath24 , where @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath25 .\nour sample includes 71 qsos with total magnitudes @xmath26 and redshifts @xmath27 with available wfpc2 observations in wide - band filters .\nthe objects are listed in table  [ table : obslist ] , along with the _ hst _ programs under which they were obtained .\nthe median redshift of this sample is @xmath28 , close to the mid - point of the range considered .\nthe two - thirds of the sample surrounding the median point falls within the range @xmath29 . we have analyzed or reanalyzed _ hst _ archival imaging observations in a systematic and uniform manner , and the results\nare reported in table  [ table : obslist ] .\ncomparisons are made between the magnitudes we determine and the results of the original observers in  [ sec : comparisons ] .\nthe absolute magnitude selection ( @xmath30 ) aims at including only historically traditional qsos .\nhowever , since the selection is based on the combined magnitude of the host and nucleus , lower - luminosity nuclei , down to @xmath31 , are in fact included in our sample .\nwe have not excluded these objects from our analysis since they would be present in most magnitude - selected ground - based samples .\nwe limit our analysis to objects with @xmath32 , in order to obtain a significant sample size and to ensure that the _ hst _ resolution permits a reasonably reliable separation between a host and nuclear component . at @xmath33 , a typical host with a half - light radius of 9\nkpc has an apparent radius of @xmath34 , which corresponds to 14 pixels in the wide field camera ( wfc ) or 31 pixels in the planetary camera ( pc ) .\nthe light from a luminous host should therefore be clearly separated from that of the nucleus .\nin fact , the host galaxy can not be convincingly detected in only one of the 71 qsos in our sample ; this one is listed as such in table  [ table : obslist ] .\nradio - loudness data are collected primarily from brinkmann et al .\n( 1997 ) and yuan et al .\n( 1998 ) , both of whom use a loudness criterion that classifies an object as radio - loud if it has a radio - to - optical flux density ratio in excess of 10 .\nradio - loudness data for the remaining objects come from a variety of sources , with extensive use made of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .\neven at _ hst _ resolution , the light of the unresolved nuclear central source significantly affects the extended light distribution of the host galaxy .\na careful subtraction of the central point source is needed in order to measure the properties of the host accurately .\nthe following is a brief description of our technique , which is largely similar to that of remy et al .\n( 1997 ) .    because of the complex structure of the _ hst _ wfpc2 point spread function ( psf ) , our analysis procedure has three principal steps : ( 1 ) a model of the psf is fitted to the central point source , in order to determine its subpixel position and the telescope focus , which affects the shape of the psf .\n( 2 ) the psf and a galaxy model are simultaneously fitted to the entire image to distinguish the nuclear and host components .\n( 3 ) the nuclear magnitude is determined from the psf model\n. then the fitted psf is subtracted , and the magnitude of the host is determined from the residual light .\nthe fitting of a model psf , as opposed to an observed psf , is dictated by both opportunity and quality considerations .\nsince we rely on archival data , in most cases we do not have a psf observation taken at the same time as the qso image .\nthe psf in wfpc2 varies with time as a consequence of short and long term changes in the telescope focus .\nthus , using a psf observed at other times does not generally yield a good subtraction of the nuclear light .\nalso , the undersampled nature of wfpc2 images make psf subtraction very difficult , unless both psf and image have been properly dithered . under these circumstances ,\na cleaner psf subtraction can be achieved by using a model psf produced by the tinytim software ( krist & burrows  1995 ) , provided both focus and subpixel positions are explicitly fitted ( remy et al .\n1997 ; surdej et al .\nthis also results in photometry that is comparable in accuracy to using an observed psf .\nthe model psf is constructed from a set of artificial psfs , created using the tinytim software ( krist & hook  1999 ) .\ntinytim uses a detailed model of the telescope and camera optics , including the zonal errors in the primary and secondary mirrors , to produce a good wavelength - dependent approximation of the resulting psf .\nhowever , the psf structure changes significantly depending on both the telescope focus and on exactly how the point source is centered with respect to the pixel grid .\nthe telescope focus changes with time due to `` breathing , '' which is the thermal expansion and contraction of the spacecraft due to changes in its attitude relative to the sun .\nbreathing typically changes the relative positions of the primary and secondary mirrors by about @xmath35 .\ntherefore , we produce psf models oversampled 11 times , _\ni.e. _ , on virtual pixels 11 times smaller in area than actual detector pixels , and for focus positions that range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in @xmath38 steps .\neach psf is then aligned with various offsets with respect to the true pixel grid and resampled to the actual detector resolution , including the estimated pixel spread function described in the tinytim documentation .\nthe best fit to the light distribution in the central few pixels identifies the subpixel position and the estimated focus of the observation .\nif the psf is not saturated , we can achieve a precision of @xmath39 pixels in the central position and @xmath40 in the focus position , for qsos dominated by their nuclei . during this procedure ,\nthe light of the extended galaxy , which varies little over the scale of the psf , is treated as a constant background .    in some cases , several of the pixels at the core\nare overexposed and saturated on the ccd .\nthese pixels provide no information and are masked from all fits .\nthe pixels vertically adjacent to them are also masked , because the ccd `` blooming '' effect could have altered those pixels intensity values .\nour technique works in the presence of saturation , although the focus position is determined less accurately .\nmost images have either no saturation or a small amount that does not completely cover the psf core .\nonce the position and focus have been found , a psf of angular size large enough to cover the host image is created with these parameters , and it is used in the subsequent analysis .\na second two - dimensional fit distinguishes the light of the qso from that of the resolved host galaxy , simultaneously fitting both parts . in this step ,\nthe model psf s brightness is scaled to match the qso nuclear brightness , while a galaxy model is fitted to the host .\nthe host model accounts for ellipticity , position angle , brightness , size , and a simple morphological classification based on radial profile .\nwe consider two surface brightness models , each of which is convolved with the psf : the de vaucouleurs @xmath20 law , @xmath41}$ ] , which is typical of elliptical galaxies , and the exponential law , @xmath42}$ ] , typical of spirals .\nhere , @xmath43 is the elliptical radius , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are aligned with the major and minor axes of the ellipse , respectively , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the semi - major axis and @xmath49 is the semi - minor axis .\nthe half - light radius @xmath50 is the elliptical radius enclosing half the total light as projected onto the sky ; for the exponential model , @xmath51 .    in six cases , namely pg  0052@xmath18251 , mrk  1014 , pks  0736@xmath1801 , 3c  215 , lbqs  1222@xmath181010 and pg  1402@xmath18261\n, the automated fitting procedure does not produce a good match to the central point source , most often because of complex host features at very small radii .\nfor these cases , we manually subtract an increasingly luminous central point source until the residuals are smooth .\nconsequently , the resulting nuclear and host magnitudes for these objects are somewhat subjective and more uncertain .\nfor @xmath52% of the objects , the host morphology is assigned simply on the basis of the best - fitting ( lowest @xmath53 ) model : elliptical if the @xmath20 model fits best , spiral if the exponential model does .\nwe overrule the automatic classification in seven cases .\nfour hosts , those of pks  0312@xmath5477 , pks  1004@xmath1813 , pg  1216@xmath18069 , and pg  1358@xmath1804 , yield a spiral classification after the automated fit , but plots of their radial profiles ( figure  [ fig : four - prof ] ) show them to follow an @xmath55 law more closely overall [ _ i.e. _ , plotting log(counts ) vs. @xmath55 yields a straight line ] , and they show no evidence of spiral arms .\nthey are reclassified as ellipticals , and their @xmath55 models are used in our subsequent analysis .\nthree hosts , those of mrk  1014 , pg  1309@xmath18355 and ms  2159.5@xmath545713 , have their radial profiles outside their central bulges well represented by the @xmath55 law , yet they show clear evidence of spiral arms .\nthey are thus classified as spiral , although their best - fitting @xmath55 models are used in the analysis .\nnote that we are able to identify late - type spiral structure in hosts at redshifts as high as @xmath56 .\nexcept for these seven cases , we keep the morphological assignments determined by the best - fitting models .    for spiral hosts with a visible bulge , we use masks to fit the bulge and disk separately .\nthe bulge is fitted first , and its model is subtracted from the entire image before the disk is fitted . bars , if present , are masked out of the fit altogether , though they are used in determining the host s total magnitude .\nbased on visual inspection , some hosts appear to have undergone recent , strong interactions that have severely distorted their appearances from those of a normal elliptical or spiral , and we have noted these in table  [ table : obslist ] .\ntwo qsos in this sample have a nucleus not concentric with the main part of the host , 3c  48 and ir\n0450 - 2958 . both of these appear to have undergone severe interactions with other galaxies and are left with disrupted hosts and offset nuclei .\nthere are several other cases of hosts that have undergone interactions , such as q  0316 - 346 , pg  1012 + 008 , and pks  2349 - 014 , but these still have a nucleus centered within the host .      using the fitted parameters , we then subtract the properly scaled psf from the qso image , leaving the host galaxy .\nthe magnitude of the nucleus is measured directly from the scaled psf model .\nthe light of the psf model is measured within an aperture of radius @xmath57 .\nan aperture correction of 0.10 magnitudes is subtracted ( voit 1997 ) , and the result is used for the nuclear apparent magnitude .\nthe host magnitude is measured from the psf - subtracted image , within an aperture large enough to encompass the visible extent of the host . outside the aperture\n, we extrapolate the _ host model _ to a radius of infinity and add this contribution to the light contained within the aperture , yielding the apparent magnitude of the host galaxy .\nthe measurements are not based on the models alone because the host profiles often deviate from strict @xmath55 or exponential laws , creating noticeable differences between magnitudes derived from the model alone and magnitudes obtained in the way described above .\nfor some objects , we find differences between our host magnitudes and those of other researchers that may be due to their having derived the magnitudes from the host model alone ( see  [ sec : compmethod ] and  [ sec : comparisons ] ) .    with the exception of mrc  0022@xmath54297 ( which was observed with the f336w filter )\n, the observations were made in wfpc2 f606w or redder filters .\nthe measured apparent magnitudes of the nuclei and hosts are transformed to rest frame @xmath58 .\nthey are then converted to absolute magnitudes in our adopted cosmology and reported in table  [ table : obslist ] .    in calculating the absolute @xmath58 magnitudes ,\nthe apparent @xmath58 magnitudes are first obtained by applying a color correction .\ncolors for the nuclei are interpolated in redshift from cristiani & vio  ( 1990 ) , who provide @xmath59 and @xmath60 as functions of the redshift , @xmath61 ( where @xmath6 corresponds closely to @xmath62 and @xmath7 to @xmath63 ) .\nwe obtain colors for @xmath64 and @xmath65 by treating these filters as linear combinations of @xmath58 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .\nwe calculate the combinations using the iraf synphot package and a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath66 , with @xmath67 . for the @xmath68 filter , we use @xmath69 , and for the @xmath70 filter , @xmath71 . for @xmath6-band images of redshift @xmath72 and @xmath7-band images of redshift @xmath73 , cristiani & vio ( 1990 )\nhave no color data .\nwe therefore take @xmath74 and @xmath75 , calculated using the above power - law spectrum .\ngalaxy colors are interpolated in redshift from fukugita et al .\nbecause we do not classify the spiral galaxies into more detailed morphologies , we average together the colors given for the s0 and all spiral categories in fukugita et al .\nthere are noticeable differences in the @xmath76 colors of s0 and scd galaxies at higher redshifts . at a redshift of @xmath77 ,\nthe maximum deviation from the average is @xmath78 mag , but this grows to @xmath79 mag at a redshift of @xmath80 .\nthe other spiral colors have much smaller differences .\nonce we have the apparent @xmath58 magnitudes , the absolute @xmath58 magnitudes are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath58-band k - correction , and @xmath83 is the galactic reddening .\nthe individual absolute magnitudes here account for galactic extinction , using the data from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  ( 1998 ) and interpolated by the galactic extinction calculator on the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .\nthe unweighted and weighted host luminosity distributions use the extinction - corrected magnitudes , but the host luminosity function uses the uncorrected magnitudes .\nthis is done to allow a direct comparison with the luminosity function of metcalfe et al .\n( 1998 ) , which does not account for galactic extinction .\nwe interpolate the nuclear k - corrections in redshift from the data of cristiani & vio  ( 1990 ) . for galaxy k - corrections ,\nwe use the data of pence  ( 1976 ) which assumes no intrinsic reddening in the host galaxies .\npence  ( 1976 ) combines e and s0 morphologies into a single category and subdivides spiral galaxies into multiple categories . following our decision with spiral galaxy colors , we average the k - corrections for all s - types , including s0 . at a redshift of @xmath84 ,\nthe maximum deviation from this average is @xmath85 mag , and at a redshift of @xmath86 , this increases to @xmath87 mag .\nthe analysis techniques used by others in studies with criteria similar to our own are sometimes different in minor ways .\nfor example , the method of bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) uses stellar psfs taken at the time of the observations , while we generally can not .\nthey observe a set of four stars for the psfs , chosen to have colors similar to qsos .\nthe psf is subtracted by scaling it until the @xmath88 between it and the qso image is minimized .\nthe best - fitting of the four psf stars is used in each case .\nelliptical and spiral host models are then fitted to the residual in an annular region @xmath89 , avoiding the core of the qso .\nbahcall et al .  ( 1997 ) try one- and two - dimensional models , and adopt the two - dimensional results in the end .\nmclure et al .  ( 1999 ) also use stellar observations for the psfs in their analysis , employing two - point dithering to improve the sampling ( and therefore the subpixel centering ) , with the psf stars being chosen to match closely the typical @xmath90 colors of qsos .\ntheir host fitting technique is similar to ours , with the host and qso being fitted simultaneously .\nthey use a two - dimensional host model , assuming either a strict @xmath55 or exponential law profile , and varying the host model s size , luminosity , ellipticity and position angle , as well as the nuclear luminosity .\nseparately , they try the technique of using a model with the radial profile having a variable exponent , @xmath91 .\na true exponential law would have @xmath92 , and a de vaucouleurs law would appear as @xmath93 .\nthey achieve similar classifications using this technique , but their adopted @xmath94 values are based on the former method .\nwith 70 detected qso hosts in our sample , we are able to investigate the properties of the host galaxy luminosity function quantitatively and consider issues related to host morphology and radio loudness .    as noted in \n[ sec : sample ] , the host of one qso is not convincingly detected ; this one , mrc  0022@xmath54197 , is a radio - loud qso and is the only qso observed in the f336w filter ( approximately johnson @xmath8 ) . importantly , this is also the qso in our sample with the faintest apparent magnitude , @xmath95 , according to vron - cetty & vron  ( 1998 ) . for one spiral ( ms  2159.5@xmath545713 ) , we have no radio information .\nconsequently , mrc  0022@xmath54197 is excluded from all analyses , and ms  2159.5@xmath545713 is excluded from analyses requiring radio information .\nit is of interest to consider whether the remaining elliptical and spiral hosts in our sample are drawn from different parent populations .\nthis might also be related to possible selection effects and biases (  [ sec : selectioneffects ] ) .\nbelow we consider these objects in terms of a binary classification yielding four subclasses .\nthe nuclear and host magnitudes for these objects , separated by subclass , are plotted in figure  [ fig : mvsm ] .\nthe overall absolute magnitude distribution of the hosts in our sample is shown in figure  2 .\nour sample is divided almost evenly into three subclasses : radio - loud qsos with elliptical hosts ( designated `` le , '' 22 objects ) , radio - quiet qso with elliptical hosts ( designated `` qe , '' 22 objects ) , and radio - quiet qsos with spiral hosts ( designated `` qs , '' 21 objects ) .\nmembership in the fourth subclass , radio - loud qsos with spiral hosts ( designated `` ls , '' 4 objects ) , is rare .\nthe total of these subsamples is 69 because the lack of radio information on ms  2159.5@xmath545713 excludes it .\nfirst we discuss the rare ls subclass .\ntwo of the four radio - loud qsos with spiral hosts , 3c  277.1 and mc  1548 + 114a , are at redshifts @xmath96 and have little detail visible , but both appear to have large tidal arms that may be responsible for the exponential profile being the better model .\nit is possible that they are simply interacting cases and not normal spirals .\nadditionally , 3c  277.1 is a compact steep - spectrum quasar known to have bright , emission - line gas aligned with the radio source , and its classification may have been affected by this feature ( de vries et al .\n1999 ) . a third object\n, 3c  351 , appears to contain a complete ring surrounding an off - center bulge , with the putative bulge following an @xmath55 radial profile .\nwe classify the complete host as a spiral on the basis of the ring structure , although it could be another case of an interacting system .\nthe fourth , pg  1309 + 355 ( @xmath97 ) , has spiral arms but follows an @xmath55 profile .\nits unitless radio - to - optical flux density ratio is @xmath98 ( kellermann et al .  1989 ) . since kellermann et al .\n( 1989 ) classify qsos with radio - to - optical flux ratios @xmath99 as radio - loud , it would be considered radio - loud by that standard .\nhowever , its ratio does lie between the peaks of the radio - loud and radio - quiet distributions .\nfurthermore , its observed 6 cm flux is only @xmath100 mjy , despite its low redshift .\ntherefore , it , too , might be considered a questionable case for a radio - loud spiral .\nthus , with the possible exceptions of pg  1309 + 355 and 3c  351 , we confirm the result of bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) that radio - loud qsos are almost exclusively found in elliptical or interacting hosts , while radio - quiet qsos may be found in elliptical , spiral or interacting systems .\nthe host absolute magnitudes of the radio - loud spirals were found to lie in the range @xmath101 , spread across our overall host absolute magnitude distribution .\ntable  [ table : medians ] presents the median absolute magnitudes of the various subsamples . to check whether the host and nuclear luminosities in each of the three major subclasses are consistent with being drawn from similar parent populations , we apply two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests to each combination of subclasses .\nthe detailed results of this exercise are reported in table  [ table : kstests ] .\nthe individual host magnitude distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : unwlf - sub ] .\ncomparison of the le and qe subclasses shows that their host luminosity distributions differ at a significance @xmath102% , while their nuclear luminosity distributions differ at a significance of @xmath103% .\nformally , the le subclass is more luminous than the qe subclass in both cases . for host magnitudes ,\nthe le median is 0.8 mag brighter than the qe median , but for nuclear magnitudes the le median is only about 0.2 mag brighter than that of the qe class .\ncomparison of the le and qs subclasses shows that both their host and nuclear luminosity distributions differ at a significance @xmath104% , with the le subclass again being the more luminous .\nthe le median host magnitude is about 0.4 mag brighter than the qs median , and the le median nuclear magnitude is about 0.3 mag brighter than that of the qs class .\nthe host luminosity distributions of the qe and qs subclasses are slightly less distinct , differing at a significance of 88.1% , but their nuclear luminosity distributions are fairly compatible , differing only at a significance of 9.2% .    additionally , we compare the host and nuclear luminosities of all ellipticals ( `` e , '' 44 objects ) to all spirals ( `` s , '' 26 objects ) , and the host and nuclear luminosities of all radio - loud qsos ( `` l , '' 26 objects ) to all radio - quiet qsos ( `` q , '' 43 objects ) .\nthe results are also shown in table  [ table : kstests ] and indicate that the radio - loud and radio - quiet objects can be distinguished not only by their nuclear luminosity distributions ( 98.7% significance ) but by their host luminosity distributions as well ( @xmath102% significance ) .\nthe hosts of radio - loud qsos are typically half a magnitude more luminous than their radio - quiet counterparts , and the radio - loud nuclei are also noticeably brighter ( 0.3 mag ) than the radio quiet nuclei .\nthe differences between objects in ellipticals and spirals are less significant , however .\ntheir nuclear luminosity distributions are distinguishable , differing at a significance of 91.0% , but their host luminosity distributions differ only at 60.9% level of significance .\nthe ellipticals are more luminous than the spirals in both cases .\nthe magnitude difference is fairly small ( @xmath105 mag ) in their median host magnitudes , but it is pronounced ( @xmath106 mag ) in their nuclear magnitudes .    from figure\n[ fig : unwlf - all ] we see that the number distribution of our complete sample of qso hosts as a function of their absolute magnitude .\nthis distribution is entirely contained within a range of 3.1 mag , from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , with a median of @xmath109 .\nit can be fitted by a gaussian with a peak at @xmath110 and a @xmath111 width of @xmath112 mag .\nnote that since all but one of the hosts are clearly detected , the lack of faint hosts is not due to a failure to detect them .\nthe 71 qsos in our sample correspond to @xmath113% of all known qsos within the magnitude range of our sample in the catalog of vron - cetty & vron  ( 1998 ; hereafter vcv ) .\nhowever , since our selection of qsos to include in this study is based on the availability of _ hst _ observations , they may not adequately represent the characteristics of all low - redshift qsos .\nin particular , our sample may be systematically biased as a function of apparent luminosity and redshift : nearer and brighter objects are more accessible , and therefore more likely to be selected for study .\nwe therefore apply a simple weighting technique to approximately correct for redshift- and magnitude - dependent selection effects relative to the vcv catalog . however , we note that any inherent biases in the vcv catalog will not be removed .\nthis catalog is intended to be a compilation of all known , published qsos , so it has a mix of biases from the various surveys that make up the catalog . as a result , for example , its ratio of the number of radio - loud to the number of radio - quiet qsos is not the true ratio , but we do not base our conclusions on this information .\nmore subtle biases , such as those involving limiting magnitudes , will remain .\nour procedure for weighting the distribution function to derive a corrected or unbiased distribution function is based on a replacement method as follows . for each of the 982 qsos in vcv within our selected magnitude and redshift range ,\nwe pick a representative object in our observed sample with approximately the same total ( nuclear @xmath18 host ) magnitude @xmath114 and redshift @xmath61 .\nthe representative object is chosen randomly with a gaussian probability distribution that depends on the difference in absolute magnitude and redshift .\nwe choose a gaussian width of @xmath115 mag in absolute magnitude and @xmath116 in redshift .\nthese widths are chosen to ensure that most catalog objects have several sample objects within about 1@xmath117 in both magnitude and redshift ; if the widths are too narrow , regions of the @xmath118 plane that contain few sample objects would yield a luminosity function that depends too heavily on those few objects .\neach object , @xmath119 , in our observed sample is then assigned a weight , @xmath120 , that is simply the number of times it is selected by the random process .\nthe resulting weighted distribution function is shown as the unshaded histogram in figure  [ fig : wlf ] .\nthe error bars reflect the nominal counting error defined as @xmath121 , where the sum is over all objects in the bin .\nnote that this error is an upper limit for the poisson uncertainty in the distribution function in that bin , in that it assumes that the host magnitude is not correlated with redshift or total magnitude ; any correlation makes the assignment process less random and therefore reduces the counting uncertainty .\nthe extinction - corrected , weighted distribution function has a shape similar to that of the unweighted distribution , though with a narrower peak , and its estimated median , @xmath122 , is almost identical\n. a gaussian fit to the weighted distribution peaks at @xmath123 and has a @xmath111 width of @xmath124 , so it peaks approximately in the same location as the fit to the unweighted data and has only a slightly narrower width .\nsince the morphologies of vcv hosts are generally unknown , we can not weight the elliptical and spiral distributions separately .\nhowever , we can perform a simple weighting for radio loudness by using the unitless radio - to - optical flux density ratio , @xmath125 , described by kellermann et al .\n( 1989 ) , calculated from the apparent @xmath58 magnitudes and the 6 cm radio flux densities listed in vcv . since these are relatively nearby qsos , we assume those qsos without radio detections in vcv to have no 6 cm flux .\nkellermann et al .\n( 1989 ) classify qsos with @xmath126 as radio - loud and those with @xmath127 as radio - quiet . in keeping with brinkmann et al .\n( 1997 ) and yuan et al .\n( 1998 ) , we choose @xmath128 as a strict dividing line between radio - loud and radio - quiet . under these assumptions , we derive a weighted distribution function of qso hosts , separated in terms of hosts of radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos .\nthese individual weighted distributions are also shown in figure  [ fig : wlf ] .\nthe shapes of the radio - loud and radio - quiet distributions are fairly similar between the weighted and unweighted versions .\nnote that the weighted radio - quiet distribution rises higher than the overall weighted distribution in some bins .\nthis is because they are calculated from separate monte carlo runs .\nwe use the qso luminosity function of boyle et al .\n( 2000 ) to derive a normalization for our weighted host distribution function , turning it into a qso host galaxy luminosity function .\nboyle et al .\n( 2000 ) have analyzed a ground - based sample of over 6000 qsos to derive a qso luminosity function for the total ( nuclear + host ) light .\nthey parameterize the luminosity function in terms of a two - power - law function , @xmath129 } +   10^{-0.4(\\beta_{\\mathrm{boyle}}+1)[m_b - m^*_b(z ) ] } \\right \\ } \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] and use a polynomial function for the evolution of @xmath130 in redshift , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 objects mpc@xmath138 mag@xmath3 .\ntheir data are limited to redshifts of @xmath139 , and at the low - redshift end the data do not span a large range in total absolute magnitude .\nthus , we restrict our consideration to redshifts of @xmath140 , where our sample overlaps with theirs , and to total absolute magnitudes of @xmath141 , extending no more than one magnitude brighter than @xmath142 .\nwe use @xmath143 in the function since it is the average of the range we consider .\nwe note parenthetically that 22 of the qsos in our sample lie within this redshift range and that 12 of those also lie within the above total magnitude range . since the total absolute magnitudes of the qsos in the survey of boyle et al .\n( 2000 ) are likely dominated by nuclear luminosity , we assume @xmath144 .    integrating the two - power - law function over the range @xmath145 , with @xmath143 , we find @xmath146 qsos mpc@xmath138 . over the same total absolute magnitude interval , with @xmath140 ,\nthere are @xmath147 objects in the vcv catalog . dividing the integrated function by 228\n, we obtain a normalization factor of @xmath148 mpc@xmath138 .\nmultiplying our weighted host distribution by this normalization factor and by a factor of @xmath149 to account for our @xmath115 magnitude bin width converts our distribution into a qso host luminosity function in units of qso hosts mpc@xmath138 mag@xmath3 .\nthis qso host luminosity function is shown in figure  [ fig : complf ] .\nwe note that in figure  [ fig : complf ] we also show how removing objects with nuclear luminosities fainter than @xmath150 affects the derived luminosity function .\nhere we elaborate on some of the results of this work .\na more thorough discussion will be made elsewhere when we consider the other properties of the sample in detail .      to compare our qso host galaxy luminosity function (  [ sec : lf ] ) with that of normal galaxies\n, we use the normal galaxy luminosity function of metcalfe et al .\nthe schechter  ( 1976 ) luminosity function parameters that describe their v - band luminosity function in our cosmology are @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 mpc@xmath138 .\nthe host luminosity function lies below that of normal galaxies , as shown .\nthe most relevant uncertainty in the normal galaxy luminosity function is at the bright end , where it is less well constrained due to the dearth of luminous galaxies in surveys .\nthe least luminous qso host used in our analysis is relatively luminous , with @xmath107 , and the median of our qso host luminosity function is at @xmath154 , twice the luminosity of the @xmath155 `` knee '' of the normal galaxy luminosity function .\nthe normal galaxy luminosity function is also shown in figure  [ fig : complf ] , and it is evident that it has a very different shape from that of the qso luminosity function .    the brightest luminosity bin in the metcalfe et al .  ( 1998 ) data extends up to @xmath156 , and their schechter function is extrapolated to brighter magnitudes , as we have marked with the dashed line in figure  [ fig : complf ] .\nin fact , we searched for published accounts of any normal galaxies of luminosity @xmath157 with little success .\nthe sloan digital sky survey has recently released a preliminary galaxy luminosity function ( blanton et al .\n2001 ) , in which the highest - luminosity bin also extends up to @xmath156 .\nwe also searched the literature on brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) . in the sample of bcgs in postman & lauer  ( 1995 ) ,\nthe most luminous has @xmath158 , although disney et al .\n( 1995 ) refer in passing to bcg luminosities as @xmath159 .\nit may be that the @xmath160 region is dominated by qso hosts .\nwe conclude that the luminosity function of qso hosts differs greatly in shape from that of normal galaxies but that they are coincident in the highest luminosity bin , if the normal galaxy luminosity function can be extrapolated that far .\nwe can use the luminosity functions to estimate the ratio of the number of low - redshift qso hosts to the number of normal galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude .\nthe normal galaxy luminosity function is integrated over our 0.5mag bins and then compared to the binned host data .\nthe ratio of the number of hosts to the number of normal galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] , along with a parameterization of the results .\nthe relationship can be expressed as @xmath161 , up to @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the ratio of the number of hosts to the number of normal galaxies , @xmath10 is the @xmath58-band luminosity , and @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath13 .\nthe points at @xmath164 and @xmath165 are drawn with thin lines to indicate that they depend on the extrapolation of the normal galaxy luminosity function , although they are included in the fit .\nwe note that the accuracy of these results is subject to the inherent systematic uncertainties in normalization procedures for both the local galaxy luminosity function and our low - redshift qso host galaxy luminosity function .\nnormalizations of normal - galaxy luminosity functions can differ by a factor of 2 from one study to another .\nthe conclusions drawn here about the comparison of the qso and normal galaxy luminosity functions are roughly similar to those reached by smith et al .\n( 1986 ) in their ground - based study of the hosts of qsos and lower - luminosity agn .\nthe current data are of course better than what was available to them , so we believe that the conclusions are now considerably stronger .\nas suggested by these authors , this ratio essentially represents an empirical parameterization of the probability that a galaxy with luminosity @xmath10 will host a qso .\nit applies in the redshift interval studied here , @xmath166 .      as described in \n[ sec : unweighted ] and shown in figure  [ fig : mvsm ] and figure  [ fig : unwlf - sub ] , the qe subclass tends to have dimmer host and nuclear luminosities than the le subclass , but there is a great deal of overlap . within this overlap\n, there must be some property , other than host luminosity , that affects the amount or nature of the fuel available to the central engine for radio emission .\nthe possible causes of this effect should be investigated more closely by using the members of these two subclasses of elliptical hosts to examine other properties of these qsos , including environmental clues .\nimages in our sample are of heterogeneous quality , because the original observers have chosen a variety of filters and exposure times for objects with disparate properties .\nthe best - exposed images , such as q  1402@xmath18436 and pg  1444@xmath18407 , average up to 15000 e pixel@xmath3 within the half - light radius , for a s / n up to 150 per resolution element ( the full - width at half - maximum of the psf ) .\nthe worst cases , such as 3c  93 and lbqs  0020@xmath180018 , have as little as 200 e pixel@xmath3 , for a s / n of 25 per resolution element .\nadequate model fits can be obtained even in images with low s / n , as shown by the radial profile of 3c  93 ( figure  [ fig : profile-3c93 ] ) .\nwhile noise does give its profile a ragged appearance , the model is not a bad fit overall , and the small discrepancy between model fit and measured profile is not reflected in the object s computed magnitude , which is based primarily on the actual counts rather than on the model fit (  [ sec : extractmag ] )\n. some of the most irregularly - shaped hosts can give rise to systematic differences between the image profile and the model , as in the example of 3c  48 ( figure  [ fig : profile-3c48 ] ) .\nin this case , the host s shape and position , with the active nucleus offset from its center , requires masking irregular parts of the host to allow the fit to converge ; this results in the systematic errors at small radii shown in the figure . but\nothers of these irregular hosts , such as pks  2349@xmath54014 ( figure  [ fig : profile - pks2349 ] ) , have excellent fits , without significant systematic differences in their profiles .\nfinally , figure  [ fig : profile - ms1059 ] shows an example of a spiral host with both the disk and bulge modeled .\na bright qso may be expected to hide a dim host , and the more distant it is , the harder the host will be to detect .\nhowever , we are able to see hosts that are 3.3 magnitudes dimmer than their nuclear qso light ( in apparent magnitudes in the observed wavebands ) .\nvery few of the objects have hosts nearly this much dimmer than their nuclei , and there are in fact only 7 objects that have a host 2.1 or more magnitudes dimmer than their nucleus . in general , considering that the host magnitudes span a noticeably smaller range than the nuclear magnitudes ( figure  [ fig : mvsm ] ) , combined with the fact that we have failed to detect a host in only one case , makes us confident that our host luminosity function is not strongly biased by missing very dim hosts .\nthe ellipticals outnumber the spirals in our sample , making up 62% of the total . however , due to _ hst _ target selection effects , this may not be representative of all qsos in this redshift range .\nfor example , we confirm , with only one or two possible exceptions , that radio - loud qsos are found in elliptical or interacting hosts (  [ sec : unweighted ] ) , while radio - quiet qsos may be found in either ellipticals , spirals or interacting cases .\nthe fraction of radio - loud qsos in our sample is @xmath167 , higher than the 1020% expected for optically  selected samples in this redshift range ( kellermann et al .\n1989 ; hooper et al .  1995 ; hooper et al .\nthis may indicate that we have selected an artificially high fraction of qsos with elliptical hosts .\nbut since qsos in ellipticals are more luminous than those in spirals , our weighting procedure (  [ sec : weightdist ] ) may compensate for this bias to an extent .\nit is unlikely that a redshift - dependent magnitude bias could arise from non - stellar emission from the hosts .\nspiral hosts may contain h ii regions , however most bright h ii regions are masked from our fits and analyses if they are in dim areas of the host .\nalthough less - prominent h ii regions might be unmasked , the rest equivalent width of h@xmath168 , the major h ii emission line , is typically @xmath169  in late - type galaxies ( gavazzi et al .\nin contrast , the wfpc2 wide - band filters we use have much larger equivalent widths ranging from 867  ( f675w ) to 1539  ( f814w ) ( burrows  1995 ) , so the h@xmath168 effect in the host is very small .\nmore important is the affect that broad emission lines might have on a qso s nuclear luminosity , and h@xmath168 is again the most prominent line . in this case ,\nh@xmath168 rest - frame equivalent widths are distributed with a median of @xmath170  and usually do not exceed @xmath171  ( sabbey  1999 ) ; thus this could account for at most a few tenths of a magnitude variation , depending on whether or not the line is included in the filter passband .\nthere have been a few other large - sample studies of qso hosts with selection criteria similar to our own .\nof the space - based _ hst _ ones , the two largest , those of bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) and of mclure et al .\n( 1999 ) , have samples that are included in ours .\nthe sample of bahcall et al .  ( 1997 ) includes 20 qsos with redshifts @xmath172 and @xmath173 , making them among the most luminous objects in the nearby universe . in this comparison ,\nwe use their final results , which come from their 2-d model fits .\ntheir host magnitude distribution has a shape similar to ours but is nearly a magnitude fainter .\nit should be noted that the results of their 1-d fits are brighter than their 2-d fits and give a distribution about half a magnitude fainter than ours .\nthey find that , on average , the hosts of radio - loud qsos are one magnitude brighter than the hosts of radio - quiet qsos , while we find that the radio - loud hosts are about half a magnitude brighter .\nthey also report the hint of a luminosity difference between elliptical and spiral hosts , but they state that it may be artificial , a consequence of fitting the host model to the outer ( @xmath174 ) region of the host .\nour analysis shows only a small difference , with elliptical hosts being @xmath105 mag brighter than the spirals on average . this is true whether using the mean or the median .\nbahcall et al .  ( 1997 ) classify 4 of their hosts as spirals , 12 as ellipticals , and the remaining 4 as interacting or of indeterminate morphology .\nignoring the interacting and indeterminate types , we agree with their morphology classifications , with the possible exceptions of pg  1116@xmath18215 and pg  1444@xmath18407 .\nbahcall et al .  ( 1997 ) classify both of these as elliptical , but we find they are disk - like . in our analysis , they are best fit by exponential profiles , and they contain central bulges , although neither host shows visual evidence of spiral arms .\none of the central conclusions of bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) , that elliptical galaxies can host either radio - loud or radio - quiet qsos , is confirmed by our study .\nfinally , we agree with their finding that the host magnitude distribution is inconsistent with a schechter ( 1976 ) function .\nthe sample of mclure et al .  ( 1999 ) includes 15 qsos with a redshift range of @xmath175 . transforming their results into @xmath176 , using @xmath177 for ellipticals and @xmath178 for spirals ( fukugita et al .\n1995 ) , we find that their host luminosity distribution is narrower ( @xmath179 ) than ours , though with the peak in the same magnitude bin ( @xmath180 ) as ours .\nthey find only two qsos with spiral hosts ( with the remaining 13 being ellipticals ) , while we have a much larger fraction of spirals , 26/70 . but note that we classify mrk  1014 as a spiral on the basis of its arms , while they list it as an elliptical on the basis of its @xmath55-law radial profile . while mclure et al .\n( 1999 ) find that essentially all radio - quiet qsos with nuclear luminosities @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) have elliptical hosts , we find several spiral hosts with nuclei in this luminosity range .\nhowever , our data do show that the radio - quiet qsos with the brightest nuclei reside in elliptical hosts , while those with the dimmest nuclei reside in spiral hosts .\nthis may still lend support to their idea that the correlation between black hole and bulge mass derived by magorrian et al .\n( 1998 ) affects the distribution of nuclear luminosities between elliptical and spiral hosts .    since this investigation uses archival _ hst _\nimages , we also compare our host apparent filter magnitudes , @xmath183 , against those of the above two studies , for cases in which we use the same images .\nthis allows a comparison of the measurement techniques themselves . for the bahcall data ,\nthis corresponds to 16 objects from _ hst _ observing programs numbered 5099 , 5343 , and 5849 ( see table  [ table : obslist ] for the object names ) . for the mclure data , this corresponds to 11 objects from program number 6776 ( but note that pks 2135@xmath54147 is not included in their paper ) .\nwe note in particular that bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) provide the results of both their one - dimensional and two - dimensional model fits ; while they adopt the two - dimensional magnitudes in their analysis , we find that their one - dimensional magnitudes agree better with ours , and thus adopt their one - dimensional magnitudes in the following comparison .\nthere are 27 other objects for which there exist published @xmath183 values taken from the same observations we use .\nthese include the 9 objects observed by boyle ( program 6361 ) and published in schade et al .\n( 2000 ) , the 10 observed by impey ( program 5450 ) and published in hooper , impey , & foltz  ( 1997 ) , the four observed by disney ( program 6303 ) and published in boyce et al .\n( 1998 ) [ note that we exclude pg  0043@xmath18039 , for which the published host measurements are very uncertain , and ir  0450@xmath542958 and ir  0759@xmath186508 , which are published in boyce et al .\n( 1996 ) without values for @xmath183 ] , the two observed by hutchings ( program 5178 ) and published in hutchings & morris  ( 1995 ) , and the two observed by macchetto ( program 5143 ) and published in disney et al .\n( 1995 ) and boyce et al .\n( 1998 ) .\nthe comparisons show that the one - dimensional @xmath183 data of bahcall et al .\n( 1997 ) are on average @xmath185 mag fainter than ours , and the @xmath183 data of mclure et al .\n( 1999 ) are an average of @xmath186 mag fainter than ours .\nlooking at all 54 objects together , we find that published @xmath183 results average @xmath187 magnitudes fainter than ours .\nalthough there is considerable scatter to these differences in apparent filter magnitudes , we believe that at least part of the difference may be systematic and lie in our direct measurement of the apparent host magnitude from the psf - subtracted image , without relying on a simple galaxy model except at large radii . in theory , if the host model fit is weighted inversely to the square of the poisson noise in the image ( @xmath188 ) , the model s magnitude will be slightly fainter than that of the actual host image . in practice\n, we find that our host models are @xmath189 mag fainter than the host magnitudes we calculate in  [ sec : extractmag ] .\nthe host magnitudes we adopt (  [ sec : extractmag ] ) are not affected much by this bias in the models .\n\\1 . we have assembled a sample of 71 _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging observations of luminous qsos ( total nuclear plus host light @xmath190 in our adopted cosmology with @xmath22 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath23 , and @xmath191 ) in the redshift interval @xmath192 .\nwe derive results on qso host and nuclear luminosities and on host morphology , using procedures we have developed , and we compile results on radio loudness . of the 71 qsos , we detect hosts in 70 cases\n. the one non - detection may be due to filter choice ( f336w ) and faintness .\nthe hosts are almost equally divided between subclasses of radio - loud qsos with elliptical hosts ( 22 objects ) , radio - quiet qsos with elliptical hosts ( 22 objects ) , and radio - quiet qsos with spiral hosts ( 21 objects ) .\nradio - loud qsos with spiral hosts ( at most 4 objects ) are extremely rare .\nthe elliptical host luminosity distribution of the radio - loud qsos differs significantly from both the elliptical and spiral host luminosity distributions of the radio - quiet qsos .\nhowever , the latter two distributions are more compatible .\nspiral hosts are typically nearly as luminous as elliptical hosts , and the hosts of radio - loud qsos are typically 0.5 magnitude brighter than those of radio - quiet qsos .    \\5 . using a weighting procedure , we derive the combined luminosity function of low - redshift qso host galaxies . subject to systematic uncertainties in normalization procedures , the luminosity function of nearby qso hosts peaks near the point where the normal galaxy luminosity function falls off .\nwe conclude that the host luminosity function of low - redshift qsos differs in shape from the normal galaxy luminosity function but that they coincide at the highest luminosities . with a qso defined in historically traditional terms ,\ni.e. , total nuclear plus host light has @xmath30 , the ratio of the number of nearby qso hosts to the number of normal galaxies is @xmath161 , where @xmath194 corresponds to @xmath25 .\nthis ratio represents an empirical parameterization of the probability that a galaxy with luminosity @xmath10 will host a qso at redshift @xmath15 .\nthis research has been supported by a graduate student fellowship and a grant from the director s discretionary research fund , both from the space telescope science institute .\nwe made use of the following databases : the hst data archive ; nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ; the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; and nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .\nwe would like to thank sandhya rao for discussions about luminosity functions and comments on the manuscript , as well as

sample with respect to host morphology and radio loudness , as well as derive the qso host galaxy luminosity function . we have analyzed available wfpc2 images in @xmath6 or @xmath7 band ( @xmath8 in one case ) , using a uniform set of procedures . the host galaxies span a narrow range of luminosities and are exceptionally bright , much more so than normal galaxies , usually @xmath9 . the qsos are almost equally divided among three subclasses : radio - loud qsos with elliptical hosts , radio - quiet qsos with elliptical hosts , and radio - quiet qsos with spiral hosts . radio - loud qsos with spiral hosts are extremely rare . using a weighting procedure , we derive the combined luminosity function of qso host galaxies . we find that the luminosity function of qso hosts differs in shape from that of normal galaxies but that they coincide at the highest luminosities . the ratio of the number of quasar hosts to the number of normal galaxies at a luminosity @xmath10 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath13 , and a qso is defined to be an object with total nuclear plus host light @xmath14 . this ratio can be interpreted as the probability that a galaxy with luminosity

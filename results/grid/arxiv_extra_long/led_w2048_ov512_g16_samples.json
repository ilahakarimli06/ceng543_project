member galaxy , not more than 3 mag fainter than the brightest member , occurred within and obtained . � the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature . � the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) . � a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters . � this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion . � however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups . � the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . � if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . � if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . � the shapes of compact groups were first investigated by arp ( 1973 ) who concluded that galaxy `` chains '' were unusually in their study , � sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � for the rscgs , the figure is comparable : for groups of four or more galaxies , barton et al ( 1996 ) obtain a compact group abundance of @xmath34 mpc@xmath3 which leads to a luminosity density ratio of approximately 3% . � for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . � because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . � redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . � for example , the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . � their best - fit luminosity function is deficient in faint galaxies , although a normal field - galaxy luminosity function is not excluded .  � hcg 31 contains five galaxies showing signs of recent starburst activity ( ribeiro et al al . 1980 ) although these authors made no distinction between elliptical and spiral galaxies . � it is difficult to imagine any explanation for this result in which the compact group is not a true physical system . � it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . � it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . � it would appear that the stars stripped from galaxies by tidal forces should accumulate in the potential well of the group . and may be detectable as diffuse light . in an early photographic study , rose ( 1979 ) found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated . � pildis et al ( 1995 ) derived baryon fractions of 12 - 19% . � high - resolution studies of individual groups ( williams & van gorkom 1988 , williams et al 1991 ) showed clearly that the gas is not confined to the galaxies . in two of � pildis et al ( 1995 ) and the three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . these results strongly indicate that at least these compact groups are physically dense systems and not chance alignments or transient configurations in loose groups . � they also show that many groups have evolved to the point that gas contained within individual galaxies has been distributed throughout the group . � in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . � however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity , and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact - group galaxies . � further co studies , currently in progress , should soon settle 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) . � the high fraction of hcgs showing diffuse x - ray emission is very strong evidence that a large fraction of these systems are physically dense , and are not transient configurations or projection effects . although the exact numbers are not final , due to the faintness of the sources and the problems of contamination by sources associated with the individual galaxies , it seems evident that many groups are dense bound systems . � the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties , and the fact that the x - ray properties of compact groups are not inconsistent with those of clusters reinforces this conclusion . � ostriker et al ( 1995 ) have argued that the relatively low x - ray luminosities of compact groups might not be due to a low gas fraction , but instead could be understood if the groups are filaments seen in projection ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . however , ponman et al ( 1996 ) point out that in order to explain even the fainter compact groups , gas temperatures @xmath40 kev , gas temperatures @xmath40 kev and densities @xmath41 @xmath42 would be required . these appear to be the only possible explanations for the 50 and @xmath51 . � here we have neglected a small edge contribution that is unimportant for small values of @xmath52 ( walke and mamon s case 3 ) . � this gives f(x , n ) = n^2 x^2n-2 now , an observer would infer a galaxy space density that is higher by a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 n^2 x^2n-5 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor of 12.0 for triplets ( or quartets containing a physical binary ) , 3.2 for true quartets and 2.0 for quintets . � a key question that remains is the position of compact groups . � a key question that remains is the position of compact groups in the clustering hierarchy . � are compact groups distinct entities ( sulentic 1987 ) or an intermediate stage between loose groups and triplets , pairs and individual galaxies ( barnes 1989 ai 1994 , hutchings 1995 , hutchings et al 1995 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these observations provide support to the idea that tidally - triggered star formation is a predominant factor in the galaxy formation process ( lacey & silk 1991 , lacey et al 1993 ) . in this model disk star formation � occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( schade et al 1995 ) , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath59 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the formation of other systems . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . at the other end of the scale , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a press [ b]ahcall na , harris de , rood hj . \u001c [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . \u001c [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . \u001c [ b]aier fw , petrosian , mb , tiersch h , shakhbazian rk . \u001c [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . \u001c _ astrofizika _ 10:327 -

hap ] , that earlier seemed difficult to distinguish due to their combinatorial similarities ( including the non - reconstructible pedigrees constructed in @xcite ) are distinguished by the class of invariants . is a diploid pedigree_.    thus any general pedigree is a _ haploid pedigree _ ; a diploid pedigree is a haploid pedigree with a pairing of its vertices ( although not all pedigrees admit such a pairing ) .     the pairing in a diploid pedigree is completely determined by the pairing of its extant vertices since all other pairs are determined by the definition .    a diploid pedigree is a haploid pedigree .    an advantage of a purely combinatorial definition of a diploid pedigree is that we can now assign just one sequence to each vertex . from this point of view , haploid pedigrees are pedigrees of sequences , not of individuals    the pedigrees of individuals are diploid pedigrees obtained by pairing sequences in a haploid pedigree .    the pedigrees of individuals are diploid pedigrees obtained by pairing sequences in a haploid pedigree .    the pedigrees of individuals are diploid pedigrees obtained by pairing sequences in a haploid pedigree .    the pedigrees of individuals are diploid pedigrees of individuals    the pedigrees of ic sense .     we illustrate these terms in figure  [ fig - subtrees ] , which shows a pedigree and a spanning forest @xmath29 with @xmath110 ( shown by bold arcs ) . in this example , the unique directed @xmath27-forest @xmath108 in @xmath29 has the arc set @xmath111 ; its clusters are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the root vertices of its components are @xmath114 and @xmath4 . xmath126 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ prop -

they may have vertices of degree 2 , they may be unresolved ( i.e. , they may have vertices of degree more than 3 ) , and they may be disconnected ( two extant vertices may not have a common ancestor in a given directed @xmath27-forest in a pedigree ) . we address them in the following identifiability result , which was originally proved for phylogenetic trees in @xcite in the @xmath266 case .     in this section , we note that the identifiability and statistical consistency of maximum likelihood reconstruction of phylogenetic trees were independently proved in full generality for all @xmath280 in @xcite .     in this section , we note that the phylogenetic trees in the @xmath281 and @xmath282 are independent of each other .    in this section , we note that the phylogenetic trees are independent of each xmath27-forest @xmath339 , we define @xmath340 and @xmath341 by selecting a sufficiently large value of @xmath79 we can make @xmath342 arbitrarily small as in lemma  [ lem -

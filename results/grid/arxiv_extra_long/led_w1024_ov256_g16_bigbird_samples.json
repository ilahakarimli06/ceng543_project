level higgs correction to the running @xcite and the second one is due to the anomalous dimension of the running yukawa coupling . in this paper<n> , we consider a particular model of supersymmetry in which the standard model is supplemented by a higgs doublet , and the gauge interaction is a quadratic contraction of the scalar gauge interaction . <n> pacs numbers : 12.60.jv , 12.15.ff , 14.80.cp . epsf.tex # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive candidates for physics beyond the sm , as it is the only known non -

known supersymmetric kagome model . in this limit<n> , we derive a set of equations that describe the yukawa phases and the supersymmetry - breaking phases . using these equations ,<n> we investigate the structure of yukawa zero modes . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most studied topics in modern physics , both because of its fundamental importance to the theory of elementary particle interactions as well as for its possible application to quantum gravity . since the proposal of susy as a possible explanation for the origin of the elementary particles , there have been many attempts to construct susy models . among the different models proposed<n> there are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , supergravity ( sg ) , minimal and non - minimal susy model ( mmsm)@xcite and minimal sussy model(msm@xmath1 ) ( see , for example , refs . and references therein  we investigate the seiberg - zaks infrared fixed point in a class of @xmath0 supersymmetric su(n ) su(2 ) gauge theories .<n> we show that this fixed point is perturbatively stable and that supersymmetry remains unbroken along the renormalization flow . <n> supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( ssmt ) @xcite is a well - known example of a gauge theory with global symmetries . in this theory<n> the gauge fields are chiral , the fermions are supersymmetric , and the higgs field is the only non - abelian chiral superfield . from the point of view of gauge theory ,<n> this model is closely related to the gauge theory of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , where the gauge field is dual to a higgs doublet . as such , it provides a natural framework for the study of the supersymmetry breaking ( susy ) phenomenology in gauge theories with nontrivial susy breaking . since the discovery of susy in the early 1990 s , a great deal of interest has been devoted to the susy nature of this class of models we consider the su(3 ) yang - mills theory with u(1 ) gauge group and four massless fermion flavors .<n> the gauge group is chosen to be @xmath0 and the fermions to have the same quantum numbers as in the su(2 ) theory . in this system<n> we find a nontrivial infrared fixed point for all the couplings , when the number of flavors is such that asymptotic freedom is almost lost and the fixed point is perturbatively nontrivial . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.lm , 11.15.tk , 12.38.bx keywords : yang -

ion collisions at energies relevant for the lhc .<n> we find that the lfvs are sensitive to the initial energy distribution of the collision products , which can be used to determine the relative importance of the various processes . as a result ,<n> we show that the measurement of the angular distribution of lepton flavour violation can provide important information about the initial conditions and the nature of the collisions . <n> recently , the large hadron collider ( lhcb ) at brookhaven national laboratory has collected more than 100 fb@xmath0 of data , providing a unique opportunity to test lepton universality and search for physics beyond the standard model . in this report<n> , we will focus on the study of two processes which are expected to be important in the analysis of the data : the decays of the @xmath1 and the production of the leptoquark . for the former , a large amount of data<n> has been collected , allowing a detailed study of the decay properties , while for the latter , only a limited amount of information has been gathered . from a theoretical point of view , we present a new method to extract the phase - space distribution of the electron - positron annihilation cross section in collisionless plasmas .<n> the method is based on the use of the phase shift analysis of the collision data , which allows for the study of both equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamics . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the collision of a bose - einstein condensate with a plasma of @xmath0rb atoms . in this case<n> the plasma is assumed to be in the so - called  quasi - steady state . ''<n> we find that the phase shifts of the annihilation cross sections are strongly dependent on the density of the condensate , and can be fitted to a simple power - law . <n> collisions of two or more colliding particles are among the most important processes in plasma physics , since they can lead to either the emission of energetic particles , such as electrons or positrons , or the modification of the properties of the plasma , as e.g. density , pressure , etc . during the collision process ,<n> the particles will be trapped in the collision zone , where they can exchange energy and momentum with the surrounding medium @xcite . we present a new method to extract the phase - shift difference between the perturbative and nonperturbative modes of a scalar field .<n> the method is based on the use of the phase shift information contained in the wave function of the field , instead of its eigenfunction . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of the scalar field in the coulomb gauge . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of the coulombic modes of quantum field theory ( qft ) . in qft<n> the wave functions of the fields are usually expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath0 , which are the complex numbers of the hamiltonian @xcite . for the purpose of the present investigation ,<n> we have considered the case in which the field is described by the wilson loop of the regge - wheeler - zerilli ( rwz ) type . here<n> we will focus on the case where the field has a non - zero phase shift , i.e. , it is quantized in the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) and the corresponding eigen we report on the measurement of the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment ( am ) of the proton in the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) at a center - of - mass energy of 200 mev / nucleon .<n> the results are compared with the theoretical prediction based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model . <n> recently , the results of the relativistic , high - energy collision of two heavy ions ( hics ) have attracted a great deal of interest due to the discovery of a number of new phenomena , such as anomalously large values of the mean - field ( m ) moment of the protons @xcite , as well as the suppression of the coulomb drag on the surface of the ions , which are attributed to the interaction with the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in this letter<n> , we present the first results on the transverse - momentum dependence of anomalous magnetic moments ( ams)of the proton at rhic in the collision of au+au at a collision energy of 100 mev/@xmath1 . to describe the results ,<n> we have used a relativistic mean we present the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to the infrared stable fixed points of the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory proposed in @xcite .<n> we find that the infrared fixed point corresponding to seiberg s magnetic dual is the only one with all nonvanishing couplings while the other fixed point corresponds to the perturbative fixed point of super qcd . <n> we present solutions of the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in the presence of an infrared stable non - vanishing coupling constant and show that all of them have real and positive eigenvalue . in particular , we find a solution with no couplings and only real eigen values corresponding to a fixed point in the infrared region of the parameter space of the theory , which corresponds to a nonperturbative infrared stable solution of the super yang <n> mills theory proposed by s.r.t . and t.b .@xcite in the past few years . as a model for supersymmetric qcd<n> , this model possesses a number of interesting features , among which are : ( i ) the existence of a non - trivial infrared stable eigenmode , ( ii ) a we present a family of infrared stable fixed points for the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory recently proposed in @xcite .<n> these fixed points are classified according to the directions of the nonvanishing couplings and support the proposed duality . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) non - perturbatively coupled to gauge field perturbations in the infrared ( ir ) domain . in this work ,<n> we provide a solution for the ir super yang - mills theory ( ijsmt ) in the presence of an additional @xmath0 gauge interaction , which is shown to be proportional to the infrared cutoff of the theory . as a result , the infrared fixed point for the theory considered in the present work is infrared stable and corresponds to the proposed infrared stable ir dual of super qcd ( sqcd ) , while the last one corresponds to seiberg s magnetic dual and it is the only one with all non - vanishing couplings . for a complete description of the infrared and ir properties of super , super - qcd as well as super - qcd<n> , it is in this paper we consider the @xmath0 supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we find a rich structure of fixed points in the parameter space of the coupling constants . among them<n> there is a seiberg s magnetic dual , a super qcd banks -

mills theories . although the non we derive expressions to two - loop order for the running of the gauge coupling and yukawa couplings for a general @xmath0 gauge theory with complex scalars and majorana fermions .<n> we use these results to demonstrate that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric lagrangian , meaning without fine - tuning the bare couplings . as an example<n> , we consider the case of a nonperturbative supersymmetric electric dual gauge theory . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of modern physics , and is expected to play a central role in the mechanism of elementary particle production at the lhc @xcite . in susy<n> there are many fixed points , each of which is characterized by its own set of global symmetries . at the classical level , susy can be described by the standard model ( sm ) , but at the quantum level it can be understood as a supersymmetric theory , in which the gauge and higgs fields of the sm are coupled non - perturbatively to each other . since the discovery of supersymmetry at the electroweak scale , much effort has been devoted to we compute the one - loop beta function for the running of the yukawa and vertex couplings of the @xmath0 model .<n> we find that the beta function has a non - trivial form due to the fermion leg self - energy contribution from the gauge and yukawa sectors . as a result<n> , we find a finite yukawa coupling , which is not present in the model with only vertex coupling . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.wx , 11.15.tk , 12.20.ds in this paper we calculate the one loop beta functions for the vertex and fermionic yukawa ( or yukawa - polyakov ) couplings @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . in the case of the gauge coupling<n> the result is given in fig . [ tbl ] , where we show that the result for the fermi constant in the sm is in good agreement with the result of the non - perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation . for the couplings ,<n> the rg result is in excellent agreement with , and has been for a long time the correct result : @x we compute the one - loop self - energy of fermions in a chiral fermi liquid using a matrix - product - state formalism .<n> we find that the self energy is dominated by terms proportional to @xmath0 , where the first and second terms in the matrix product are proportional to the current - current coupling and the fermi velocity , respectively . in the chiral limit<n> , we recover the result of sachs and wolff @xcite . <n> recently , there has been renewed interest in the problem of one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermi liquids ( fsls ) , due to their relevance to heavy - ion collision experiments , such as recent measurements of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and recent experiments in alkaline - earth - like ( ael ) superconductors . for a 1d system ,<n> the problem is equivalent to that of an interacting fermi gas ( fig ) with a short - range repulsion and a long - range coulomb interaction , which is screened by the ael in the presence of an external confining potential . we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian system with a coupling @xmath0 , which describes the motion of a particle in a harmonic trap .<n> we show that , in the weak coupling limit , this system can be mapped to a 1d harmonic oscillator . in the strong coupling limit<n> , we derive a closed expression for the 1d oscillator s motional amplitude . using this result ,<n> we investigate the dynamics of the system , and in particular , the damping of the oscillations . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the problem of one - to - one correspondence between classical and quantum mechanical systems @xcite . to this end , it is important to understand the interplay between the classical and the quantum degrees of freedom , as well as between quantum and classical motion . for a system described by a classical equation of motion ( eom ) and a quantum mechanical one ( qm )<n> it is well known that the qm can give rise to classical behavior if the system is initially localized at the origin . on the other hand , for a quantum system<n> this is not always the case : it can also give rise we present a new method for the calculation of two - point correlation functions , based on the use of matrix product states ( mps ) .<n> the method is based on matrix product expansion ( mpe ) techniques , but it is more general and can be applied to any matrix product state . as an example<n> , we apply it to the computation of the correlation function @xmath0 , which is known to be very sensitive to finite - size effects . <n> the ability to calculate correlation functions is crucial for a variety of applications , ranging from the analysis of data taken from microscopy to the study of statistical properties of systems . in this context ,<n> correlation functions play an important role , as they can be used to quantify the sensitivity of various systems to small changes in their observables , such as intensity , temperature , pressure , density , or current , and also to changes in the system s parameters , e.g. energy , charge , mass , etc . here<n> we will present a method for computing correlation functions of two observables in a model system , using mpe techniques @xcite<n> . we will also present an example of we present a new method for extracting the phase - space density profile of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from the measurement of the scattering cross - section .<n> the method is based on the use of an analytic model that takes into account all the scattering processes in the condensate , and is valid for both non - interacting and strongly interacting condensates . as an example , we apply the method to the case of a bec interacting with an atomic condensate . <n> pacs numbers : : we consider the yukawa couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with gauge -

higgs couplings , as well as fermion and bosonic yukawa interactions . among the simplest susy models that have been studied in the literature , there is one that has gained the most attention , namely the minimal susy model ( mmsm)@xcite which is characterized by the following properties : it consists of three neutral particles : a neutral scalar particle we show that the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) can be generated by the decay of the lightest cp - even higgs state , @xmath0 , into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .<n> we find that the branching ratio of this decay is of the order of the sm higgs decay branching ratio . <n> the discovery by the cleo collaboration of a higgs particle @xcite has been one of the most important advances in particle physics of the twentieth century . at present , the sm is the only known particle physics theory capable of reproducing all the experimental data . in order to explain this observation ,<n> the sm has to introduce new particles , beyond the sm itself , which are produced at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for a description of the new particles one<n> has to resort to the effective field theory ( eft ) approach . from the eft point of view<n> , there is no doubt about the success of the theory : it describes the quark and lepton masses and mixings , as well as the masses and couplings of the photons and leptons  we show that , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .<n> the breaking is due to the non - renormalizability of the higgs field , which becomes manifest at the supersymmetry breaking scale and leads to a breakdown of the gauge invariance of the theory . as a result , for each supersymmetric particle , there is an extra , higher - dimensional gauge symmetry that breaks spontaneously . <n> the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental scrutiny since its introduction by t hooft and co - workers @xcite . in this extension ,<n> the sm gauge group is enlarged by the addition of a higgs doublet , so that the gauge couplings of the two gauge bosons become identical . at the gut ( planck ) scale , where the sm is expected to be realized , this doublet mass is of the order of the weak scale and the corresponding susy breaking scale is much higher , up to several tev ",

pillastrini ( 1981 ) relation , the bertin - lin - thurstans ( 1989a ) and contopoulos ( 1986 ) relations , and the spergel - roberts ( 1993 ) relationship . <n> the ned data were supplemented by ccd observations from the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) of the galaxies ngc1399 , ic 348 , mrk 421 , i zw 18 , arp 220 , ugc 4321 , vcc 1407 , wlm 3201 , for a total of 22 galaxies . for each galaxy<n> , images were obtained of the central region and of the following components : major and minor axes , bar length , inner and outer lindblad resonances , corotation radius , central surface brightness  we present the results of hi observations of a complete sample of 14 barred galaxies ( bcgs ) .<n> the sample was selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) based on morphological and spectral criteria , and is the largest sample of bcgs for which both hi and optical data are available . <n> the hi data were obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and cover the frequency range @xmath0 ghz . for each galaxy ,<n> we have measured the hi surface brightness , the hi mass surface density , as well as the total hi surface density and total hi mass within the optical aperture . in the case of the most luminous galaxies in the sample , we have determined the total mass within an optical aperture to be within a factor of two of the stellar mass of the galaxies , which is consistent with the idea that most bcgs have stellar mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) close to the critical value @xcite . however , there is a significant fraction of fainter galaxies which have m /l@xmath1@xcite or lower , consistent with a scenario in which most of the we present a catalog of hi - selected galaxies with distances @xmath0 .<n> the sample was selected from the catalog of hewitt & haynes ( 1983 ) , @xcite , and lindblad & lewis ( 1985 ) based on the hi number density . <n> we present here the redshift distribution function ( rdf ) for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) galaxies , which is based on hi data from the _ hi nearby galaxies survey _ ( things ) and the eso vlt galaxy redshift survey ( uvgs ) ( both data releases are available online at : http://www.eso.org/vlt/gr8/ )<n> . the rdfs for the dr7 and the uvgs galaxies are in excellent agreement with each other , except for the extremely low hi content of the latter two , where the difference between the two sets of data is larger than a factor of two . in general , we find that the hi distributions of the two surveys are very similar , with a mean hi -

pressure neutral hydrogen ( hpn ) in some of the most explored extragalactic helium-3 ( erh ) sources , especially in the vicinity of the so - called  edelweiss phenomenon '' , has led to the speculation that this phenomenon could be related to the long - standing problem of the origin of the anomalously high pressure ( up to @xmath0c / m@xmath1 ) found in many of these sources .<n> although it is generally agreed that the phenomenon is associated with the formation of a new class of relativistic heavy - ion bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , it is not yet clear whether this phenomenon is a general property of erheology , nor whether it is related to specific features of the sources themselves . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in studying the properties of the recently discovered large amount of highly - nh , neutrally ionized helium-3 , detected in a number of sources : e.g. , in erbium-41 , erjupiter - ii , and also in helium-3 itself . in we present a high - resolution spectroscopic study of a highly elongated galaxy ( ngc3968 ) .<n> the galaxy , which has a mass of @xmath0 and harbors a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) at its centre , shows a complex structure , consisting of at least three components : a central bar , a compact bulge , and an extended halo . in the central region ,<n> the kinematics of the extended halo is dominated by the motion of the lbv which is confined to the central part of the bar ; the mass of the central object is only a small fraction of the total baryonic mass . <n> the study of the kinematic properties of bulge - dominated galaxies has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli in the 19th century . since then<n> , bulges have been found in galaxies of all masses , from dwarf galaxies in the early universe up to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of galaxies at the center of the local group . due to the large number of components and the relative smallness of the bulge to the baryons , most bulges are intrinsically non - spherical  we present a new method to determine the number density of multiple stellar populations in a globular cluster .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the density profile of a cluster of stellar remnants , which is then compared to the profile of the cluster as a function of age and metallicity . as an example<n> , we apply the method to two globular clusters , ngc2206 and ngcs0497 , for which detailed data are available . <n> globular clusters are the most massive objects in the universe , with about 10@xmath0 solar masses . despite their large number ,<n> they are poorly understood , partly due to the fact that most of them are very old ( @xmath1 gyr ) , and metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xcite , [ mg / fe ] ) and have low metallicities ( [ si / fe]@xcite and [ s / fe])@x<n> . in order to understand the formation and evolution of these objects , it is important to study the properties of the metal - rich progenitors , especially the stellar remnants of the globular cluster ( gc ) that formed them . it is shown that the relative motion between the two arms of a compact binary system can lead to rapid oscillation of the system .<n> this oscillation can be caused by the interaction of the two components , e.g. , in a binary system with a compact core , or in a compact baryonic cloud . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of binary systems with compact objects , such as neutron stars , stellar mass black holes , white dwarfs , neutron stars and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . in such systems ,<n> the interaction between the components leads to a rapid oscillation , which can be due to either ( i ) a global phase shift of the components or ( ii ) internal dynamics of the component . for the latter case<n> , it has been suggested that the internal dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator , due to the interaction with the internal degrees of freedom of the binary system , for example , by means of the kuramoto - sugimoto model @xcite . as such , the damping of the oscillation is of great importance for the understanding of the dynamics of these systems  we study the effect of multiple stellar arms on the dynamics of a compact binary system .<n> we show that the presence of the secondary star in the binary system has a profound effect on the structure of the compact star , especially on the kinematics of the binary and the excitation of the stellar component . <n> the study of binary stellar systems is an important topic in modern astrophysics , because of its relevance to many astrophysical phenomena , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries , neutron stars , pulsar wind nebulae , etc . in most cases ,<n> the evolution of the central compact object ( the  star '' ) in a binary system is closely related to the properties of its secondary star . due to the large number of possible secondary stars in a given system , it is important to understand the behaviour of the system as a function of the number of secondary stars and their masses . for a given stellar mass , the secondary stars are expected to form a  stellar cluster '' , i.e. a compact object with a large angular momentum , a small orbital angular momentum and a small mass . we study the effect of gravitational redshift on the dynamics of a relativistic particle in a spherically symmetric potential .<n> we show that the gravitational field can either enhance or suppress the motion of the particle , depending on whether it is above or below the top of the black hole s horizon . in the latter case ,<n> the particle can be trapped in the hole and escape to infinity , whereas in the former case it can be pushed out of the horizon and experience a gravitation force . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the theoretical and experimental study of relativistic black holes , due to the possibility of observing the collapse of the wormhole predicted by schwarzschild @xcite , the reissner - nordstrm solution of the regge - gap equation @xmath0 , and the gravitational wave signal produced by the core collapse of a compact star . for a relativistic black hole<n> , it is well known that in the nonrelativistic regime the gravitational force is negligible compared to the electromagnetic force , which is proportional to the product of the gravitational potential and the radius of the hole . on the other hand , in the relativistic regime , when the gravitational we report on the discovery of an extremely high metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) outflow from the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc2627 .<n> the metallicity of the outflow is found to be much higher than that of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , suggesting that the outflow originates from the interaction between the interstellar medium and the swept - up material from the stellar wind of the galaxy . <n> the presence of an extragalactic low metallicity outflow , discovered in a series of papers @xcite , has been interpreted as the result of the enhanced metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( icm ) due to the merger of galaxies . in this letter<n> , we show that the results of the high - resolution spectroscopic observations of two well - studied , metal - rich dwarf galaxies , ic1335 and ic2627 ( both located at a distance of 8kpc ) show that their metallicities are significantly higher than the ism metallicity , and are even higher than local icm values . the results are consistent with a scenario in which the icm forms a dense shell of metal - poor gas , which is ionized we report the results of high resolution optical spectroscopy of the galactic halo objects ngc2535 , ugca , and ugc05685 .<n> these objects are selected to study the radial dependence of the metallicity in the halo of the galaxy . for these objects<n> we have found that the radial metallicity profile can be well described by a power law with an exponent @xmath0 , which is in good agreement with the result of monte carlo simulations . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the metal enrichment in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , due to its possible implications for the nature of the halos and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite . in this letter<n> , we investigate the dependence of metallicity on the radial extent of the distribution of the surface density of the ism in the central part of these halos , in order to test the applicability of the local density approximation ( lda ) to metal enrichment measurements in galactic haloes . to this aim ,<n> we use the  extended lda ' ( elda)@xcite to calculate we report the results of a survey of the circumgalactic magnetic field structure , based on the analysis of magnetic field maps obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .<n> we find that the magnetic field in the range of @xmath0@xmath1 gauss is distributed in a wide range of scales , from the scales of few tens of parsecs up to several hundreds of kiloparsecs . <n> the magnetic fields of compact extragalactic sources are of great importance for several reasons . in spite of their importance<n> , very little is known about the structure of magnetic fields in galactic sources , mainly due to the lack of detailed knowledge of the detailed distribution of the field strengths in the observed data , which are available for only a small number of sources . from the observational point of view<n> it is of crucial importance to have information on the distribution of field strengths across the source in order to be able to estimate the source s magnetic field and hence its contribution to the energy flux in the frequency range of several hundreds to thousands of mhz . for a given source position and declination ,<n> the average field strength is given by the lorentz factor , we study the effect of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) on the x - ray emission from the early - type galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> we find that the isrf leads to an increase of the emissivity by a factor @xmath0 , which is of the same order as that of the anisotropy of the isotropic emission from this galaxy . <n> recently , we have studied the effects of anisotropic radiation fields on the emission from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . in the case of the sn ia<n> , it is well known that the radiation field can be approximated by an isotropic , spherically symmetric , isotropic distribution . however , due to the inhomogeneities in the distribution , this approximation breaks down in some cases , leading to the appearance of extra components in the spectrum , e.g. , relativistic and non - relativistic electrons , magnetic fields , etc . as a result ,<n> the emission spectrum becomes hard and spectral features such as double - peak structure are seen , as well as a number of other features , such as a double -",

dimensional system of bosons with long - ranged asymmetric interactions . using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques<n> we prove the existence of a phase separation transition in this system . the model is studied using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , and the critical exponents of the correlation functions are calculated . as in the case of superconductivity , phase separation results from the competition between the internal and the external we consider a system of @xmath0 particles which interact only through nearest -

body systems is an active area of research in condensed matter physics . in recent years<n> a great deal of attention has been devoted to systems with short - range interactions , such as spin - boson models @xcite , or systems with long - range , like parity - time - reversal invariant ( pt ) hamiltonians , as well as systems with anisotropic interactions ( see e.g. , [ eq : poincar ] )<n> . however , the physics of such systems is not yet fully understood , despite the fact that they have been studied theoretically for a long time . here<n> we present a model of interacting particles which exhibits a number of features which are not present in we consider a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions interacting via a nearest -

known class of hamiltonians that exhibit a phase transition between a gapped phase and a gapless phase @x<n> . however , these models do not have a trivial ground state , and it is not clear how one could construct a  we consider a one - dimensional fermi gas with a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath0 in a two - dimensional square lattice .<n> we show that , in the thermodynamic limit , this system is a fermi liquid with a gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum . in the low - energy limit<n> , the excitation spectrum is gapless , and the gap is closed at a nonzero temperature . <n> fermi liquids ( flss ) are one of the most fundamental concepts in physics and have been intensively studied in recent years @xcite . among other things , they provide a paradigm for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter , such as high - temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids . however , it is well - known that these systems can not be described by a fermionic fls , but rather by an interacting bosonic fl , which is a good model for interacting fermions , see e.g. refs . and references therein . as a result ,<n> the study of interacting bosons has a long history , going back to the pioneering works of heisenberg and bernevig on interacting fermi gases . since then , we show that metastable states can not be created by moving a particle between two different domains .<n> this is done for a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions interacting via a nearest - neighbor repulsion . in the thermodynamic limit<n> , the system can be mapped into a system with three domain boundaries , each of which contains a metastable state . using the density matrix renormalization group ,<n> we calculate upper and lower bounds on the number of excitations of this metastable system , and show that they are exponentially small in the system s thermodynamic limit . <n> _ introduction. _ the study of many - body quantum systems is one of the major challenges in modern condensed matter physics @xcite . due to the large number of degrees of freedom in these systems , it is not possible to rigorously define a universal scaling law for the behavior of the system as a function of the parameters of the hamiltonian , such as interaction strength , interaction range , or density of states . instead , universal scaling laws have been proposed for a few classes of systems . among these , there is a class of scaling laws known as the generalized scaling relations ( gsr  we show that a system of interacting fermions in a square lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions has phase separation into domains of different fermion species .<n> this is a consequence of the existence of metastable states in which the number of particles in each domain is exponentially small in the system size @xmath0 . in the thermodynamic limit<n> this metastable state decays exponentially fast , with a correlation function of power - law form . <n> systems of interacting quantum particles have been a focus of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years @xcite . among the many problems addressed by these studies<n> is the problem of the emergence of long - range order in interacting quantum systems , which has been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and numerical work . despite the intense interest in this problem<n> , it has not yet been possible to establish a rigorous connection between the properties of the steady state and those of the many - body system , despite the fact that a number of exact results have been obtained for the steady - state properties of interacting bosons , fermionic atoms , and even bosonic atoms in a harmonic trap . here<n> we present a theoretical connection between steady state order and the density correlation functions of we show that the walker problem , which describes the collective motion of interacting many - body quantum systems , can be mapped onto the problem of a particle walking in a random potential .<n> we use this mapping to study the motion of particles in a quantum walk in a two - dimensional disordered medium . using a restricted version of the walker algorithm<n> , we calculate the correlation function for the particle - particle and particle - hole correlation functions . <n> the collective dynamics of interacting quantum many - particle systems is a topic of considerable current interest @xcite . in this context ,<n> the phenomenon of walker s motion is particularly interesting , since it provides a theoretical framework for the study of the motion in random potentials , and also because it is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics . as a paradigmatic example , consider the quantum motion of bosons and fermions in an optical lattice , a system which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically , see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein . a quantum walker is a particle which is allowed to move freely in the background of other particles , but at the same time can not hop to any other site in the lattice . for a we study a system of three species of identical fermions interacting via a repulsive short - range potential .<n> we show that the system can phase separate into three domains in the thermodynamic limit , even when the global densities of the three species are not equal , provided the number of particles of each species is not equal and the interaction strength between the species is weaker than a critical value , @xmath0 . <n> the existence of phase separation is one of the most important predictions of the theory of interacting many - body quantum systems . in the simplest case of a two - component fermion system , such as a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite ,<n> phase separation occurs when the energy difference between the two components of the condensate is much larger than the thermal energy , and the two condensates are separated by a finite distance in the bulk of the system . at the same time , in the presence of an attractive short - ranged potential , a phase separation may occur when the interaction between the particles of the second component is strong enough to overcome the thermal attraction of the first component . for a bec of two species , for example , the system is phase separated into coarsening is the process by which a many - body system , initially in a metastable state , evolves to reach a final state in which intermediate metastable states coexist with the original state .<n> we show that the coarsening process can be understood in terms of a two - step process : first , the system is driven out of equilibrium by the introduction of a new species of particles . at a certain time<n> scale the new species , say @xmath0 , becomes metastable with respect to the old species . in the thermodynamic limit ,<n> the system undergoes a coarsening phase transition , and at a second time scale , it is driven back into its original state by the exchange of particles between domains of the same species at a rate dictated by the size of the domains . <n> it has been known for a long time that a system of many interacting particles may coarsen into a state of three or more metastable species @xcite , provided that the interaction between the species is sufficiently weak and the system size is small compared with the domain size . for sufficiently small system sizes , monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of the system<n> can be performed with no additional free parameters . we study the ordering dynamics in a system of three interacting domains .<n> the length of the domain is then modified by carrying out one of the following processes : ( i ) exchange of particles between domains ; ( ii ) addition of a particle from one domain to another ; and ( iii ) annihilation of two particles from each domain . in the scaling limit , we find that the average domain size grows as @xmath0 , where the exponent @xcite is independent of the number of domains , but depends on the dimension of the system . we also find that for large times , the system undergoes a phase transition between a disordered phase and a ordered phase . <n> ordering dynamics is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nonequilibrium statistical physics . at a coarse - grained level ,<n> it describes the collective behavior of a population of interacting quantum particles , e.g. , a collection of spins in a magnetic field , or an ensemble of interacting bosons in a lattice , as the system is driven out of equilibrium by the coupling between them . on the other hand , at a macroscopic level<n> , it describes macroscopic behavior of the population of a large number of microscopic species , we introduce a mean - field version of a three - species toy model of ordering dynamics in one - dimensional systems .<n> the model is studied by numerical simulation and by the derivation of the growth law of the smallest domains . in the thermodynamic limit<n> we calculate the partition function and the correlation function of the model . <n> the ordering dynamics of a system of two or three species has been the subject of many studies in physics , chemistry , biology and computer science @xcite . for three or more species ,<n> it has been shown that the system undergoes a transition from a disordered state to an ordered state , depending on the strength of the coupling between the species and on the properties of the system , such as the dimensionality of space and time , as well as on the concentration of the species . on the other hand , in a system with one species only , the transition can be first or second order depending on whether the species is homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and whether the coupling is weak or strong . here<n> we consider a toy model in which the three species are allowed to form domains of different length @xmath0 , irrespective of the type of particle they consist of . the the partition function , correlation function and steady - state weight of a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate are calculated using a matrix ansatz .<n> the results are used to study the scaling near the critical point @xmath0 ( infinite temperature ) of the correlation function in small systems . <n> the study of condensates in one dimension has a long history , going back to the work of berezinskii , kosterlitz , and thouless @xcite . in recent years<n> , condensates have been studied in a variety of physical contexts , ranging from condensed matter to atomic and molecular physics , as well as in nuclear and particle physics . however , it is well - known that condensates are non - equilibrium systems , _<n> i.e. _ they do not obey equilibrium statistical mechanics . as a consequence ,<n> the properties of such systems are not well understood , even in the thermodynamic limit , where the system size diverges . for instance , in condensed matter , there is no mean - field theory to describe how a condensate evolves in time , nor is there a universal scaling law for the behavior of a macroscopic system . we present a new approach to the steady - state properties of many - body quantum systems .<n> the approach is based on the use of a deformed commutator between a tensor product and a vector space , which allows us to obtain the partition function as a function of the number of particles in the system . as an application we consider a system of classical point particles interacting via a harmonic potential . in this case<n> we show that it is possible to obtain a closed form expression for the steady state energy . <n> it has been known for some time that a quantum system with a large number of interacting particles can be described by a set of tensors @xmath0 , each of which is a so - called  steady state weight ' @xcite . for a system with periodic boundary conditions ,<n> the  tensor ensemble ' is the ensemble of all possible steady states of the system defined by a single set of commutation relations . using these relations<n> one can show that the total weight of a system can be written as the sum of a  density weight ' and an  energy weight ' . the density weight is the energy that the system would have if it were in a steady state . we derive a tensor ansatz for the partition function of systems with periodic boundary conditions .<n> we show that the tensor an satz allows for the calculation of all correlation functions of interest , including the correlation function which measures the phase separation in the system . <n> the study of phase separation has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli , wigner , and dyson @xcite . in recent years<n> it has been recognized that phase separation can occur in a wide variety of physical systems , ranging from solid state systems to colloidal suspensions @xmath0 . for sufficiently large systems<n> the phase transition is first order , but it can be continuous , or continuous with critical exponents different from those of the ising universality class . at the same time<n> , it is well known that systems with a periodic boundary condition can undergo a first order phase transition to a phase separated state , provided the system size is sufficiently large . here , we derive an anstze for the tensor partition function , which allows for calculation of the correlation functions , in particular , of interest to those systems for which the first order transition is not possible . using this ans we propose a phase separation criterion for a model of a collection of interacting particles with detailed balance .<n> we argue that the system phase separates into a configuration where only stable domains are present , as long as the densities of particles of each species are non -

particle interactions are short ranged , repulsive , and non - zero . according to the argument presented in we study a simple one - dimensional model of particles interacting via a nearest - neighbor random sequential exchange dynamics .<n> we show that the steady - state phase diagram of this model exhibits a first - order phase transition between an ordered phase and a disordered phase . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @xcite , where we studied a mean - field model of hard - core bosons in one dimension . in that paper , we considered a model of bosons interacting through a random sequential dynamics , and studied the phase diagram as a function of the strength of the interaction . here ,<n> we study the same model in a more general context , namely , in the presence of a non - equal density of particles in the bulk , which is the case in a large class of physical systems . using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , developed in @xmath0 , as well as the replica trick , used in the analysis of the nrg data<n> , it is possible to calculate the steady state of the present model , its phase diagram and the order of the transition between the ordered we consider a one -

infrared ( nir ) continuum . <n> the millimeter , submillimeter , and millimeter - nir data span timescales from minutes to years and are consistent with each other , with no evidence for significant variations in the spectral index , variability amplitude , or mean flux density . on the other hand we present new vla , alma , and sma observations of sgr a*. over the past 30 years , the millimeter / submillimeter spectral index has remained remarkably stable , with no evidence for enhanced emission caused by the passage of g2 .<n> this stability is consistent with the long - term stability of the radio through millimeter spectrum , which indicates that g2 has not been significantly disrupted . in the case of low - frequency emission ,<n> the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole . the millimeter spectrum is likely to originate from a stratified region with optical depth in transition between optically thick and thin . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : active ; quasars : general ; x -

phonon coupling . at high temperatures , we observe a decrease in both the number and the character of the low - energy dos as a function of temperature . <n> the study of strongly correlated electron systems has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of davis , lamb , and ross @xcite in the 1960 s . since then , there has been increasing interest in studying electron systems with strong electron correlations , due to their relevance to a variety of fields , such as the field - effect transistor @ we report on the development of a novel method for the fabrication and characterization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices .<n> the method is based on the application of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) to a periodic array of optical elements , such as tips , couplers , and couplers between neighboring elements . for the first time , we demonstrate the operation of such an amplifier in a 1d geometry , by applying it to a 2d array of coupled optical elements and observing the response of the array to the amplifier s output . <n> optical parametric amplifiers ( opos ) @xcite are one of the most powerful tools for the study of nonlinear phenomena , especially in the presence of nonlinearity . in nonlinear systems ,<n> parametric amplifiers are often used as quantum - mechanical ( qm ) mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometers to probe the nonlinear properties of the system , as well as to determine the fundamental parameters of the nonlinear response . however , in many cases , parametric amplifiers can not be directly used to measure the nonlinear optical response , because the nonlinearity in the system is not captured by the parametric amplifier  we report on the discovery of a new type of gravitational instability , induced by the transverse expansion of a relativistic plasma .<n> the instability is due to the transverse motion of the plasma in the vicinity of a gravitational wave source , and is characterized by the development of an anomalously high amplitude of gravitational waves . in this letter , we report the first results of a systematic search for such an effect in relativistic plasmas , using ultra - low - energy x - ray and gamma - ray observations of relativistic jets from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . <n> the detection of gravitational wave ( gw ) signals from relativistic jets is one of the most exciting and challenging experimental findings of the rhic era @xcite . at the highest energies ,<n> the gw signal is dominated by the gravitational wave background ( grb ) , produced by the interaction between the relativistic jets and the surrounding medium , while at the lowest energies the grb signal is modulated by the inelastic scattering between grb and the medium . as a result , gw signals are observed over a wide range of angular scales , from sub - millisecond to tens of meters , with a we present the results of a study of the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) at redshifts @xmath0 using high - resolution , high - s / n , very large array ( vla ) and very large telescope ( vlt ) data .<n> we focus our study on the collision dynamics of a pair of relativistic , co - eval , ultracompact binaries ( ucb ) , and compare their total luminosities to those of a binary system composed of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with a main - sequence ( ms) star and a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . <n> we find that the collision velocities of the two systems are very similar , with a typical ratio of the hic velocities of 0.65 . however , the total luminosity of the system is significantly lower than that of the ms system , which we attribute to the lower mass of the bsgs , as well as to the presence of a higher mass companion , both of which play an important role in the dynamics of the collision . in the case of the binary system<n> , we find in this work , we study the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 ( rns ) effect in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to the polarization of the cosmic rays emitted by the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .<n> we find that the cmb polarization is strongly dependent on the direction of the observer s polarization . in the direction perpendicular to the observer<n> s direction , the polarization is maximal for the highest energy cmb states . on the other hand , in the orthogonal direction<n> , there is no polarization , except for the lowest energy states , for which the polarization decreases with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy . <n> _ keywords _ : polarization ; cmb radiation we report the discovery of a pair of x -

particle symposium ( ams12 ) at the gran sasso national observatory ( nso ) in italy . in the event of discovery , it will be the first pulsar to be discovered during a sub - millisecond period of its orbit around the galaxy . <n> pulsars are very special objects in that they not only provide unique information about the nature of their host stars , but also allow us to probe the fundamental properties of the universe at very short periods of time . among many pulsars ,<n> the lmc pulsar is of particular interest because it is known to have a very long orbital period ( @xmath0 s ) @xcite  we report on the discovery of a pair of gravitationally bound black holes in a binary system .<n> the black holes are separated by about 10 gravitational radii and the binary system has a common proper motion of the two black holes , which is equal to the orbital period of the system , and the separation is @xmath0 gravitational radii . in the standard model of black hole formation ,<n> the minimum mass of a black hole is set by the mass of the black hole itself , while the maximum mass is given by the ratio of the gravitational redshift of the binary to the binary redshift . <n> the formation of black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is common in both the milky way ( mw ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but the nature of bhs in these galaxies is not well understood . since most bhs form in binary systems , it is reasonable to assume that the bh mass distribution in agn is skewed towards a hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram with a large mass ratio between the bh and its companion , as is often done in the study of gravitational waves ( gws  we present the results of our follow - up timing analysis of the x -

giraffe ( asa - giraffe ) and the atacama large millimetre / sub - millimetre array ( alma ) telescopes . from our analysis ,<n> we conclude that the x - rays are produced by the interaction of the sn ejecta with the dense interstellar medium ( ism ) in the host galaxy , rather than from the interaction with the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , as in the case of the local snr , and that it is most likely due to the interaction between the sn remnant and the dense ism in the local universe . <n> we also present the first detection of a x -ray transient ( xrt ) from the sn 201409",

linear generalization of the usual einstein - maxwell - gauss ( emg ) gauge theory @xcite . among the many applications that have been studied in this context , one of the most fascinating is the possibility of realizing susy in the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssem ) of the theory , for which we now know that it can be realized in the simplest form , namely as the minimal extension of the sgssm . the simplest version of the ms supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been extensively studied in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally .<n> one of the most prominent of these is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , introduced by sakharov in 1983@xcite . in this theory ,<n> the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the electroweak scale . at the same time , supersymmetry breaking is _ not _ invariant under susy - breaking , so that the theory is restricted to one copy . <n> recently , we have shown that this restriction can be relaxed by means of grassmannian ultralocality ( wt ) in the context of the minimal susy sm . here<n> we show how wt can be used to derive the flow equations for susy breaking in this model , and we give explicit results for the case where the cut - off is chosen to be of the same order as the curvature of the theory at the origin , as in the case of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite<n> . then , we present a nonperturbative implementation of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow for a supersymmetric ( susy ) scalar field theory in dimension @xmath0 , restricted to a single copy of spacetime .<n> we show that the rg flow leads to the spontaneous breaking of some ( super)symmetries or identities along the flow , which invalidates the susy property of dimensional reduction . as a result ,<n> the theory is characterized by the breakdown of superrotational invariance , ground -

field ising model ( rfim ) can be described by a minimal truncation that explicitly breaks supersymmetry ( susy ) .<n> the resulting effective field theory ( eft ) has the same long - distance physics as the rfim and is governed by a universal fixed point . near this fixed point<n> , the eft exhibits a rich phenomenology , including the existence of a non - trivial fixed point at which the system undergoes a first - order phase transition to a ferromagnetic phase , and a second - order transition to an antiferromagnetic phase that is controlled by the critical exponents . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.wx , 11.30.rd , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk in recent years , much effort has been devoted to the study of the critical properties of the two -

abelian gauge theory that is completely consistent with the predictions of the standard model in the vacuum and on the physical background of qcd . due to the absence of ultraviolet divergences ,<n> we present a nonperturbative approach to the dynamics of superfluid helium-3 .<n> it is based on a renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the effective average action , which is solved exactly in the limit where the superfluid mass @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse uv scale . in this limit<n> , the rg equation reduces to the well - known schwinger - dyson equation ( wt ) for the one - loop superfluid density of states , and the wt relation is recovered . <n> the present approach provides a unified framework for the study of the flow of a superfluid in the presence of an external magnetic field , as in the problem of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with a quantized magnetic field in an anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometry , for example in a superconductor , or in a fluid with dynamical viscosity , such as in a liquid helium-3 ( qed ) system . for a 3d system ,<n> the flow is governed by a pair of rg equations , one of which ( eq . ( [ eq_wt_susy_ we present a superfield formalism for the flow of a random field in dimension @xmath0 .<n> the flow equations are proven to be valid at zero temperature and zero auxiliary temperature , and to reduce to the flow equation for the random field on a finite  larkin '' scale in the limit of large dimension . <n> random fields are ubiquitous in physics and engineering . in particular , they play a central role in random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , quantum field theory ( qft ) , as well as in the foundations of statistical mechanics , such as the lagrangian , the poincar - birkhoff - strauss ( pbs ) equation , or the ricci - schwinger ( ssw ) equations . despite their ubiquity , however , random fields do not play a trivial role in many practical applications . for example , it is well known that the hamiltonian of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can not be decomposed into a supersymmetric ( susy ) part and an antisymmetric part , even though susy is manifest in the bec itself@xcite we present a superfield formalism for the description of the critical behavior of the random field ising model ( rfim ) in the presence of a cusp .<n> the formalism is based on a set of coupled frg equations with appropriate boundary conditions , and it allows us to address the long -

einstein condensation ( bec ) , high - temperature superconductors , superfluid helium-3 , or phase transitions . to this end , in recent years , a large number of papers have been devoted to the analysis of nonlinear interactions close to fixed points of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , either with or without a gradient term in the action . for instance , the we consider the critical behavior of a critical ising spin system in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we use a renormalization -

known examples of singularities on surfaces such as the riemann surfaces @x , spheroids @x<n> , or ( more generally ) surfaces of general type , such as slacs , cat(0 ) covers , macdonald covers and so on . for instance , kollr and shepherd - barron classified all singularities over the base of a slp ( or macdonald ) or a pec ( or pec ) surface . as far as we know , no other surface has been classified by so many different methods , even though there are many examples of such singular we classify all slc surface singularities over @xmath0 . in the normal case we work in the notations of kollr and shepherd - barron , while in the non - normal case they used the notation in @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction .<n> _ the _ singularities _ of a surface are the divisors that appear in the inverse image of the double curve of that surface . for a smooth surface ,<n> a _ surface singularity _ is a point - like singularity , such as the boundary of a cylinder , the edge of a plate , or the surface of a plane , that belongs to the intersection of two curves in the plane . on the other hand , for a singular surface<n> , it is possible to define an _ a priori _ probability measure on the surface such that the sum of the probabilities of the individual singularities is equal to the probability of the total surface singularity , i.e. , one is  close '' to the total , and the  far '' from the total is zero . a surface singularity is _ not _ we compute the minimal semiresolution and the normalization along the exceptional curve of the blow up of @xmath0 . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the normalization of a divisor is the sum of the divisors that appear in the inverse of that divisor . in this paper<n> , we consider divisor normalizations on surfaces , that is , normalizations of double curves .<n> such normalizations are often used in the study of blow ups of surfaces ; for instance , in the construction of the riemann zeta function of a surface @xcite , and in the proof of the bifurcation theorem of bernoulli and shapiro @x<n> . however , these normalizations do not always correspond to the semiresolutions of the surface . as a consequence ,<n> the semi resolution of a blow up is not the same as the minimal resolution of the same blow up , even if the normalized divisor has the same singularities ( e.g. , it has points of different types ) . here<n> we consider the case in which the normalizations correspond to semismooth surfaces . for this purpose , <n> we first compute we compute the minimal semiresolution of a blow up of a curve in the complex plane . <n> let @xmath0 be a complete intersection .<n> then there is a natural restricted cover @xxmath1 , which is defined by pulling back the normal derivative at the point of the complete intersection and normalizing along the exceptional curve . in this paper<n> , we study the blow ups of curves in the plane and compute the semiresolutions of the corresponding restricted covers . the case of a point @xcite was the first , and still is the case today , for which we have a large collection of examples of restricted covers of the plane , with a variety of interesting properties . for example , there is an infinite collection of covers that are complete intersections , so there are a large class of examples , even more than the collection of complete intersections of the real line , where there are many interesting examples . as a corollary ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that the minimal resolution of a restricted cover is equal to its inverse image , that is , the inverse of its strict transform . here<n> we present a new result for the case where the point @ we give a complete characterization of the minimal semiresolution of the blow up @xmath0 in the gorenstein model .<n> in particular , we show that there are no degenerate cusps or branch lines in this model , and that the minimal resolution is equal to the number of disjoint copies of the double curve of the first blow up . <n> the model @xcite is the simplest in the sense that no two blow ups of the same model can be distinguished by their minimal resolution . in this paper<n> we present a complete classification of minimal resolutions of the three blow up models . for each of these models<n> , there is a minimal resolution of the second blow up whose inverse image is a smooth rational curve that intersects transversely precisely at one point of the other two . as a corollary<n> we obtain a complete description of the singularities that appear in the inverse images of these minimal resolutions . here<n> we deal with the case in which the double curves of the models are d.c . let @xmath0 be a smooth base .<n> we study the singularities of the exceptional divisor in the base and the semiresolutions of the base , and show that they are determined by the jacobian of the branch data . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite , where we studied the base singularities . in particular , we are interested in the case where the base is reducible , i.e. , the base has no singularities in the first row and column of the preimage of the boundary divisor . here<n> we show that the base singularity problem is reduced to the study of the singularity of a certain divisor which is the  jacobi polynomial '' of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . as a corollary<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that the gauss hypergeometric function @x<n> 1$ ] is isomorphic to the _ s_-matrix of the symplectic map @x 2  $ ] , which is a generalization of the well -

gluon plasma formed in high - energy collisions . a detailed description of the lattice boltzmann model ( lbt ) that has been developed over the last few years and improvements to the early versions that have been used for the study of jet transport and medium modifications in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is given .<n> the model is used to study elastic energy loss through multiple scattering , propagation of jet - induced medium excitations , and their contributions to parton distribution and jet profiles of reconstructed jets using the anti-@xmath0 algorithm in fastjet . in particular , the energy and time or length dependence in a static and uniform qgp medium is investigated . a diffusion wake generated behind a propagating parton<n> effectively modifies the underlying fluid background and therefore affects jet reconstruction . these effects can all be studied within the lbt model and are important for understanding the medium modified jet cross section and jet profile . since interaction in pqcd between an energetic parton and the thermal medium is dominated by small - angle scatterings and therefore a large fraction of thermal recoil partons from jet - medium interaction fall within the jet cone and therefore should become a part of the reconstructed jet , their contribution to the jet energy profile and parton distributions is studied . finally , contributions using the linear boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model for hard parton scattering in a quark -

gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium has been an important topic in qcd physics since the early days of qcd @xcite . since qcd is a strongly interacting theory ,<n> parton interactions in a qgp medium must be treated in a non - perturbative way . to treat parton interaction in a medium with finite baryon chemical potential , which is a typical situation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , it is necessary to develop a formalism that can describe parton transport in a thermal medium , as well as parton rescatterings in the high - energy limit @xmath0 . here<n> we present a model for the parton we study the parton scattering in a static and uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we show that the total scattering rate in a uniform qgp medium increases linearly with the temperature while that for a static medium increases quadratically . as a consequence ,<n> the angular distribution of the final parton in a @math1 scattering has a universal form @xcite . in the presence of a qcd phase transition , however , the final state partons are no longer localized to the ground state of the medium but diffuse out to infinity , a phenomenon that has been observed in lattice qcd simulations . <n> the scattering of thermal partons in a thermal qgp ( tqgp , hereafter referred to as qgp \" ) has been studied extensively in the literature , both in simulations and experiments . at fixed parton energies , qgp interactions are described by the relativistic boltzmann equation ( rbe ) , which in turn is derived from the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equation . for fixed values of the incident parton energy and the qgp phase transition temperature we study the energy spectra of outgoing partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we show that the parton - medium interaction leads to the appearance of a new energy spectrum of the outgoing gluon which is characterized by an exponential fall - off with a slope given by the temperature . <n> the energy distribution of the final parton in a qgp medium is very sensitive to the initial energy of the incoming parton , since the outgoing parton carries most of the incident energy . as a result<n> , the energy distributions of the produced partons can be very different from those of the unscattered partons . in this paper<n> we study parton interactions in a thermal qgp at finite temperatures @xcite . the interaction between a parton and the medium is described by an effective lagrangian in which the interaction term is proportional to the temperature and the partonic degrees of freedom are described in terms of the medium - modified hamiltonian . at temperatures below the deconfinement transition ,<n> the interactions between partons are dominated by gluon - quark scattering . above the transition<n> the interaction terms between gluons and quarks we discuss jet - induced medium excitation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions due to multiple parton scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we show that the energy of the thermal recoil parton in the small -

relativistic regime , where the energy density of the medium is much higher than the thermal energy density @xmath0 , the process is known as hard thermal parton ( htp ) scattering . however , in the relativistic regime where the temperature is much lower , or qgp is expected to be isotropically -

parton scattering .<n> the final parton spectra and energy - momentum density of the jet - induced medium excitation are studied in monte carlo simulations . <n> the transverse - momentum distribution and elastic energy loss of an energetic parton propagating in a qgp medium are studied . to take into account the back - reaction in the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> the parton is allowed to transport further according to the transport equation and to undergo additional scatterings in the subsequent time intervals . using the small - angle approximation of @xmath0 scattering , we estimate the averaged transverse momentum squared per unit length and the elastic energy lost during the propagation of an initial parton in a static qgp and compare it with the experimental data from hera . at hera<n> , the energy loss and the average transverse momentum broadening of a leading part leading parton transport in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature is studied within the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> we show that the energy dependence of the energy loss in a single parton - parton scattering is larger than that from multiple scatterings over a long distance , especially for more energetic quarks at lower temperatures . in a uniform qgp at a temperature @xmath0 mev , we find that the elastic energy loss per unit mean - free - path increases with the energy of the initial parton . at higher temperatures , however , the results from lbt simulations are in good agreement with those from perturbative qcd calculations . <n> the study of the thermal evolution of partons in a hot and dense qcd medium has been a long - standing goal of high - energy physics research @xcite . during the last decade<n> , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the development of the lbt model , which is a lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) inspired transport approach , and has been successfully applied to a large variety of problems in high energy physics , such as heavy - ion collisions we study the energy loss of gluons and quarks in a hot qcd medium using a lattice - based perturbative qcd ( lbt ) model .<n> we investigate the propagation of a gluon and a quark in a uniform and static medium with a temperature @xmath0 , and compute the averaged elastic energy loss per mean free path along the propagation path for different initial parton energies and medium temperatures . <n> qcd is a theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with strong interactions between quarks and gluons . in qcd<n> , the interaction energy between a parton and the thermal parton is proportional to the energy of the parton . as a result , in a thermal medium , partons lose their energy by scattering off thermal partons , which in turn lose energy by interacting with the medium . at high temperatures ,<n> parton - parton scatterings are strongly modified by the presence of the medium and the energy dependence of parton energy loss can be described by a small - angle approximation ( sa ) @xcite . however , at low temperatures and/or high energies , energy and momentum are conserved during each scattering , leading to parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is simulated within the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> parton energy loss is calculated by including the energy and momentum lost by the propagating parton due to multiple scattering in the qgp medium . in the lbt model ,<n> energy is conserved in each parton - medium scattering and the energy spectrum of the parton propagating in the medium is shown to consist of thermal recoil partons plus jet - induced medium partons which are carried by the leading parton . to study jet transport and medium excitations at the same time , both of the outgoing partons in each @xmath0-channel scattering<n> , we also calculate the energy spectra of the leading and thermal recoil partson , as well as the energy distribution of leading partons minus negative \" partons at different times in the propagation of partons . <n> partons propagating in a hot and dense qcd medium are expected to lose a significant fraction of their energy in the process of propagation @xcite . as a result , partons should deposit significant amount of energy into the medium , which can be detected experimentally in high - energy heavy -  we study the propagation of jet - induced medium partons in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium using the longitudinal boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model .<n> the energy and momentum lost to the qgp medium by the propagating parton will act like a source for the excitation of the medium parton through the propagation and transport of the jet - inducing medium partions . in the lbt model ,<n> the leading parton from each @xmath0 scattering is also allowed to further propagate and interact with the medium through the back - reaction in the transport equation . as a result<n> , we find that the energy density distributions of the excitations induced by a propagating gluon are similar to those of a propagating medium gluon with a longitudinal momentum fraction of the order of the initial one . <n> we also study the reconstruction of the parton spectrum from the energy loss and the medium excitations . for a given initial parton momentum fraction , the reconstructed parton spectra are almost independent of the incident parton s energy . however , if the initial energy fraction is larger than a threshold value , there is a significant difference between the reconstructed spectra and the unreconstructed ones we study jet - induced medium parton interactions in heavy ion collisions using a linear response theory ( lbt ) model and monte carlo simulations . we show that energy density distributions of medium recoil and negative \" partons are sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton during its propagation in a qgp medium .<n> we also show that the energy density distribution of the medium partons depends on the angle between the propagation direction of the parton and the medium temperature . <n> the interaction of hard partons with a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is one of the most important processes in high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments . in these collisions ,<n> partons produced in the initial hard interaction interact with the medium at a high energy density , lose energy and momentum via parton - medium interaction , and produce partons in the final state @xcite . as a result , a parton with an initial energy @xmath0 gev<n> will propagate in a uniform medium of hadrons with a temperature of a few gev and a baryon number density of 10@xmath1 at a mean temperature of 2 mev . at the final stage in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , partons produced in the gluon - gluon fusion reaction lose a significant fraction of their energy to the subsequent propagation of a parton in the hot and dense medium created by the collision .<n> we study the angular distribution of such partons and their dependence on the initial energy of the propagating parton , the temperature of the medium , and the transverse momentum of the leading parton within the large hadron collider ( lbt ) monte carlo framework . using a modified version of the fastjet code with the anti-@xmath0 algorithm for jet reconstruction , we find that the angular distributions of the partons have azimuthal anisotropy that depends on the temperature and the initial parton energy , but not on the transverse momenta of the jet - induced medium partons . <n> the energy loss of partons in the initial stages of the collision plays an important role in understanding the mechanism of parton production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . during the early stage ,<n> partons created in the collision lose a substantial fraction ( @xmath1 ) of their initial energy to propagation in a hot , we study the propagation of a fast parton in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) by including parton hadronization effects and large - angle scatterings of jet - induced medium partons in the leading parton model ( lbt ) .<n> we find that the energy loss of the propagating parton due to the interaction with the qgp medium leads to significant broadening of the final hadronic jets and a significant reduction of their spectra , compared to a reconstructed jet with the same energy but without medium parton interaction . <n> the study of jet spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe the properties of qcd matter at temperatures and baryon densities inaccessible to hadron colliders ( hics ) such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron electron ( lhc ) @xcite . in these collisions ,<n> the rapidity and azimuthal angle distributions of the produced hadrons are known to be well described by the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , which has been well tested experimentally at rhic energies . however , in order to understand the leading partons propagating through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium lose a significant amount of energy during their propagation through the medium . during propagation ,<n> the energetic leading parton experiences transverse momentum broadening due to interaction with medium partons .<n> the energy of the energetic parton is subtracted from both the parton distribution function and the total jet energy during the propagation . as a result , reconstructed jets contain both energetic and medium parton - induced partons inside the jet cone , but with a net transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . <n> the propagation of energetic partons through a hot and dense qgp medium has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in this study , we focus on the jet propagation and its evolution with time in a uniform medium at a constant temperature @xmath0 mev . due to the finite jet - cone size , medium partonic scatterings and diffusion<n> are expected to lead to a reduction of the jet energy and transverse momentum , as well as an enhancement of the soft parton distributions . however , the energy loss and the composition of reconstructed jets are found to be sensitive to the medium - parton interaction  the evolution of a high energy parton propagating through a qgp medium is studied at different times in terms of the momentum fraction of the reconstructed jet energy .<n> the initial parton energy is varied from 100 gev to 1000 gev in a uniform medium at a temperature @xmath0 mev , and it propagates through the medium with a modified fragmentation function . at later times , the leading parton loses energy to the medium , which is carried away by thermal recoil partons . as a result ,<n> the transverse profile of reconstructed jets is broadened and the width of the jet cone is reduced . <n> the study of parton propagation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe the properties of qcd matter under extreme conditions , such as the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , created in the collision @xcite . in particular , one of the most important aspects of the qgp is the formation of a deconfined phase of matter , called the qcd phase diagram , where the initial temperature and the chemical composition of the medium are expected to be of the order of the critical temperatures of the hot and dense qgp matter @x the leading parton transport ( lbt ) model describes the propagation of a high energy parton in a quark -

dimensional theory of quarks and antiquarks in a strong magnetic field has a low energy effective lagrangian which is chirally invariant and respects ( 1 + 1)-dimensional chiral symmetry but is otherwise unspecified . as a result , there is no mass gap and there are no infrared fixed points . however ,<n> if the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory is lower than the lowest mass gap , then there is a procedure by which one can obtain a nontrivial effective theory of the four - fermion fields by integrating out all of the massive modes of the fields . we consider a chiral gauge theory for fermions with a mass gap of about @xmath0 .<n> the effective action contains a mass term for the lightest fermion which is proportional to the square of the mass gap , but is otherwise identical to that of the standard chiral lagrangian . using a renormalization group procedure ,<n> we show that this effective action has no ultraviolet divergences and that there are no infrared divergences , so that it can be used to compute the spectrum of long wavelength excitations . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.rd , 11.15.tk , 11.10.lm , 12.60.jv there is a growing interest in the possibility of the existence of extra dimensions . in this letter<n> , we investigate the possibility that these extra dimensions could manifest themselves in the form of a gauge theory with fermionic zero modes . to this end , in the context of gauge theories with a chiral symmetry @xcite , it is natural to restrict ourselves to a theory which has only the lowest landau level , i.e. the one with the lowest fermi energy . for this reason , the study of such a theory has been a we consider the gross - neveu model in @xmath0 spatial dimensions .<n> we show that there are no infrared stable fixed points for the renormalization group flow of the relevant couplings , in contrast to what is known for scalar field theories . on the other hand ,<n> we find that there is a non - trivial infrared fixed point for couplings with close to maximal symmetry . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.pb , 11.10.wx , 11.15.tk , 12.20.ds it has been known for a long time that the gross <n> neveus model @xcite is characterized by the presence of an infinite number of massless dirac fermions in its spectrum . in this model<n> , the fermionic degrees of freedom can be described by an effective action with a quadratic term and a quartic term , which are responsible for the generation of the mass of the dirac particles , as well as their yukawa couplings to fermion fields . as such , this model is closely related to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , first studied in ref.@xcite , where it is found that we show that the @xmath0-@xmath1 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in a wide class of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional models with a short range interaction , such as the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .<n> we find that the infrared dynamics is governed by the lowest landau level ( lll ) modes , and the fermion mass is generated in the most symmetric case . <n> _ introduction _ the study of chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) has a long history , going back to the pioneering works of bekenstein and hawking @xcite . in recent years<n> , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the problem of breaking chiral symmetry in qcd , using various methods such as renormalization group ( rg ) , perturbation theory and chiral effective action ( cak ) @x<n> . however , there is no general agreement as to which of these methods is more appropriate for the problem at hand . at present , it is widely accepted that the simplest way to break the symmetry is to introduce an interaction . for example , in chiral perturbation theory ( cpt ) the we show that the effective low - energy dynamics of chirally symmetric models with a short range interaction in a background magnetic field is described by a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu like model with an infinite number of flavors .<n> we establish that different flavors come out as the representation space of the magnetic translations in the original ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional model . in this paper<n> we present a new approach to the problem of the physical landau pole ( plp ) . <n> plp is one of the most fundamental problems in statistical mechanics , and it has been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental effort in recent years @xcite . as a paradigmatic example of the plp<n> , we consider the @xmath0 nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , which has been shown to exhibit a plp in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . here<n> we provide a new derivation of the njl model and show that it is equivalent to an effective gross - neuveu model with a finite number of dimensions . using this derivation ,<n> we demonstrate that the generation of fermion mass in the lower half - plane of the coupling space we consider a two - dimensional chiral gross - neveu like model in the presence of a background magnetic field perpendicular to the field .<n> the model has an infinite number of conserved charges . at the level of the effective theory<n> , we calculated the two - loop @xmath0 function and analyzed the renormalization group flow in the subspace of the couplings . in the half - plane of couplings where the infrared dynamics is weakly coupled , there is generation of the fermion mass . this mass generation pattern is consistent with the earlier suggested conjecture of the universality of the so - called magnetic catalysis @xcite in the models from the same universality class as the chiral nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model . <n> recently , it has been suggested that the chiral njl model and the three - dimensional ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ( 2d ) gross - nambu like model are the same quantum many - body system , with the same chirality and fermionic excitation spectrum , but with a different set of conserved charge ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) . to support this conjecture ,<n> we we propose a model of interacting spinless fermions in two spatial dimensions .<n> it is based on the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) action with the coupling @xmath0 , where the coupling constants are allowed to take arbitrary values . in this model ,<n> the effective action is a superposition of the hamiltonian of the njl action and the lieb - liniger action , which describes the infrared dynamics of the lowest landau level modes . using the supersymmetry technique , we show that the structure of the effective supersymmetry breaking action is determined by the symmetry under magnetic translations of the original ( 3 + 1)-dimensional theory . as a result<n> , the effective theory has a flavor symmetry , in which the states of different flavors correspond to different eigenstates of the same operator . <n> the physics of interacting quantum particles is one of the most active areas in modern condensed matter physics @xcite . among various proposals for the realization of interacting many - body systems , _<n> e.g. _ , spin chains in optical lattices , ultracold atomic gases , and quantum dots , there is a growing interest in we show that the four - fermion interaction @xmath0 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) acquires a non - trivial chiral four - index contribution .<n> this contribution , which is induced by the vacuum polarization of fermions , can be interpreted as a four - loop contribution to the one - loop effective action . in this paper<n> , we investigate the chiral properties of the minimal su(@xmath1 ) supersymmetric sm in four dimensions . to this end ,<n> we introduce an effective theory of massless , non - abelian , massless fermionic fields in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space - time and study its properties . <n> the chiral phase transition ( cpt ) is one of the most important open problems in physics , and is expected to play a major role in the structure of the universe . at the same time , it is believed to be intimately connected with the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the high - energy limit , where the supersymmetry ( susy ) of the sm is to be broken @xcite . for the description of the qgp we calculate the one - loop electroweak correction to the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we find that it is of the order of @xmath0 , where the first error is statistical and the second one is due to the infrared divergences in the propagators of the massless fermions . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the electroweak vacuum , or cavity , is one of the most important topics in low - energy effective field theory . in the standard model ,<n> the vacuum is described by the electrodynamics with three massless quarks , and the vacuum fluctuations are given by the  wilson loops '' @xcite . at low energies , however , electroweak corrections are non - perturbative in nature and can be calculated only at two - loop order . as a result , it is well known that the vacuum can be well approximated by a simple electroweak hamiltonian , the so - called minimal supergravity ( msp ) model . the msp model has been extensively studied in the literature , especially in connection with the vacuum properties of the m in this work , we present a new method for the determination of the lorentz factor @xmath0 of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .<n> this method is based on the use of a non - uniform grid of coupled integral equations , which are solved iteratively . in this method ,<n> the equations are solved step by step , one at a time , and the results are compared to the experimental data . <n> we have applied this method to calculate the radiative lifetimes of relativistic heavy ions of ionzekr , er , xe , rhic and sr at energies ranging from 100 to 1000 mev . for the case of er and xe ions , our results are in good agreement with the experimental values , while for the other three ions we find a significant deviation from the experimental results . using this technique , it is possible to determine the _ dynamic _ <n> _ energy loss rate of these ions and to show that it is consistent with the theoretical values for a wide range of energies . +<n> pacs numbers : : 41.60.-m , 41.75.ht , 42. we consider the dynamics of a quantum particle coupled to a classical field in one spatial dimension .<n> we focus on the coupling between the classical and quantum degrees of freedom in the limit of weak coupling . in this limit<n> , we derive an analytical expression for the steady -

smirnov ( ks ) parameter @xmath0 , which is a measure of the deviation of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) from a gaussian distribution .<n> this method is based on the use of a monte - carlo , real - time , all - optical parametric wavelet transform . in this method ,<n> the time evolution of the fourier transform of the vacf is directly obtained from the wavelet , rather than from the parametric . as a result , the monte carlo wavelet method can be applied to a wide range of wavelet amplitudes , including those which do not satisfy the gauss -

einstein condensate ( bec ) . for this purpose , the classical bec<n> is usually treated as a homogeneous system of fermions , which are confined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hilbert space . on the other hand , for a system of bosons , e.g. a fermion condensate ( fcc ) we present high angular resolution observations of the relativistic outflow from the supernova remnant sn1987a ( sgr a * ) .<n> the data were taken with the wide field optical polarimeter ( wfom ) at las campanas observatory ( lco ) in northern chile . <n> this is the first ever high resolution polarimetric observation of a supernova remnant ( snr ) and the only one taken in the presence of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath0 g ) @xcite . in this paper<n> , we present the results of our observations of a relativistically expanding shell of material ( rsos ) ejected in the explosion of the snr ( sn 1987a ) which is moving with the velocity of light ( v@xmath1 km / s ) towards the observer . during the course of the explosion , the shell undergoes several rapid changes in morphology , size , and velocity , resulting in the ejection of a large amount of material . at the end of the shell s lifetime ,<n> the mass of the ejecta is determined to be @x , with the bulk of the material being ejected at v@ xmath2 , while the we present a model for the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy -

called pentropy inequality , which states that , for a given configuration of agents in a markov chain , the log - sobolev constant of the associated process is bounded from below by a constant which depends on the configuration and the speed of the averaging process . the proof of this inequality requires a number of technical tools , including the theory of reversible chains @x we consider the opinion dynamics of a finite number of agents @xmath0 , each of which has a different opinion @xcite , interacting via a random interaction with their neighbors .<n> this model has been studied extensively , both in the finite and infinite lattice settings . in the infinite lattice case<n> , it has been shown that the dynamics of this model are completely determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of the system . for the finite - agent case ,<n> however , no complete description of the dynamics has been given . <n> the purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of a general opinion dynamics for a finite set of agents , and to give a complete characterization of all possible forms of interactions between the agents . we study the consensus time for opinion formation in a finite - agent model of opinion dynamics . in this model ,<n> opinions are formed by a group of agents , each of them having a different opinion about an issue .<n> the process evolves in time and is subject to the constraint that the opinions of all agents must be the same . <n> we prove that consensus is reached in time @xmath0 , which is polynomial in the size of the group . as a corollary<n> , we obtain a polynomial - time upper bound on the number of opinions needed to form a majority opinion in the process . for the special case where the opinions are  ordered '' ( i.e. , all the agents have the same opinion ) , the upper bound coincides with the kolmogorov - smirnov time . finally , for the general case where opinions are not ordered , as well as for some special cases of the two - opinion model ( for example , where all agents have equal opinions ) we prove the existence of exponential consensus times . the idea that opinion formation can be described by dynamical systems has been around for more than a century @xcite , starting with the work we propose a new stochastic model of the discrete logarithm of the number of agents in a multi - agent system .<n> the model is based on the concept of the _ tokenization process _ : initially each agent has a collection ( cluster ) of tokens . at time @xmath0 each agent gives his tokens to the other agents . <n> tokenization is a stochastic process in which agents interact by exchanging their tokens with the help of a distributed random number generator . in the case of multi - agents systems ,<n> this number generator is a random variable , which can be expressed in the form of a markov chain , a gaussian , or a poisson process , depending on the characteristics of the token distribution . as an example<n> , we consider the case where agents interact with each other only through the exchange of their tokens , i.e. , the so - called _ discrete logarithm _ ( d@xmath1 ) . for this model<n> we derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of the total number of tokens exchanged between two agents , for arbitrary initial conditions , and show that the distribution depends on the underlying dynamics of the system only through we consider the motion of a binary mixture of markov chains in two dimensions .<n> the markov chain particles move at half -

cluster separation . we find that the coalesced state is characterized by a power - law distribution of cluster separations , with exponents that depend on the binary mixture parameters , such as the ratio of rates of change of initial configuration to final configuration , as well as the particle number . <n> * keywords : * binary mixture , markov process , coalescence , clustering * pacs :* 05.40.-a , 05.45.-a in this note , i give a short survey of recent work on the finite voter model .<n> i also discuss some open problems . <n> the voter model @xcite is a simple model of a population of individuals , of which there are @xmath0 choices at each point in time , and each chooses one of these two choices at a time . in this model ,<n> the individual s actions ( opinions ) influence the outcome of the election , which is decided by the combined action of the population at each time instant . for a complete graph @xxmath1 of individuals<n> , there is a markov chain of states that evolves as the population evolves , with rates that scale with the number of individuals in the chain . at each instant , each individual decides one of its two opinions by making a decision in the direction of the other s opinion . the mean hitting time to a state<n> is called the _ coalescence time _ of the markov chains , defined here as the time until the entire chain of chains coalesces to form a single particle . from the perspective of statistical physics , this is the simplest non - trivial example of a non - equilibrium process we consider the voter model and a variant of it , the so - called fmie voter model , in which two specified agents are randomly assigned different opinions , initially .<n> we show that the mean meeting time between the specified agents is asymptotically @xmath0 times the mean time between two arbitrary agents , on a complete graph @xcite . in the fmie model<n> , this means that the meeting time can be computed from the speed of the associated markov chain ( mc ) . <n> we also consider the variant in which only two agents are specified , and show that there is an upper bound on the mean meetings time of these two agents . as a byproduct of the analysis ,<n> we obtain a lower bound for the spectral gap of the mc associated with the voter process , which is of the correct order of magnitude . *<n> introduction : * in a classic paper by cox , he showed that the distribution of the time it takes for an agent to change his opinion ( the  voter model '' ) is _ not _ asymptotically gaussian , but it has a _ bottleneck _ behavior , namely , if two agents change their opinion we prove that the mean meeting time of @xmath0 independent identically distributed (  fmie '' ) walkers on the two - dimensional torus is asymptotically larger than the mean time for the corresponding standard random walk on the torus to meet . <n> the result applies to the finite voter model @xcite , and also to a variety of special geometries .<n> the proof is elementary , in the sense that it does not rely on theorem [ t_oliveira ] , which would have given the same bound for all regular graphs . as a corollary of the result ,<n> we show that the number of fmie walkers meeting in the same place at the same time is bounded above by the number ( in units of the diameter ) of neighbors at which the meeting time has been reached in the previous interval ; this number depends on the geometry , but is of order unity for regular graphs and of order one for infinite - dimensional lattices . in a series of recent papers , we have studied fmie models on various finite geometries , including the toroidal lattice , the cylinder , a cone on the half - line , as well as the fano plane @x we consider a model of self - avoiding walks on a random graph , with the property that the number of walkers on the graph at time @xmath0 is a random variable depending only on the positions of the walkers .<n> the model is a generalization of the well - known voter model @xcite , where walkers are assumed to obey the same voting rules . in the limit of large distances between walkers , the model exhibits epidemic - like behavior . <n> _ keywords _ : epidemics , random graphs , fpp models , non -

energy . for the angular averaged interaction parameters , we use the legendre polynomial expansions of the effective interaction , and find that these parameters are color- and spin - independent . as a consequence , for each flavor , each of the chemical potential and the average effective mass can be obtained from the interaction parameters in the same way as in the balanced case . <n> the physics behind the formation of quark -

flavor imbalanced quark ( @xmath1 ) system , the effective masses are obtained both analytically within the weak - coupling limit , and numerically within the rpa approximation . we find that , in contrast to the strong - coupling result , where the two effective masses of each flavor are independent of each other due to the lack of an inter - flavor interaction , they depend on the chemical potentials of both flavors , which is a consequence of the static screening of the electric gluons at long wavelength . <n> the thermodynamics of quark matter at low temperature is determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of qcd @xcite . in the limit of an infinite number of colors ( quarks ) ,<n> the eos reduces to that of an ideal gas , @x we compute the qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat in the large-@xmath0 limit at zero temperature using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .<n> we find that the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat and effective mass signals a breakdown of fermi -

zero @xmath0 .<n> it is shown that the value of the magnetic moment is determined by the euclidean action of the statistical theory , and that this value can be expressed in terms of the gauss - bonnet function of the theory . in particular , it is found that the contribution of this function to the effective potential , which is proportional to the energy density of the system , is of the same order of magnitude as the one of the effective nucleon - nucleon potential . <n> the anomalous magnetization of the electron is of fundamental importance in nuclear physics , as it is the only known quantity that quantifies the strength of the interaction between the electron and the neutron . for neutrons ,<n> the electron s magnetization is of order unity , while for protons it is of about one - half of that of electrons . as a consequence<n> , the electron has a magnetic moment much larger than the proton s and the electron - proton interaction is the dominant one in the neutron - proton system . since the electron magnetization has a the connection between quantum field theory ( qft ) at finite temperature and statistical mechanics at finite density is discussed .<n> it is shown that the partition function of qft can be expressed in terms of the euclidean action , the chemical potential and the temperature of the system . in the case of statistical mechanics<n> the connection is made using the schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) , which is solved numerically . <n> the qft partition function @xcite has become a standard tool in the study of finite temperature field theories , as well as in applications such as statistical mechanics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments , where it plays an important role in the calculation of cross sections , correlation functions and transport coefficients . at zero temperature ,<n> all particles are bosons , and the only interaction between them is the gluon field , whose equation of state ( eos ) is given by @xmath0 , with the temperature and chemical potential being the only free parameters . as a consequence , all correlation functions , from the eos to the rhic one , are given by the we present a derivation of the rpa corrections to the thermodynamic potential and to fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequencies in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .<n> the derivation is based on a set of contour integrals , which can be expanded in terms of the real and imaginary parts . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.90.+b , 14.80.bn in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics the higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . in its minimal extension ( mssm ) ,<n> it contains only fermions , bosons and their corresponding composites , known as supersymmetric particles ( ssps ) @xcite . for a description of the sm particles one has to take into account the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , in which case the susy particle content has to be encoded in the superpartners of the particles . however , this supersymmetry breaking can not be implemented in the sm without introducing fermion fields , called quarks , into the theory . the most well - known fermi - higgs coupling is @xmath we present a generalization of the perturbative qcd polarization tensor to non - zero quark chemical potentials .<n> this is achieved by performing the matsubara sum on the polarization tensor , which is shown to be equivalent to a contour integral over the chemical potential . as an example<n> , we consider the case of a chemical potential @xmath0 , where we find that , in the imbalanced case , the gluon self - energy is proportional to the square of the chemicalpotential . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.fe , 14.40.aq , 14.65.ha the polarization of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) consists of a plasma of quarks and gluons confined to a small volume @xcite . in the presence of gluons ,<n> the plasma undergoes a phase transition to a state with a large number of quark particles ( qpcs ) , called the qgp phase . at the same time , anti - quarks ( aqps ) are present in the plasma and form a small fraction of the total number of particles , i.e. , a qgp we study the effect of the finite size of the system on the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .<n> we find that the qpt can be either continuous or discontinuous , depending on the value of the coupling constant @xmath0 . in the continuous case ,<n> we show that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition , which is characterized by a change in the critical exponents of the order parameter . for discontinuous transitions<n> , we find a second - order transition characterized by the vanishing of the ratio of the transition temperature to the critical temperature . <n> the study of quantum phase transitions is one of the most important topics in modern condensed matter physics . during the last decade , a great deal of work has been done to understand the properties of strongly interacting systems , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic)@xcite and the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of ultrarelativistic atomic nuclei @x<n> . one important aspect of these studies is the question of the nature of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) in the presence of strong interactions , where the the renormalized gluon self - energy is calculated in the high - density limit for the case of massless quarks .<n> it is shown that in this limit the gluon propagator is proportional to the square of the quark mass , @xmath0 , and to the squared quark - antiquark mass squared , _<n> i.e. _ , the qcd coupling constant . as a consequence ,<n> the strong - coupling constant of qcd is determined by the gluonic vacuum . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.fe , 14.40.aq the strong coupling constant @xcite is a fundamental constant in qcd , which describes the strength of the interaction between a quark and a gluon . in the standard model ( sm )<n> the quarks and gluons are the only degrees of freedom . however , in quantum field theory ( qft ) the gluons and quarks are not free particles , since the qft is a non - perturbative theory . due to this fact<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in the possibility to extend the sm we study the effect of the presence of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) in the framework of the non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) .<n> we find that the eos is modified due to the condensate and that this leads to an increase of the effective number of particles with respect to the bare quark - antiquark pair . as a result ,<n> the nuclear eos becomes stiffer and the suppression of the anomalous magnetic moment of the neutron becomes more pronounced . <n> the study of the nuclear properties of matter has a long history , being one of the main topics in nuclear physics @xcite . in the early days of the theory of quantum mechanics<n> , the bec was proposed as a possible explanation for the origin of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) and heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments . during the last decade , hic experiments have been used to measure the properties of the dense matter created in relativistic rhic and hic collisions , such as density , temperature , chemical potential , and we study the thermodynamic properties of a system of fermions ( gluons and quarks ) immersed in a background medium of non - interacting quarks and gluons .<n> we show that the system can be described in terms of a fermi gas and a chemical potential , respectively , which are functions of the temperature , the chemical potential and the mass of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium . in the limit of vanishing quark chemical potential<n> the system is equivalent to a gas of bosons . for large temperatures and/or large masses of quarks ( @xmath0 ) ,<n> the qgp is expected to undergo a phase transition to a qcd - like deconfined state . <n> one of the most important problems in the theory of strongly interacting quantum systems is the question of the stability of the system with respect to small fluctuations of the degrees of freedom . on the other hand , it is also of great interest to understand the structure of the qcd phase diagram ( pd ) in the region of low temperatures and small baryon densities @xcite . at the same time , one is also interested in understanding how the properties of qcd ideal bose gases are considered in the lorentz and coulomb gauges .<n> it is shown that the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and the ideal fermi gas ( ffg ) vanish in the limit @xmath0 . in this limit<n> the bec of the ideal gas is proportional to the square root of the number of particles , while that of the non - ideal gas has a power - law dependence on the density . <n> pacs number(s ) : 11.10.wx , 11.15.bt , 12.20.ds in this paper , we consider the possibility of the existence of a bosonic condensate of massless fermions , the so - called ideal bec @xcite , in the condensed phase of a bose gas . the bosonic contribution to the condensate vanishes when the density of the gas is much less than the critical density , i.e. , when the system is in the normal phase . as a result ,<n> the ideal bosonic bec vanishes and the system becomes a non - relativistic gas , which can be interpreted as a superfluid of bosons , with a density the mass of the @xmath0 quark is calculated in the framework of the relativistic quark model ( rqm ) .<n> the mass is obtained by solving the relativistic schrdinger equation ( rlse ) with the wilson fermion fields in the dimensional regularization ( dd ) scheme . in the case of the massless quark ,<n> the results are compared with the results of the stefan - boltzmann law ( sbl ) and the lorentz symmetry breaking ( lvb ) formula . <n> relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( rqcd ) is the theory of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , which is a strongly interacting phase of matter composed of quarks and gluons . due to the large number of degrees of freedom in the qgp<n> , it is expected that the hamiltonian can be diagonalized only in the fourier space corresponding to the number of quark flavors , i.e. , up to four . at the lowest order in the coupling constant , the only effective theory for this problem is the perturbative qcd ( pqcd) approach @x the self - energies of a quark and an antiquark in the quark gluon plasma are calculated in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we find that the single - quark self - energy is @xmath0 , where the first error is statistical and the second is due to the uncertainty in the helicity of the quarks in the plasma . for the antiquarks ,<n> the first - order self -energy is found to be very small , of the order of a few mev , while the second - order one is about twice as small as the first order one . in recent years<n> there has been a growing interest in the study of the properties of the hot and dense medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) due to its potential importance in understanding the mechanism of nucleosynthesis . <n> one of the most important issues in this field is the question of the existence of a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons in the qcd medium @xcite . to answer this question<n> it is necessary to calculate the contribution of the glu",

called supersymmetry ( susy ) , where the fermion fields of the susy breaking sector have a non - zero topological charge @x<n> . however , susy is not the only solution to the hierarchy problem , as other we present an updated determination of the branching ratio for the process @xmath0 , which has been recently proposed as a probe of new physics .<n> we use the results of a global fit to the data of the belle collaboration , including also the latest babar measurements of the process , to obtain a value for the branching fraction @xcite . in this fit , we take into account the experimental constraints on the process as well as the new theoretical constraints from the babar and cdf collaborations . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we present a new analysis of the data from the belle and babar collaborations , based on the analysis of a new set of measurements , namely , the measurements of decay branching ratios for the processes : @x left(frac1 right)1right$ ] , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic , and the third error is due to the uncertainty in the cdf measurements . to obtain the best fit we use a fit based on a fit of the experimental data , in which we include the latest theoretical constraints , such as the constraints from cdf , baba we discuss the role of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) in the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions at high energies .<n> in particular , we study the behavior of the cgc - averaged gluon density , @xmath0 , as a function of the energy and of the number of participating nucleon - nucleon pairs . <n> the study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high energy colliders ( e.g. the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider , lhc ) , is one of the most important topics in the field of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) since it is directly linked to the physics of the strongly - interacting quarks and gluons that constitute the qgp @xcite . in this contribution<n> we will focus on the role played by the color - spin symmetry ( css ) of qcd in the description of the high - energy behavior of gluons and quarks , which are the gluons responsible for gluon radiation and for the production of quark and anti - quark pairs in the early stage of a collision at a rhic we calculate the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 mesons produced at the besiii collider in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> in particular , we take into account the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight in the perturbative expansion of the strong coupling constant , and use the results of qcd sum rules to obtain an accurate description of the data . <n> the study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the main goals of present and future high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the tevatron @xcite . at present ,<n> the main experimental probes of the qgp are the cross section of high-@xmath1 meson production and the ratio of transverse momentum to rapidity , @x<n> . however , it is expected that in the future the lhc will be able to detect other qgp signals , like vector meson emission , multi - meson final states and multi - particle production , which are not yet accessible to the present experiments . in this letter<n> we we discuss the effect of a non - zero @xmath0 in the production of vector bosons at hadron - hadron colliders . <n> vector mesons ( vms ) are bound states of quarks and antiquarks .<n> their existence is predicted by the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) ,<n> the presence of a light quark in the spectrum of the higgs boson gives rise to a coupling between the vm and the sm particles , which is proportional to the squared gluon mass . as a result<n> , the coupling can be negative , i.e. a vm decay into a quark - antiquark pair is possible . on the other hand , if the mass of the quark is nonzero , it can be positive , that is , a resonance with a positive gluon density appears . the existence of such a resonance has been conjectured in various models , see e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein . however , there is no direct proof of its existence , except in the simplest version of",

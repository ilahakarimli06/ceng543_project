130 , j1700 - 261 , and j1427 - 421 , which were carried out in 2013 july and august .<n> these observations were part of a multi - epoch campaign using the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the atacama pathfinder experiment ( alma ) . here<n> we present results for sgr a * , including flux densities , spectral indices , light curves , spectro - polarimetric observations , as well as light curves and spectral indices for the calibrators . <n> one of the most exciting results from the sma interferometric array ( iia ) was the detection of the bl lac object , sagittarius a*.<n> this source , also known as the orion nebula , lies at a distance of @xmath0 kpc and is associated with the relativistic jet of the supermassive black hole at the center of the ori nebula @xcite . in the light of this discovery<n> , there has been a tremendous amount of interest in using the iia as a new interferometer to study blazar sources . among these<n> are we present the results of a multi - frequency , multi - epoch radio and infrared study of the supermassive black hole in sgr a * , using data from the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the submillimeter high angular resolution imaging camera ( sharc ) on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) to characterize the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source .<n> we obtained 15 epochs of data between october 2012 and may 2014 , with a total integration time of @xmath0 ks . <n> the simultaneous radio and ir data provide new constraints on the underlying particle distribution and the geometry of the emission region , as well as new measurements of the ir flux density , spectral index , brightness temperature , and nonthermal fraction . in this paper , we focus on the radio data in the frequency range of 230 to 690 ghz , which were obtained as part of a larger , three - year observing campaign using the vla and the sharc @xcite . using these data ,<n> we show that the sgr a * has been monitored with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( sma ) , the australia telescope compact array ( alma ) and the very large array ( vla ) since the early 1980s .<n> we present new results from the alma and sma that extend the time interval over which the source has been observed with sma and vla to @xmath0 yr . over this time period ,<n> the alma spectrum has remained remarkably stable and the mean flux density has not increased by more than 20% relative to historical averages , as has been seen in other low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) at both millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths . <n> we have previously shown that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system g2 in sagittarius a * is consistent with the combined emission from an accretion disk , a hot corona , and a narrow emission line region ( nel ) @xcite . in this paper , we show that the spectrum of g2 has also been consistent with a combination of an ionized accretion disk and an optically thick accretion flow we present alma observations of the @xmath0-band continuum emission from the quasar 3c 454.3 .<n> the continuum emission is detected at a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than four and was detected in all four of its pointings , with the last pointing being simultaneous with alma s first pointing . the continuum spectrum is well - fit by a single - temperature blackbody ( t@xmath1 k ) plus a power - law ( pl ) model with a photon index of -1.9 @xcite , similar to the spectral energy distribution of the nearby galaxy ngc 6240 . <n> the spectrum of the radio emission from 3c454.3 was observed with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in the 434 ghz bandpass at a frequency of 6.695 ghz . at this frequency<n> , the sma has an on - source grating spectrometer ( grs ) that was used to image the source with sub - arcsecond ( sub - mas ) resolution . in this paper , we present the first observations of 3c-454.3 in the @ x - ray band at a wavelength of 8 ghz with the we present the discovery of a new class of x - ray binaries with flat spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .<n> these systems consist of two components : a low - mass neutron star ( lmno ) with a mass of @xmath0 , and a high - mass black hole ( hmbh ) that has a mass in the range @xcite . <n> the two components are separated by a transition region ( tr ) at a projected separation of 0.08 fm , where the neutron star s spin changes from positive to negative with increasing fm velocity . in this paper , we focus on the binary component , which has a spin of _ negative _ , i.e. , the system has a _ positive _ spin . using monte - carlo simulations ,<n> we show that the binary components can be divided into two sub - systems , one with a hm bh and the other with a neutron star and dmbh . for the latter case , both components have a spin at the same time , but with different spin magnitudes , resulting in a  negative '' spin for the hm we present the results of our numerical simulations of the stellar dynamics of the central black holes in the spherically symmetric sgra - ii models .<n> we focus on the dependence of the properties of the black hole on the stellar mass and on the angular momentum of the stars . for a black hole with mass of @xmath0 , we find that the minimum value of the angular velocity of the star at the peak of the radial velocity curve is equal to its orbital velocity at the time of the observation , regardless of whether the star is at rest or moving with respect to the line of sight . as a consequence ,<n> the minimum values of the orbital velocity and angular momentum at the moment of observation are equal to the corresponding values for the corresponding positions in the star . <n> we also study the effects of varying the stellar angular momentum and of the initial phase of the binary star system on the evolution of the two black hole black hole configurations . in the case of a binary system with a compact central black hole<n> , there is a high probability of the formation of a second black hole close to the time at which the first black hole reaches its maximum radial velocity , even if the binary system is initially at rest . with proper we show that stellar dynamics can be significantly affected by the presence of a binary component in the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulxr ) .<n> the binary component is most likely a massive star with a central compact object , a black hole , or a neutron star , which is gravitationally bound to the ulxer and is accreting matter from its companion through the ram - pressure of the x - rays . in this scenario ,<n> the mass of the secondary star can be as large as @xmath0 , and the orbital period of the binary can increase by more than an order of magnitude , depending on the orientation of the angular momentum of the primary star with respect to the orbital angular velocity of the u.e. , the so -

flowing in the rhic event , with a velocity difference of up to @xmath1 . in the absence of a strong outflow , the fd remnant is expected to be a relativistic jet - dominated ( rdr ) black hole , but we find no evidence for relativistic jets in the cfh event . <n> relativistic jets are predicted to be launched from a variety of astrophysical sources , including active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , pulsars , binary black holes ( bhs ) and even stars , depending on their mass , spin , and orbital properties . however , it is not clear whether these jets are relativistic or non -

dimensional ( 1pi ) vertices . <n> the symmetry breaking phenomenon in quantum field theory ( qft ) is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern physics . since the seminal work of feynman@xcite and weinberg@xmath0 on the spontaneous breaking of symmetries of einstein s theory of general relativity ( relativity ) , there has been considerable interest in we study the critical behavior of the random -

point solution for the correlation length exponent . using the renormalization - group ( rg ) equations , we determine the critical exponents and find that they are in excellent agreement with the results from computer simulations and ground - state determinations . <n> the study of critical phenomena in low dimensions has a long history , going back to the work of ginzberg , landau , and wilson @xcite on the schrdinger equation for the gravitational field . in their seminal works ,<n> these authors identified the critical behavior of a number of physical systems , such as the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a charged impurity in a metal , the magnetic field in a semiconductor , or the voltage across a wire in a current - carrying conductor . on the other we have extended our non - perturbative renormalization - group ( np - frg ) approach of disordered systems to finite temperature .<n> we have introduced a nonperturbative , supersymmetry - compatible regulator and a supersymmetric - compatible approximation for the  ultralocal '' cumulants of the renormalized disorder , which allows us to follow the supersymmetry ( more precisely , the superrotational invariance ) and its spontaneous breaking along the rg flow . as a result , we have been able to obtain a consistent description of the critical behavior of the random -

momentum density broadening during the propagation of an energetic parton in a qgp medium . to take into account the back - reaction in the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> we also consider the evolution of the final parton according to the kinematics of the scattering process . within the light - front - driven ( lbt ) transport model @xcite , one can study the transverse - momentum broadening and the energy loss of a leading partion during its propagation in a hot and dense qgp environment . <n> one of the most important features of the qgp is the appearance of a deconfined phase of strongly interacting quarks and gluons at high energy density , which can be probed experimentally at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) by the search for a new state of matter , the quarks or gluons , called hadron parton propagation in a quark -

medium scatterings . during multiple scatterings<n> , partons will lose energy as they propagate in the medium , which will lead to a reduction of the averaged energy loss per unit distance over a long distance . as a result , the number of medium partons , on the other hand , will continue to increase with softened spectra which resemble a thermal distribution at later times . to study jet transport and jet - induced medium excitations at the same time , both of the outgoing partons in each @xmath0 scattering are tracked in monte carlo simulations of the lbt model and their parton spectra and jet reconstructions are shown . <n> parton transport is a powerful tool to study the propagation of partons and their interaction with the surrounding medium @xcite we study parton propagation and jet quenching in high - energy heavy - ion collisions within the linear response theory ( lbt ) model .<n> the leading parton propagates through a medium of thermal partons with a net energy density that is approximately constant with time due to energy - momentum conservation and the near constant rate of parton - medium interaction . at the later stage , as the number of these negative \" partons becomes large , they deplete significantly the thermal medium parton density behind the path of the propagating parton and effectively modify the background underlying the jet . as a result of this modification ,<n> the angular distribution of jet -

nucleon collisions in the qgp . <n> parton propagation through a hot and dense medium is a fundamental process in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in the early stages of a collision ,<n> the parton , which is initially energetic enough to traverse the entire collision volume , is significantly broadened due to its interaction with the medium partons . at later times , partons lose energy and momentum due to scattering with the partonic medium . during the propagation of a parton through a medium<n> , it also interacts with the thermal recoil partons which are present in the initial state . as a result , _<n> ( i ) _ partons acquire a transverse momentum , @xmath0 , when they scatter with the recoil parton in the same direction ; and _ ( ii )<n> _ we study jet suppression in heavy -

wave equation of motion for the particle . from a theoretical point of view , in this work , we present a new method for the calculation of the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath0 of a quantum system .<n> our method is based on the use of projection operators to the space of couplings , which allows us to calculate the anomalous diffusivity in a very simple way . as a result<n> , it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the diffusion coefficient in terms of only a few parameters . <n> pacs numbers : : 05.45.mt anomalous diffusion has been studied for a long time , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in recent years ,<n> the interest in this problem has increased due to the discovery of a new class of quantum systems , the so -

this is a very special case of the standard model that has not been previously studied . for the general case ,<n> we give an explicit formula for the time taken by the system to reach a stable state in terms of the geometry and the rate of branching in the underlying network ;

( ii ) the number of different opinions scales linearly with time ; and ( iii ) there is an upper bound on the average number of opinions that can be in a particular configuration at any given time . in particular , this model allows for the existence of a  consensus time '' , which is the time it takes for all the opinions to be in the same configuration . <n> we also show that the model has an interesting dynamical phase transition as a function of time , and we give an explicit description of this phase transition in terms of the model s asymptotic properties . finally , we show how this model can be used to model the dynamics of systems of interacting particles , in which particles can change their state in a stochastic fashion . i review recent work on the finite voter model , paying particular attention to finite - time and finite - geometry aspects of the problem . <n> the voter model @xcite is a popular model in economics , political science , and computer science . in its simplest form ,<n> it consists of a finite number @xmath0 of fixed - rate irreversible markov chains (  particles '' ) , each associated with an independent random variable ( the  voter , '' or  particle '' of the model ) which move according to a markov chain at half - speed .<n> the model is ergodic in the limit of infinite time , but the time at which it stops being ergodic is called the _ coalescence time_. in this paper , i focus on two aspects of this model : ( i ) the geometry and ( ii ) its dynamics . for the geometry<n> , there are two main results . the first is that the dynamics of the finite model on the complete graph is the same as that on the euclidean sphere , provided that the rate of change of the number of particles in the chain is sufficiently small . here<n> i show that the we prove that the mean meeting time of a pair of @xmath0 random walkers on the torus with uniform initial distribution converges to the limit as the number of walkers in the pair tends to infinity .<n> this extends a result of cox @xcite for the finite voter model on a regular graph . <n> we also consider the case where the walkers are not uniformly distributed , and show that the meeting time converges in probability to a constant , independent of the geometry . in this case<n> , the limiting distribution depends on the geometry in the same way that the limiting distributions depend on the infinite geometry , but it can be computed explicitly . as an application of the result ,<n> we show that for a large class of models with finite initial distribution , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the average meeting time and the spectral gap of the associated markov chain . *<n> introduction : * the study of finite - state markov chains has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli and others on the one - dimensional lattice . more recently , it has developed into a fruitful area of research , with applications in many branches of physics , ranging from we consider a simple game in which two agents exchange  tokens '' .<n> we call this the interchange process ;

temperature plasmon modes of a two - flavor imbalanced quark system at finite temperature @xmath0 in the weak - coupling approximation .<n> we find that the plasmonic modes are strongly damped at low temperature , and their dispersion relations are strongly modified by the small-@xmath1 corrections . in the limit of high density ,<n> we show that the dispersion relations of the modes reduce to those of an ideal gas of massless quarks and anti - quarks . <n> the physics of quark - gluon plasmas ( qgps ) is one of the most important open problems in nuclear and particle physics , since the qgp is expected to be a strongly interacting phase of matter @xcite . at the same time<n> , the study of the properties of qgp , such as confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , as well as the equation of state ( eos ) , is crucial for understanding the qcd phase diagram , which is currently of great interest for a number of experiments . the quark model ( qm ) of qcd has been extensively studied in the literature , both theoretically and experimentally , with the we calculate the thermodynamic potential perturbatively in the large-@xmath0 limit and the effective mass of the quarks is determined by using fermi - liquid theory for an imbalanced cold dense quark system .<n> the temperature dependence is obtained by using the gluon self - energy , from which the contributions from transverse and longitudinal gluons are explicitly shown . for the two - flavor imbalanced quarks ,<n> the effective masses are obtained both analytically within the weak - coupling limit , and numerically within the rpa approximation . from therpa results , the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat and effective mass signals a breakdown of fermi liquid theory at zero - temperature . <n> the thermodynamics of quark matter at low temperatures is governed by the dirac equation @xcite . in the limit of zero temperature , where the quark chemical potential @xmath1 is much smaller than the chemical potential of the gluons , this equation reduces to the well - known lieb - liniger equation , which can be solved exactly in the balanced case ( two quark flavors , with equal chemical potentials ) , as well as in the imbalanced case ( one quark a statistical field theory approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is presented .<n> the theory is based on the minkowski quantum field theory ( qft ) of qcd in the coulomb and lorentz gauges , which is transformed to a euclidean statistical field theories ( sfts ) in the presence of a confining potential . in this paper<n> it is shown how to turn the qft into a s ft , and how to construct the hamiltonian and the effective interaction , using the symmetries of the theory , such as gauge invariance , unitarity and unitarity of the energy momentum tensor , as well as the gauge symmetry of the interaction . as an example<n> , it is demonstrated how to calculate the free energy of the quark - antiquark system . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 11.10.kk , 11.15.tk the study of the properties of a many - particle system is one of the oldest and most fundamental problems in physics . since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study the euclidean version of the partition function of a quantum field theory at finite temperature @xmath0 is derived .<n> it is used to derive the rpa correction to the thermodynamic potential , which is found to agree with the result obtained by the exact diagonalization of the qft in the small-@xmath1 limit . <n> the aim of this paper is to provide an analytic derivation of the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) result for the renormalized partition function @xcite . in the first part of the paper ,<n> the formalism of qft is presented , followed by an analytic expression for the rg result , obtained by renormalizing the hamiltonian , in the limit of vanishing temperature . for the purpose of the calculation , the partition functions of qfs<n> are defined in euclidian space - time , whereas the wilson coefficients of the corresponding rg equations are obtained in real time . as an example , we use this formalism to derive an analytic formula for the thermodynamics of a fermionic system at nonzero temperature , where the fermions are treated as massless bosons , subject to symmetric boundary conditions we calculate the gluon self - energy in the imbalanced minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we consider the case of massless fermions as well as the @xmath0 symmetric case . in the first case<n> , we find that in the zero - temperature limit the polarization tensor is dominated by gluon processes , while in the second case the contribution from fermion loops is negligible . <n> we show that in both cases the renormalization group equation ( rge ) approach can be used to obtain the correct asymptotic behavior of the gluonic self - energies . as a result ,<n> we obtain a non - perturbative expression for the polarization of gluons in the low - density limit , which is valid for all values of the quark mass in the range from the weak scale up to the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and is consistent with the rge prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton . for the latter case<n> we also obtain a rge that is in good agreement with the one obtained in a recent paper by one of us @xcite . the aim of the present work is to calculate the we study the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of the two - component fermionic system @xmath0 in the presence of a homogeneous ideal bose gas .<n> we find that the bec has a particle - hole symmetry , which is broken due to the particle - antiparticle production and annihilation processes . in the real time limit<n> this symmetry is restored due to a renormalization of the energy - momentum tensor of the system . using this result<n> , we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the becs , such as the equation of state ( eos ) , specific heat , entropy , and compare them with the corresponding results of the ideal bec obtained in the non - relativistic limit . <n> the study of the properties of quantum gases is an important topic in nuclear and particle physics , as well as in condensed matter physics @xcite . for a system of quarks and anti - quarks ,<n> a bec can be defined as the condensation of a condensate of bosons and fermions into a state with equal number of particles and antiparticles , i.e. , the condensate of the isospin-@xmath1 bosons quark - antiquark annihilation into hadrons is considered in the coulomb and lorentz gauge to lowest order .<n> the quark self - energy is derived and compared with the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) contribution . in the zero - temperature limit<n> the bec is shown to dominate over the vacuum contribution due to the ghost degrees of freedom . for non - zero temperatures ,<n> quarks are effectively decoupled from the becs and this leads to a suppression of the annihilation cross section . as a result<n> , the annihilation rate is suppressed by a factor @xmath0 compared to the case of annihilation into mesons . <n> recently , it has been proposed that quarks and antiquarks can be described by the same effective theory , i.e. , a relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite , where the fermions are treated as bosons , and the quarks as anti - quarks . however , this relativistic qft differs from the standard model ( sm ) in the fact that it takes into account the higgs boson , which is treated as a pseudoscalar particle .",

strogatz model . as a result , the formulation and the tools used to prove convergence results are of a completely different nature ( purely probabilistic , instead of based on the theory of dynamical systems ) . using this model<n> we develop a new technique that employs spatial averaging and has favorable scaling properties . in this paper , we consider the problem of transmitting waveforms over a network .<n> we assume that the waveforms are generated at each node of the network , and that each receiver node transmits a random waveform to all the other receivers in the network at the same time . in the limit of large number of nodes ,<n> we derive the distribution of the waveform at each receiving node as a function of the distance from the receiver . <n> we then consider the case where each transmitter generates a waveform at the receiver node and transmits it to all other receiving nodes . as a result of the random nature of waveform generation , the resulting waveform is not smooth , but instead it is a mixture of many small waveforms , each of which has its own random jitter . for this reason , there is a trade - off between the amount of random jitter needed to generate a smooth waveform and the amount that can be generated by a single transmitter . we show that , for asymptotically dense networks , a single large jitter is sufficient to generate an aggregate waveform that is smooth and well approximated by a pathloss model , where the pathloss is defined as the fraction of the transmitted magnitude at a given distance from a receiver node we consider the problem of joint pathloss and propagation delay in a pulse - coupled oscillator network .<n> we show that there is a unique scaling law for the fraction of the network area outside a circle of radius @xmath0 centered at any given node that is less than or equal to zero . for the special case of a single transmitter and a single receiver ,<n> we derive the exact scaling law and show that it is identical to the scaling law that applies to the case of point - to - point communication . <n> the study of complex networks has a long and distinguished history @xcite . in this context<n> , there are two main classes of networks : ( i ) complex networks with multiple transmitters and receivers , and ( ii ) networks with only one transmitter and only one receiver . while the first class has been studied extensively , the second class has not been studied and is not well understood . here<n> we present a general model for complex networks in which each transmitter and receiver is equipped with a device that can detect the arrival of a pulse and determine the delay and pathloss of the pulse , as well as the location of the receiver and the transmitter s position . using this model , we we propose a synchronization technique for multi - hop networks of non - identical oscillators with arbitrary coupling functions .<n> our technique is based on the notion of the pulse - coupled oscillator model of mirollo and strogatz @xcite and generalizes this model to include timing jitter , pulse width , propagation delay , non - equal clocks , and an ability to accommodate arbitrary coupling function . <n> we show that our proposed technique gives the desired properties for the received waveform at any node in the network . for our proposed synchronization technique<n> , we develop a pulse - connection function and show that it has very useful limiting properties . as an example application of our technique ,<n> we demonstrate that our technique can synchronize @xmath0 nodes in a multi - node network with no dead time . in this case , the number of nodes that need to be synchronized increases as the coupling function of the network increases , but the total number of synchronized nodes remains unchanged . *<n> pacs numbers : * 89.75.hc , 89.70.+c , 03.67.-a the study of complex networks has a long and illustrious history . among the many applications of network synchronization<n> is the field we consider a network of nodes that can exchange time - synchronized pulses .<n> we assume that each node can transmit a pulse at time @xmath0 , and at the same time , receive a pulse with a pulse arrival time at the node that is specified to be zero at the moment of the transmitted pulse . in this work ,<n> we characterize the properties of the aggregate waveform that results from such a cooperative time synchronization mechanism . <n> cooperative synchronization @xcite is a synchronization mechanism in which a group of nodes , each of which can transmit and receive a signal , combine their efforts to synchronize the propagation of multiple pulses in a synchronized fashion . here , we focus on the case where each node transmits a pulse and each node receives a signal at the time of the pulse s arrival at the other node . for this case<n> , it is well known that if a pulse is transmitted at the first node s time of arrival , then it will be transmitted at a rate proportional to the square root of the time difference between the time at which the node first transmits the pulse and the time that the node at the next node transmits it . on the other hand , if the nodes transmit at different times  we consider the problem of time synchronization in an asymptotically dense network .<n> we develop a cooperative technique that allows the network to maintain time synchronization indefinitely given that the nodes start with a collection of equispaced zero - crossings . using this technique ,<n> we show that as we let @xmath0 , we can recover deterministic parameters that allow for time synchronization . <n> time synchronization ( ts ) is one of the most important and challenging problems in network science . in this work<n> we are interested in the following question : what is the optimal tradeoff between network density and synchronization performance ?<n> the main purpose of this work is to provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the optimal trade - off between the density of nodes in a network and the synchronization performance that can be achieved in it . to answer this question we consider a model of a network in which each node has to decide whether or not it is in a state of synchronization , and each node in the network has the ability to synchronize its pulse to the state of the node in which it is located . here<n> we will show that if the network density is sufficiently high , then there is a tradeoff between the performance of the synchronization process and the network s in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the mean squared error of a pulse - arrival - time estimator for a multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) system .<n> the mimo system consists of a sequence of @xmath0 pulses , each of which has a pulse arrival time ( ptm ) , which is observed by a node . for each pulse<n> arrival time , the node estimates the next integer value of pt m , denoted by  e_t$ ] , given the previous integer values . to solve this problem ,<n> we develop the following pulse - connection function : labeli  to mathbb r(i , tgev)right.endarray(y , p ) where t is the number of pulses received by the node , r is the total number of observations , e is the average number of times the pulse has been observed by the nodes , and y is the mean number of consecutive observations . <n> we call the resulting estimator the  time synchronization estimator '' . as in the case of the maximum in this paper , we present a synchronization technique in a multi - hop network where signals suffer not only from pathloss but also propagation delay .<n> we assume that signals are transmitted and received at the same time , but no information about the location of the transmitting or receiving nodes is required . using a pulse - connection model ,<n> we show that our technique can maintain a sequence of equispaced zero - crossings in the aggregate waveform . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the emergence of wireless networks , there has been a great deal of interest in the problem of synchronization in wireless networks @xcite . in a wireless network , _<n> i.e. _ , a set of @xmath0 nodes is connected to the rest of the world by a small number of links , called nodes , where each node has a pair of links in the network . a node<n> is said to be _ connected _ to the world if it can be contacted by at least one other node , say a neighbor , if and only if the communication between the two nodes is known to the other nodes . for example , in wireless communication , the average distance travelled by a node in this paper , we study the problem of steady - state time synchronization in a class of communication networks subject to arbitrary pulse propagation delays .<n> we show that the synchronization performance of the network is determined by the distribution of the pulse - connection function at the interior nodes , which in turn depends on the delay and the density of pulse transmissions at the boundary nodes . as a result of this analysis ,<n> we are able to show that time synchronization can be achieved in networks with arbitrary delay and density . <n> time synchronization is one of the most important concepts in the study of complex networks @xcite . in this context<n> , there is a great deal of interest in understanding how a network can maintain synchronization in the presence of arbitrary pulse transmission delays , known as propagation delays ( pts ) , at the network s boundaries . to date , most of the work in this area has focused on single - hop time synchronization , where the senders and receivers are assumed to know each other s pt , and have perfect knowledge of its distribution @xmath0 . here<n> we will focus on a more general class of networks in which the transmitter and receiver have _ no _ knowledge of we consider the problem of time synchronization in a multi - hop network with pulse - connection and propagation delay .<n> we consider a network where each node @xmath0 is connected to the rest of the network by a pair of pulses , and where each pulse is transmitted at a constant rate @xcite . here<n> , we assume that the network is completely connected and that each boundary node knows its corresponding pulse . in this case , the time synchronization problem reduces to the following : given the set of all possible zero - crossings of the pulse , find a sequence of zero - crossing events that can serve as time synchronization . <n> we study the case where the number of hops in the network grows linearly with the size of the system . for a fixed network size ,<n> we show that the maximum number of hop - per - node over which time synchronization can be maintained grows quadratically with the network s size . as a result , in the regime of high network sizes , time synchronization with propagation delay<n> is asymptotically equivalent to the case of one - hop synchronization with no time delay , where the asymptotic behavior is the same as in the two - hop case . to understand the behavior of time in this paper , we describe a new technique for time synchronization that uses spatial averaging to improve synchronization performance .<n> this technique is called cooperative time synchronization ( cts ) and it is based on the observation that by using spatial averaging , each node in the network can average out its own timing errors . as a result , in the limit of infinite density of nodes , the errors in each node can be averaged out and the synchronization error grows unbounded . in this limit , however , by using the high node density to average out the timing errors in the rest of the network , synchronization performance can be improved . <n> time synchronization is one of the most important techniques in the study of complex networks . from a theoretical point of view<n> , time synchronization can be thought of as a technique that uses a sequence of stochastic oscillators to synchronize a set of nodes in a given network @xcite . on the practical side ,<n> the development of practical time synchronization techniques has been hampered by the lack of general results on how to use this technique to improve network synchronization . to this end , there have been a number of studies of time synchronization in complex networks using techniques such as broadcast synchronization ( rbs in this paper , we show that the delay between the arrival of a pulse and the transmission of a photon through a nonlinear optical fiber is given by the product of the delay times of the two pulses .<n> we do this by showing that if the delay of the photon is less than or equal to @xmath0 , then the transmitted photon has a delay of at most half the delay time of the incoming photon , while for the case of photon transmission , the delay is of the order of the inverse of the number of photons in the fiber . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain that any nonlinear optical network with a power - law power spectrum of spectral exponents greater than 2 will have a delay - to - transmission ratio at least as large as that of a linear optical network . <n> the concept of delay is fundamental in nonlinear optics and plays a central role in the theory of optical waveguides @xcite . in this letter<n> we will show that for a class of nonlinear optical networks , which includes all optical fiber networks with power - laws power spectra of spectral type greater than two , there is an optimal delay between each pulse of the transmission and the incoming pulse that is equal to the inverse in this paper , we consider the problem of determining the phase diagram of a bipartite quantum system interacting with a noisy quantum channel .<n> we assume that the quantum channel is described by a bilinear schrdinger equation ( bse ) , and the noise is given by the haar wave function of the system . <n> we derive a closed - form expression for the solution of the bse in terms of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the quantum system , which we then use to describe the behavior of the solution in the limit of large noise . in this limit<n> , the solution behaves as if it were a classical particle moving in a periodic potential with a period @xmath0 , subject to the constraint that the energy of the particle does not exceed a critical value . as a consequence ,<n> we show that there is a region in the parameter space in which the system is stable against small fluctuations of the energy , even though the energy is varied by many orders of magnitude , as long as the energy difference between the two modes is below a certain threshold . for a finite number of modes , this threshold value is equal to the energy needed to make the classical motion of the",

selected compact groups ( rscgs ) by barton et al ( 1996 ) is re - examined , taking into account known selection effects .<n> it is shown that the catalog contains a significant number of mis - identifications , such as compact groups associated with rich clusters of galaxies . <n> the physical nature of the groups is discussed , as well as the effects of the selection criteria , the completeness of the sample , and the nature of their members . in particular , it is found that the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath0 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1989 ) . however , there are also significant differences between galaxies in compact groups and those in their immediate environments : the majority of hcgs contain only four or five members , while most of those in rich clusters contain more than ten galaxies , indicating that compact groups trace large - scale structure , but are not associated with dense clusters . the distribution of velocity dispersions is found to be roughly gaussian , with a peak at zero velocity of about 1000 km s@xmath3 and a width we present an analysis of the luminosity functions , surface brightness profiles , and ellipticities of the 52 compact groups in the redshift range @xmath0 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) .<n> we find that the luminosities of all galaxies in compact groups are similar to those of field and cluster galaxies , with the exception of the brightest group galaxy , ngc 3783 , for which the luminosity function is significantly different from that of the general population of field galaxies . <n> the velocity dispersions of the hcgs are found to be larger than those of clusters by a factor of more than 10 , indicating that compact groups contain less massive galaxies than would be expected from a random distribution of galaxies in the field . for a given velocity dispersion ,<n> the mean mass - to - light ratio of the group galaxies is found to increase with the group s velocity dispersion as @xcite has been reported for clusters , groups and quasars . however , this effect is much smaller for compact groups than for clusters or groups , which have a mean mass to light ratio on the order of 10% . we review the properties of compact groups of galaxies , their evolution , and their role in the cosmic star formation history . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' the majority of early - type galaxies in groups of galaxies appear to be deficient in neutral hydrogen by a factor of two or more compared to galaxies in rich clusters of galaxies .<n> this effect may be due to a combination of a lack of gas in the group potential well , and the tendency of radio - loud galaxies to be first - ranked optically . in this paper<n> , we review the current evidence for a link between radio emission and interactions in compact groups . compact groups of galaxies may represent the low - density , high - redshift tail of the galaxy formation process .<n> however , the nature of these groups has been a matter of debate for many years . in this paper , we review the most recent results on the properties of compact groups , and discuss their implications for the formation and evolution of galaxy groups . <n> # 1to 0pt#1 psfig.sty @xmath0 harvard -

density universe . #<n> 1to 0pt we study the effect of gravitational lensing on the clustering of galaxies in the universe .<n> we show that the lensing magnification can be used as a probe of the clustering properties of galaxies . <n> _ keywords _ : galaxies : clustering cosmology : theory large - scale structure of the universe ( lss ) is one of the most studied topics in modern cosmology . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the role played by gravitational effects in the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as in the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . at present , most of the attention is focused on the so - called type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , which are believed to have originated from the collapse of a massive star ( msw ) in a compact dwarf galaxy ( cqg ) around a massive black hole ( bh ) at the center of a galaxy . however , the formation of galaxies is also an important process in their own right , and it is also believed to be a primordial process , as well . since the origin of the large scale structure is still an open question ,<n> it is we report the discovery of a galaxy group in the virgo cluster . <n> the galaxy lies at a projected distance of @xmath0 kpc from the center of the cluster , and has a mean velocity of 294 km s@xmath1 .<n> it has a spectroscopic redshift of z=0.18 , making it one of the most distant groups of galaxies known to date . at its center ,<n> the group has an overdensity of about 100 galaxies , which together form a rich cluster environment , with a total mass of at least 10 @xcite . in the last decade<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the formation and evolution of galaxy groups , both observationally and theoretically , due to the importance of this class of objects in cosmology , as well as to the wealth of information that can be obtained from studies of galaxy evolution in small groups and clusters of galaxies ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs . 1 and 2 for recent reviews ) . the formation process of a group of galaxies<n> can be divided into two classes , those which form from the gravitational collapse of gas - rich dwarf galaxies and those which result from we show that , in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , the gravitational lensing correction factor @xmath0 can be as large as several tens of percents of the lensing magnification factor of a background galaxy .<n> this is due to the fact that the gravitationally lensed light from a distant galaxy is lensed into the lensed galaxy , while the background galaxy is not lensed . as a result ,<n> the magnification of the light from the distant galaxy becomes proportional to the square of the magnification factor for the lens , and not to the lens magnification factor , as in the cdm scenario . <n> the gravitational magnification of light from distant galaxies is an important observable that can be used to study the structure of the universe . in the framework of the standard model of cosmology @xcite<n> , it is well known that the large scale structure ( lss ) of the galaxy is dominated by an unresolved mass component , which is gravitationally bound to the galaxy and which can not be lensed by the galaxy due to its small size . at the same time , there is a possibility that the galaxy may be in a dark matter - dominated phase of its evolution  we study the galaxy - galaxy interaction in the central region of a supercluster .<n> we find that the cluster s central region ( @xmath0 mpc ) is populated by a large number of galaxies with a high probability of interacting with each other . <n> the interaction between galaxies in a cluster is characterized by the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , the size of the cluster and the mass of the system . in a typical cluster<n> , a galaxy with a large velocity dispersion will fall into the cluster on a timescale shorter than the cluster lifetime , while a smaller one may survive even if it did not experience any interaction with the other cluster members . as a result ,<n> the cluster will be gravitationally bound , and the gravitational collapse of the supercluster will be followed by a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) , which will eventually trigger an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in the host galaxy . for a long time<n> the existence of interacting galaxies in clusters has been known , but only recently the observational evidence for the phenomenon has been accumulating @xcite . at present , there are about 30 superclusters of galaxies in the local universe . among them ,",

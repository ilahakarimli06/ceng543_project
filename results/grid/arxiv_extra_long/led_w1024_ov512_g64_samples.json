      "reference": "we establish the existence of fixed points for certain gauge theories candidate to be magnetic duals of qcd with one adjoint weyl fermion . in the perturbative regime of the magnetic theory the existence of a very large number of fixed points is unveiled . we classify them by analyzing their basin of attraction . the existence of several nonsupersymmetric fixed points for the magnetic gauge theory lends further support towards the existence of gauge - gauge duality beyond supersymmetry . we also discover that among these very many fixed points there are supersymmetric ones emerging from a generic nonsupersymmetric renormalization group flow . we therefore conclude that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric lagrangian without the need for fine - tuning of the bare couplings . our results suggest that supersymmetry can be viewed as an emergent phenomenon in field theory . in particular there should be no need for fine - tuning the bare couplings when performing lattice simulations aimed to investigate supersymmetry on the lattice .",

armed spiral structure .    _ @@@@@@@@ abrupt transition from bright to faint after about a full turn .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral arms in the outer disk are still rather narrow and are not diffuse , in contrast to other galaxies with different arm brightnesses in the inner and outer disk .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral arms are exceptionally thin .    _ @@@@@@@@ there is some irregularity in the emergence of the two - armed spiral .     _ @@@@@@@@ it appears that there is a single spiral arm in the inner disk that leads continuously , except for a kink or cusp , to one of the two main outer arms .     @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious connection to the inner disk . a short arm or arc emerges from the interarm region interior to the main arm with the kink .    @@@@@@@@ the short arm is initially bright but quickly dims and broadens .   @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious connection to the inner disk .   @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges from the interarm region interior to the main arm with the kink .   @@@@@@@@ the optical disk .     the likelihood that the corotation resonance is within the optical disk can be assessed by comparing the measured ratio of outer to inner spiral extent with the value of the canonical ratio ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ) .    the test using the canonical ratio is not conclusive because of variations due to rotation curve shape .    it is also possible that there is no inner lindblad resonance . to counter our ignorance of the rotation curve ,     it is suggested that a test with a more conservative value of the ratio than equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] should be used ( here , an extra factor of two ) .      in this study, a few galaxies were found that have large spiral extent and whose corotation resonance radius is very likely to be within the bright optical disk . among the best candidates for kinematic study are ngc5829 , ngc6907 , ic0211 , ngc1042 , and ngc0132 .     in this study, it was incidentally found that barred and ringed spirals statistically have more limited spiral extent than pure spirals .      this observation can be explained if many bars ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . , g. 1980 , , 81 , 198 dalcanton , j. j. , spergel , d. n. , & summers , f. j. 1997 , , 482 , 659 elmegreen , b. g. 1996 , in _ barred galaxies _ , ed . . m. , & magri , c. 1988 , , 95 , 607 hewitt , j. n. , haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1983 , , 88 , 272 hickson , p. , kindl , e. , & auman , j. r. 1989 , , 70 , 687 huchtmeier , w. k. , & richter , o .- g . a. 1981 , a revised shapley -

provides a theoretical framework within which such phenomena can be studied , here no such framework exists and one has to resort to studies of specific models in order to gain some understanding of the phenomena involved .    one class of such models is driven diffusive systems ( dds ) @xcite . driven by an external field these systems do not generically obey detailed balance so that the steady state has non - vanishing currents . theoretical studies of dds have revealed basic differences between systems in thermal equilibrium and systems far from thermal equilibrium .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with short - range interactions do not exhibit phenomena such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and phase separation ( except in the limit of zero temperature or in the context of long - range interactions ) @xcite .    in contrast , some examples of noisy @xmath0 dds with local dynamics have been found to exhibit such phenomena .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with , such as defect sites @xcite or particles @xcite . in these models \u001c it has been found that macroscopic regions of high densities are formed near the defect , much like a high density of cars behind a slow car in a traffic jam @xcite . here \u001c the phase separation is triggered by the defects . \u001c it is of interest to study whether phase separation can occur in @xmath0 noisy homogeneous systems such as on a ring geometry with no defects , where _ all _ possible local transition rates which are consistent with the symmetry and conservation laws of the model are non vanishing . \u001c recently , lahiri and ramaswamy have introduced a lattice model in the context of sedimenting colloidal crystals , where phase separation is found to take place without any inhomogeneities @xcite . in this model , there are two rings coupled to each other and particles on each ring undergo an asymmetric exclusion process . \u001c the hopping rate between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 on each ring depends on the occupation at the @xmath1th site on the other ring . however , this model is studied mainly using monte carlo simulations and no analytical results are available so far . where the three densities are equal the model is exactly described by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian .    we note that the model not only has long - range correlations but has generic long - range _ order_. the mechanism found in this study suggests that systems with dynamical rules defined completely locally and _ a priori _ without respect to any hamiltonian , may have a steady state where the configuration space is sampled according to a measure that is intrinsically global .    we note that the hamiltonian also allows us to identify the analog of a temperature in the microscopic dynamics as related to the drive of the system ; for zero drive , that is symmetric diffusion of the particles , the effective temperature is infinite and phase separation is lost .    in the present work we note that a related but distinct three - species model has recently been introduced by arndt _     in the present work we analyze in detail the @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xcite and then generalize it to larger @xmath4 .    in the present work we provide the complete proof of phase separation which follows from the exact calculation of the partition sum in of particles of different species it is of interest to investigate the steady - state behavior in finite - size systems . � we have found it convenient to do this by employing a matrix product technique previously used to solve the steady state of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite . � however , in the case of three species the simplest form of this technique @xcite is applicable only to a limited class of systems @xcite . for the present model � we generalize the matrix product to a product of rank 6 tensors and write the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions � the paper is organized as follows : � the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species of particles has zero density . in section iii � we study the special case where the model satisfies detailed balance and explicitly write down the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions � the paper is organized as follows : in section iv we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as to the following rates @xmath9 the particles thus diffuse asymmetrically around the ring . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the @xmath12 case is special . here � the diffusion is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move . � the system thus obeys detailed balance reaching a steady state in which all microscopic configurations ( compatible with the number of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equally probable . � this state is homogeneous , and no phase separation takes place . � we now present a simple argument suggesting that for @xmath13 the steady state of the system is not homogeneous in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity the case @xmath14 � is examined . as a result of the bias in � the exchange rates an @xmath6 particle prefers to move to the left inside a @xmath7 domain and to the right inside a @xmath8 domain . � similarly the motion of @xmath ite .  神 eventually the system phase separates into three domains of the three species of the form @xmath26 .    in a finite system  神 the phase separated state may further evolve and become disordered due to fluctuations .  神 however , the time scale for this to happen grows exponentially with the system size .  神 for example it would take a time of order of @xmath27 for the @xmath6 domain in the totally phase separated state to break up into smaller domains .  神 hence in the thermodynamic limit , this time scale diverges and the phase separated state remains stable provided the density of each species is non - zero .  神 note that there are always small fluctuations about a totally phase separated state .  神 however , these fluctuations affect the densities only

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ any metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains follow @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore each metastable state has an equal number of domains , @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath92 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the @xmath93 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath94 corresponds to the

and some correlation functions corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) we find it useful to first derive some bounds for the number @xmath97 of @xmath91-states and their energies . in the following such bounds are presented .    for calculating the free energy and some correlation functions corresponding to xmath103 rightmost domains are of size @xmath57 and the three leftmost domains are of size @xmath104 each . ccording to the energy of this state , @xmath105 satisfies the following recursion relation @xmath106 with @xmath107 . to see this ccording one notes that the @xmath91-state may be created from the @xmath108-state by first moving a @xmath7 particle from the leftmost @xmath7 domain across @xmath109 @xmath8 particles to the right and then moving an @xmath6

moves is @xmath109 , yielding ( [ rr ] ) . ccording the recursion relation ( [ rr ] ) , in this limit . for @xmath12 all configurations with @xmath34  embodiments are equally probable , so that the partition sum is given by @xmath120 which goes like @xmath121 for large @xmath5 .  embodiments it is instructive to first present the proof of ( [ psum ] ) for small values of @xmath54 .  embodiments this proof will then serve as the basis for the proof for any @xmath35 .  embodiments we start by noting that in calculating the partition sum ( [ psum ] ) , configurations with energy larger then

@xmath5 sets of configurations . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we proceed to calculate @xmath136 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done by considering all the possible energy excitations with energy less than @xmath131 above one ground state . consider a specific domain boundary , say @xmath17 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 at this boundary can be created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath6 particles into the @xmath6 domain ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an @xmath6 particle moving into the @xmath7 domain is considered as a walker . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the excitation energy increases linearly with the distance the walker has moved . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 is created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain this we calculate upper and lower bounds on @xmath52 and show they converge for large enough @xmath5 .    for this    we have to consider the entire energy spectrum of the hamiltonian .    we have to show that any configuration of the system which is neither a ground state nor a metastable state can be obtained from at least one ground state ( @xmath93 ) or a metastable state ( @xmath147 ) as follows : starting from this @xmath91-state exchange

fall time ( @xmath8 yr ) or as long as the viscous time ( 0.1  100 yr ) .     additionally , a strong precursor effect has been predicted for low radio frequencies due to the potential shock forming between the incoming object and the accretion flow @xcite . in this snapshots of a few minutes duration in each of the eight frequency bands .  embodiments observations of 3c 286 were obtained for absolute gain calibration .  embodiments standard pipeline calibration techniques in casa were carried out by nrao staff @xcite .  embodiments the pipeline produced calibrated visibility files that we then analyzed with our own software .  embodiments table  [ tab : vlaobs ] summarizes beam sizes for sgr a * for l and q band ( 1.5 and 40 ghz , respectively ) from images obtained from all of the data in each epoch . unlike the reduction described below ,  embodiments the images included short baselines as a means of demonstrating the large beams that occurred .  embodiments the ratio of q to l band beam sizes does not exactly follow the expected frequency scaling ratio , which is indicative of the poorly shaped beams from these snapshot observations and frequency -

correlations of the orthogonal linearly polarized feeds .    we set absolute amplitude calibration with observations of titan and neptune and set bandpass gains with observations of the compact source j1427 -

absorbed regions can add to a near - flat spectrum , but also to place some limits on the fraction and distribution of non - thermal particles present .     the peak of a given temperature component can shift by a factor of a few in frequency for different emission size regions or energy partition between radiating particles and the magnetic energy density .     however , it is clear that a peak temperature ( in the plasma closest to the black hole ) below a few @xmath31 k can not account for the extension of the self - absorbed spectrum through the alma range shown , and that a peak temperature much higher than a few @xmath32 k would violate the ir limits .     however , it is also clear from these spectra that a purely thermal distribution can not account for the ir flux .     however , it is clear that We hypothesized that the simultaneous observations between alma , ir , and x - ray , particularly during flaring , would provide strong constraints on the upper extreme of the nonthermal population and accelerating mechanisms .      bow shock emission from the interaction of g2 with the accretion flow was anticipated to appear and peak months before the center of mass reached periastron @xcite .      the bow shock would excite nonthermal electrons that then produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the accretion flow .         the synchrotron radiation is expected to peak at frequencies near 1 ghz and decline with an optically thin power - law index @xmath34 .       the predicted peak flux density of the radio light curve scales with a number of factors , including the relative velocity of the cloud , the accretion flow density profile , the efficiency of nonthermal electrons that then produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the accretion flow .                 the flux density of the bow shock is predicted to peak at frequencies near 1 ghz and decline with an optically shorter time scale variations through an analysis of all the measurements in the three lowest vla frequency bands .    we compute estimates of the flux density excess above the average at 1.0 ghz using low frequency measurements ( figure  [ fig : bowshock ] ) .    we extrapolate the flux density excess at 1.5 , 3.1 , and 5.4 ghz to 1 ghz , assuming a power - law spectrum with index @xmath40 , appropriate for optically thin synchrotron emission . at frequencies above 5 ghz ,    the flux density excess is likely to exceed estimates of any bow shock - related variability .    the 1.5 ghz results alone are sometimes only weakly sensitive to variations because of limited overlap in @xmath10 coverage for the most compact configurations .    [ fig : bowshock ] ]    the average 1 ghz flux density excess computed in this way is only significantly non - zero for a single epoch , 2013 august 08 , with a value of @xmath41 jy .    the excess is positive and comparable for all three bands and very high significance at 5 ghz .    the 1 ghz results alone are .    the new data appear to show higher radio flux densities at frequencies @xmath45 ghz over historical averages ( figure  [ fig : specvla ] and table  [ tab : meanspec ] ) .     the 40.9 ghz flux density , for instance , has a mean of 1.5 jy and a range of 1.3 to 1.9 jy , whereas @xcite found a 43 ghz flux density mean of 1.0 jy and a range of 0.6 to 1.9 jy .     the new data show similar results with smaller amplitudes differences are apparent at lower frequencies .     the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are higher than those of @xcite but still show a lower average flux density at most frequencies relative to the new vla data .    the new vla data show similar results with smaller amplitudes differences are apparent at lower frequencies .    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are higher than those of @xcite but still show a lower average flux density at most frequencies relative to the new vla data .    the new vla data show 230 ghz is @xmath51 jy . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ similarly , for band 7 ( 345 ghz ) and historical 345 ghz data , we find @xmath52 jy and @xmath53 jy , respectively . results from the sma data are comparable . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , increases in the millimeter and submillimeter mean flux density are no more than 20% relative to historical averages , again consistent with typical llagn variability levels . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a kolmogorov -

integral spectrum in the the latter is that it naturally invokes fourier transforms of scattering - angle distribution functions , which from solution of the kinetic equation express as simple exponentials of the fourier -

embodiments this model was defined in the context of the equivariant @xmath2-theory of the generalized flag variety @xmath3 .  embodiments our character formulas were derived from a chevalley - type formula in @xmath4 .  embodiments our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 .  embodiments this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the langland s dual group @xmath7 .  embodiments alcove paths correspond to decompositions of elements in the affine weyl group .  embodiments our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 .  embodiments this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the were used by pittie and ram @xcite to derive a @xmath12-chevalley formula . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ recently , gaussent and littelmann  @xcite , motivated by the study of mirkovi - vilonen cycles , defined another combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this model is based on ls - galleries , which are certain sequences of faces of alcoves for the corresponding affine weyl group . according to @xcite , for each ls - gallery there is an associated littelmann path and a saturated chain in the bruhat order on @xmath10 . our alcove path model from  @xcite and ls - galleries , which were developed independently , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ can be related to each other in the case of regular weights . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the main goal of this paper is to extend the model introduced in @xcite from semisimple lie algebras to complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras . instead of alcove paths ( that make sense only in finite types ) , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the present paper is based on @xmath0-chains , which embodiments stembridge s approach has the advantage of making a part of the proof independent of a particular model for weyl characters , by using a system of axioms for such models .  embodiments the root operators in our model define certain colored graph structures which we call semiperfect crystals . in the case of a special @xmath0-chain  embodiments the root operators in our model define certain colored graph structures which we call semiperfect crystals . in the case of a special @xmath0-chain  embodiments furthermore , we show that our model gives rise to ls paths ( which are also defined in the kac - moody setup ) via a certain process of passing to the limit .  embodiments it then follows that the semiperfect crystals for the special @xmath0-chain coincide with kashiwara s crystals ( called here perfect crystals ) of the corresponding irreducible integrable highest weight modules @xcite .  embodiments furthermore , the independence of our model from the choice of a @xmath0-chain was proved in @xcite in the finite case .  embodiments hence , in this case , we know that our semiperfect crystals are perfect crystals for any choice of a @xmath0-chain . , when a path is deformed into one which passes through the intersection of these hyperplanes .    when a path is deformed into a single hyperplane ( in some cases , such as the one related to the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite , the lost information needs to be recovered , but this is done by a nontrivial lift from @xmath10 to @xmath5 ; the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite based on our model obviates this lift . )    the main advantage of our model is related to its combinatorial nature .    this model is computationally efficient because it uses simple labels for the vertices of an irreducible crystal , namely certain finite sets of positive integers ( called admissible subsets ) ; these can be efficiently constructed .    the main advantage of our model is that, although a @xmath0-chain might be an infinite object , we do not need to store it , since we always work with a finite set of objects ( cf .   we have a finite set of objects , and we always work with a finite set of objects ( see remark [ finiteness ] ) . the study of the combinatorics of our model will be continued in future publications . chains .  embodiments we will give an explicit construction of a @xmath0-chain ( in proposition [ constr - lambdachain ] ) .  embodiments for @xmath16 , let @xmath40 denote the associated reflection .  embodiments for @xmath16 , let @xmath40 denote the associated reflection .  embodiments the reflections @xmath40 generate the weyl group @xmath5 .  embodiments the covering relations @xmath41 , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , define the bruhat order on @xmath5 .  embodiments these covering relations are labelled by the corresponding positive roots @xmath27 .  embodiments let us fix a @xmath0-chain @xmath19 .  embodiments let us say that a finite subset @xmath44 of the index set @xmath22 is admissible if the roots @xmath45 are labels of an increasing saturated chain in the bruhat order starting at the identity element , i.e. , we have : @xmath46    for @xmath16 and @xmath47 , let @xmath48 be the affine reflection given by @xmath16 . for a @xmath0-chain ,  embodiments math67 : @xmath68    we will define a colored graph structure on the collection of admissible subsets . from this , we will deduce a rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations and a branching rule .    the general outline of the paper follows . in section  [ sec : notation ]  [

velyaminov 1959 , 1975 ) and the _ atlas of peculiar galaxies _ While most galaxies seem to be small clusters , they share some of the properties , and pose some of the same questions , as do compact groups .    when redshifts were measured for galaxies in the first compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961a ) , surprises were found .    when redshifts were measured for galaxies in the first compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1961a ) , surprises were found .    when redshifts were measured for galaxies in the first compact groups , both stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet contain a galaxy with a discordant redshift .     it seemed unlikely that a foreground or background galaxy would appear so often projected within such compact systems ( burbidge & burbidge 1961a ) .     this impression was further reinforced with the discovery of yet another discordant redshift in vv 172 ( sargent 1968 ) .      what are these examples of physical association between objects of widely different redshifts , as has been advocated for many years by arp ( 1987 ) ?    it seems that even if the discordant galaxies are ignored , the velocity dispersions rose ( 1977 ) , and later , hickson ( 1982 ) produced the first catalogs of compact groups having specific , quantitative , selection criteria .    hickson ( 1982 ) and hickson ( 1982 ) produced the first catalogs of compact groups having specific , quantitative , selection criteria .   hickson ( 1982 ) and hickson ( 1982 ) produced the first catalogs of compact groups of galaxies .   hickson ( 1982 ) and hickson ( 1982 ) , and hickson ( 1982 ) produced a large body of observational data for the hickson catalog . as a result , it has now become possible to address some of the outstanding questions concerning the nature of compact groups and their role in galaxy evolution . not surprisingly , new questions have been raised and new controversies have appeared .   hickson ( 1982 ) and hickson ( 1982 ) have published a review of compact groups of galaxies .   this review is organized as follows : in section 2 , the definition of a compact group is discussed , along with methods of identification and surveys that have been made . in sections 3 - 5 ,  the observed properties of these systems are summarized and discussed .   hickson ( 1982 ) and hickson ( 1982 ) in sections 6 and 7 focus mainly on  contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . � in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used . � attempts to rectify these problems have been made by hickson et al ( 1989 ) and sulentic ( 1997 ) . � however , it should be emphasized that changes , such as using photometric magnitudes in the selection criteria , are not corrections to the catalog , but are actually the imposition of _ additional _ a postiori selection criteria . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the new criteria are applied only to the visually - selected hcg catalog and not to the entire sky . � because of the difficulty of identifying faint groups , the hcg catalog starts to become significantly incomplete at an integrated magnitude of about 13 ( hickson et al 1989 , sulentic & rabaa 1994 ) . a more subtle effect results from the difficulty of recognizing low - surface - brightness groups . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the new criteria are applied only to ski 1995 ) .      an alternative approach is to identify groups of galaxies from redshift information , as was first done by humason et al ( 1956 ) . with the advent of large - scale redshift surveys ,      it has become possible to identify a reasonably - large sample of compact groups in this way .      barton et al ( 1996 ) have compiled a catalog of 89 redshift - selected compact groups ( rscgs ) found by means of a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey .      galaxies having projected separations of @xmath8 kpc or less and line - of - sight velocity differences of 1000 km s@xmath3 or less are connected and the sets of connected galaxies constitute the groups . the numerical values were chosen to best match the characteristics of the hcg sample , and indeed , many of those rscgs that have at least four members are also hcgs .      there are some significant differences , however : because foreground and background galaxies are automatically eliminated by the velocity selection criteria , this technique is more effective at finding groups in regions of higher galaxy density , which would fail the hcg isolation criterion .      this criterion requires that the distance to the bias .     the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature .     the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) .    the hcgs are not clustered in clusters , but a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters .      this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion .       however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups .    a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups .    a recent study by rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters .    a number of studies of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( vennik et al 1993 , ramella et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , garcia 1995 , importance to the question of the physical nature of compact groups , discussed below in section 6 .    in addition , many independent studies have found significant differences between galaxies in compact groups and those in other environments .    these are examined in section 5 .   in addition , the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , burbidge & sargent 1971 , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters . however , because of the small number of galaxies , estimates of the space velocities and physical separations of galaxies in individual groups are highly uncertain .    in addition , the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters . however , because of the small number of galaxies , estimates of the space velocities and physical separations of galaxies in individual groups are highly uncertain . and obtained a mean mass - to - light ratio of @xmath16 ( solar units ) for the hcgs . � similar values were found for several shakhbazian groups ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian 1989 , lynds et al 1990 , amirkhanian et al 1991 ) . � since the mass - to - light ratios of individual hcg galaxies is on the order of @xmath17 ( rubin et al 1991 ) , the galaxies appear to contain only @xmath18% of the total mass . � the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . � if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . � if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . � the shapes of compact groups were first investigated by arp ( 1973 ) who concluded that galaxy `` chains '' were unusually predominant . however , rose ( 1977 ) determined noticed in visual searches \u001c . it will be interesting to see if these results are confirmed by studies of groups found by automated searches . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if the intrinsic shapes of compact groups are related to their formation process , one might expect to see a relationship between the orientation angle of a group and the environment . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ palumbo et al ( 1993 ) examined the environments of the hcgs , and found that the orientations of the major axes of the groups were consistent with an isotropic distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if compact groups are not simply projection effects , they might be expected to show a centrally - concentrated surface density profile , as is seen in clusters of galaxies . although the number of galaxies in individual compact groups is small , with a large sample it is possible to estimate a mean profile . by scaling and superimposing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the hcgs , hickson et al ( 1984 ) found evidence for central concentration . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ mendes de oliveira & girard ( 1994 ) , using a similar analysis , concluded that the mean surface density profile is consistent with a king ( 1962 ) model with typical core radius of 15@xmath19 kpc . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ most recently , montoya et al ( 1996 ) have analyzed the profiles of the 42 hcg 22 for the hcgs ; prandoni et al ( 1994 ) obtain @xmath23 for the scgs . � both these values are substantially lower than those found for field galaxy samples ( @xmath24 , gisler 1980 , nilson 1973 ) . � also well established is morphological type concordance , observed in both the hcgs and scgs ( sulentic 1987 , hickson at al 1988b , prandoni et al 1994 ) . � a given compact group is more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for a random distribution . � white ( 1990 ) has pointed out that such concordance could result from a correlation of morphological type with some other property of the group . � the strongest such correlation found to date is between morphological type and velocity dispersion ( hickson et al 1988b ) . � as figure 3 shows , groups with higher velocity dispersions contain fewer late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies . � they also tend to contain fewer late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies . � they also tend to be more luminous . � the importance of velocity dispersion , in addition to local in their study ,  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) and rubin et al ( 1991 ) observed 12 hcg elliptical galaxies and detected nuclear emission in 11 of them .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this high fraction suggests that interactions and mergers may be supplying gas to these galaxies .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this idea received independent support from radio observations in which neutral hydrogen emission was detected in three compact groups which contain only elliptical galaxies ( huchtmeier 1994 ) .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) and zepf & whitmore ( 1993 ) found that elliptical galaxies in compact groups tend to have lower internal velocity dispersions than do ellipticals in other environments having the same effective radii , absolute magnitudes and colors .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that they therefore do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other elliptical galaxies .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies that have `` disky '' or irregular isophotes tend to have lower velocity dispersion .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this discrepancy ” sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ obtained a luminosity function for hcg galaxies similar to that of field galaxies . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ their best - fit luminosity function is deficient in faint galaxies , although a normal field - galaxy luminosity function is not excluded .  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that 1991 ) , particularly at the faint end , but it is not evident that the bias is sufficient to account for the apparent faint - galaxy deficit . � on the other hand , the small sample used by ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) may not be representative of compact groups in general . � hickson ( 1997 ) points out that the ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) sample has a spiral fraction of 0.60 , substantially higher than that of the whole hcg catalogue , and contains 7 of the 16 hcgs found to be in a high density environment by palumbo et al ( 1995 ) . � this suggests that the their sample has more than the usual amount of field galaxy contamination . � hickson ( 1994 ) , note that the faint galaxies form a more extended distribution than do the brighter galaxies . � thus they may be a dynamically distinct component , or simply unrelated field galaxies . � hickson ( 1994 ) , note that the faint galaxies form a more extended distribution than do the brighter galaxies . � thus they may be a dynamically distinct component , or simply unrelated field galaxies . � finally , the redshift - selected rscg sample also shows mild evidence for a faint galaxy deficiency . � while the faint a ratio of 3.3% . � for the rscgs , the figure is comparable : for groups of four or more galaxies , barton et al ( 1996 ) obtain a compact group abundance of @xmath34 mpc@xmath3 which leads to a luminosity density ratio of approximately 3% . � these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . � evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . � maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . � evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . � maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � compact groups , with their high galaxy density and evident signs of galaxy interaction should be ideal systems in which to study such effects . � many hcgs do error . � analysis of improved data ( eg . allam et al 1996 ) should soon resolve questions about the identifications and infrared fluxes . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � zepf ( 1993 ) compared the ratio of 60 @xmath35 m to 100 @xmath35 m fluxes of compact group galaxies with those of isolated galaxies and also with those of galaxies believed to be currently merging . � he found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated spirals it originates in the disk . � if this is also true for the infrared flux , there must be an enhancement inwards toward the nucleus , resulting in enhanced star formation in the nuclear region , and possibly fueling an active nucleus .      although there is a clear example of tidal interaction stimulating disk radio emission in at least one compact group ( menon 1995a ) , statistical evidence for a link between interactions and radio emission in compact groups is only now accumulating .      if interactions are stimulating nuclear radio emission , one would expect the radio luminosity to be correlated with some index describing the degree of interaction such as the projected distance to the nearest neighbor .      evidence in support of this was found by vettolani & gregorini ( 1988 ) who observed that early - type galaxies which have a high ratio of radio - to - optical emission show an excess of nearby neighbors .      a similar effect was observed by malumian ( 1996 ) for spiral galaxies in groups .      examining compact group galaxies , menon ( 1992 ) found that elliptical and s0 galaxies detected at a wavelength of 20 cm had closer neighbors than the undetected galaxies .      the effect was not found for spiral galaxies , but if one considers only the detected galaxies , there is a significant correlation between radio - to - optical luminosity and nearest neighbor distance for both early and late type galaxies ( al ( 1980 ) although these authors made no distinction between elliptical and spiral galaxies . \u001c it is difficult to imagine any explanation for this result in which the compact group is not a true physical system . \u001c it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . \u001c stars stripped from galaxies by tidal forces should accumulate in the potential well of the group . and may be detectable as diffuse light . in an early photographic study , rose ( 1979 ) found no evidence for diffuse light in his groups , and was lead to the conclusion that most of his groups must be transient configurations . \u001c however , bergvall et al ( 1981 ) were successful in detecting ionized gas and a common halo around a compact quartet of interacting early - type galaxies , and evidence for a common halo in vv 172 was reported by sulentic & lorre ( 1983 ) . \u001c diffuse light can clearly be seen in hcg 94 , and has been seen in hcg 94 , and has been found in hcg 55 ( sulentic 1987 ) , but pildis et al ( 1995b ) did not detect radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . � high - resolution studies of individual groups ( williams & van gorkom 1988 , williams et al 1991 ) showed clearly that the gas is not confined to the galaxies . in two of � high - resolution studies of the three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . these results strongly indicate that at least these compact groups are physically dense systems and not chance alignments or transient configurations in loose groups . � they also show that many groups have evolved to the point that gas contained within individual galaxies has been distributed throughout the group . � in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . � however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity , and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact - group galaxies . � further co studies , currently in progress , should soon settle this question . � x - ray pointed rosat observations revealed massive hydrogen envelopes surrounding the ngc 2300 group , a bright elliptical - spiral pair with two fainter members ( mulchaey et al 1993 ) , and hcg 62 , a compact quartet of early - type galaxies ( ponman & bertram 1993 ) , and showed that these systems are dominated by dark matter . � subsequent investigations detected x - rays from 18 additional compact groups , either from individual galaxies , or from diffuse gas ( ebeling et al 1994 , pildis et al 1995a , sarraco & ciliegi 1995 , sulentic et al 1995 ) . � these studies showed that the physical properties of individual systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . � moreover , the detected compact groups all contained a majority of early - type galaxies . � no spiral - rich groups were detected ( although mulchaey et al 1996b pointed out that they might be found from qso absorption spectra ) . � these studies showed that the physical properties of individual systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . � pildis et al ( 1995 ) derived baryon fractions of 12 - 19% . � davis et al ( 1996 ) obtains 10 - 16% for the ngc 2300 group . these are comparable to the fractions found for poor clusters ( dellantonio et al ( 1995 ) and are about half the typical values found for rich clusters � . however , the derived baryon fraction depends sensitively on the radius within which it is measured and on the assumed background level ( henriksen & mamon 1994 ) . � both the total mass , which is dominated by dark matter , and the gas mass continue to increase with radius . consequently , both the baryon fraction and the gas fraction are poorly determined . � the contribution of compact groups to the x - ray luminosity function has been estimated by pbeb , who find that on the order of 4% of the total luminosity in the range @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 comes from hcgs . � this is higher than the contribution of hcg galaxies to the local optical luminosity density estimated at 0.8% by mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) , but it is comparable to the 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) . \u001c if the frequency of discordant galaxies is inconsistent with the statistics of chance projection , it might signify the need for new physical theories ( arp 1987 ) , or for gravitational amplification of background galaxies ( hammer & nottale 1986 ) . \u001c initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . \u001c however , such probabilities were recognized to be difficult to determine reliably , because the a priori probability of _ any _ particular configuration of galaxies is also very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects , \u001c can meaningful estimates of the probabilities be made . \u001c the explicit selection criteria of the hcg catalog in principal makes this sample suitable for a quantitative statistical investigation of the discordant - redshift question . sulentic ( 1987 ) \u001c first concluded that the number of discordant galaxies is too large to explain by chance . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of ( kent 1981 , wu et al 1994 ) . physical binaries ( mamon 1995 ) . \u001c the high fraction of hcgs showing diffuse x - ray emission is very strong evidence that a large fraction of these systems are physically dense , and are not transient configurations or projection effects . although the exact numbers are not final , due to the faintness of the sources and the problems of contamination by sources associated with the individual galaxies , it seems evident that many groups are dense bound systems .  embodiments the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties , and the fact that the x - ray properties of compact groups are not inconsistent with those of clusters reinforces this conclusion .  embodiments ostriker et al ( 1995 ) have argued that the relatively low x - ray luminosities of compact groups might not be due to a low gas fraction , but instead could be understood if the groups are filaments seen in projection ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . however , ponman et al ( 1996 ) point out that in order to explain even the fainter compact groups , gas temperatures @xmath40 kev and densities @xmath41 @xmath42 would be required . these appear to be ruled out by both observations ( briel & henry 1995 ) and simulations ( diaferio et al 50 and @xmath51 . � here we have neglected a small edge contribution that is unimportant for small values of @xmath52 ( walke and mamon s case 3 ) . � this gives f(x , n ) = n^2 x^2n-2 now , an observer would infer a galaxy space density that is higher by a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 n^2 x^2n-5 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor of 12.0 for triplets ( or quartets containing a physical binary ) , 3.2 for true quartets fit in this picture ? � recent studies ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian et al 1988 , 1991 , amirkhanian 1989 , kodaira et al 1988 - 91 , stoll et al 1993 - 1996 ) show that these objects are typically compact clusters or groups of early - type galaxies . � although the systems were selected on the basis of red colors and compact appearance of their galaxies , both of these factors result from their large distances because k - corrections and contrast effects become significant . � the galaxies are in fact relatively normal , although luminous ( del olmo et al 1995 ) . � however , the number of blue ( gas rich ) galaxies in these systems does seem to be very small . � thus it appears the shakhbazian groups are mostly small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . � if the groups are dynamically bound , galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times ( carnevali et al 1981 , ishizawa et al 1983 , barnes 1985 , ishizawa 1986 , mamon 1987 , 1990 , zheng et who found that the luminosities of first - ranked galaxies were consistent with a single luminosity distribution for all group galaxies . of course � this may just mean that in small groups the first - ranked galaxy is not necessarily the most evolved . � rather , one should ask if _ any _ galaxies in compact groups show indications of merging . � the relative paucity of merging galaxies in compact groups was first noted by tikhonov ( 1987 ) , from a visual inspection of optical images . � zepf & whitmore ( 1991 ) realized that elliptical galaxies formed by recent mergers of gas - rich systems should have bluer colors than normal . � examining the hcgs , they found only a small enhancement in the fraction of early - type galaxies having blue colors , a conclusion reinforced by an independent study by moles et al ( 1994 ) . on � the other hand , caon et al ( 1994 ) argued that the large effective radii of compact group elliptical galaxies is indicative of an origin by merging or accretion of companions . � zepf & whitmore ( 1993 ) estimated that roughly 7% of the galaxies in compact groups are in the process of merging . � this conclusion was based on roughly et al 1995 ) in which we find strong gravitational interactions . at the other end \u001c are lower density compact groups , such as hcg 44 , which most likely are in a less - advanced stage of evolution . � this picture is supported by radio observations : seyfert s sextet and hcg 31 are both embedded in extended hi clouds whereas in hcg 44 the hi is associated with individual galaxies ( williams et al 1991 ) . � it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time . � the hcg catalog includes several examples of compact groups containing both starburst galaxies and agn . � the hcg catalog includes several examples of compact groups containing both starburst galaxies and agn . � it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time . � simulations indicate that merging should destroy the group on a time scale @xmath54 that is typically an order of magnitude larger than @xmath55 , depending on the distribution of dark matter ( cavaliere et al 1983 , barnes 1984 , navarro et al 1987 , kodaira et al 1990 ) and by at least a factor of two , and may be underestimated because of selection biases .     if there is then the potential problem of producing too many relics .        a second problem is the fact that the integrated luminosities of compact groups are typically a factor of three to four times greater than luminosities of isolated elliptical galaxies ( sulentic and rabaa 1994 ) .    it is possible that interaction - induced star formation has boosted the luminosities of some compact - group galaxies , and that some degree of fading of the merger product is expected .      however , at this point it is not clear whether or not the relics can be identified with isolated elliptical galaxies .    despite these problems , a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    in this case, a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    in this case, a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have detected a luminous isolated elliptical galaxy surrounded by diffuse x - ray emission which is consistent with the expected end - product of a compact group .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have ai 1994 , hutchings 1995 , hutchings et al 1995 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these observations provide support to the idea that tidally - triggered star formation is a predominant factor in the galaxy formation process ( lacey & silk 1991 , lacey et al 1993 ) . in this model disk star formation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( schade et al 1995 ) , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath59 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ compact groups may possibly play a role in the formation of other systems . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . at the other end of the scale , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a unique formation mechanism . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one possibility is that they form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris ( duc & mir systems 5 - 10 times more distant should produce a non - negligible fraction of giant arcs .    studies of small groups may provide clues to the overall structure of the universe .    the baryon fractions found in clusters of galaxies appear to be inconsistent with a density parameter @xmath60 , unless the dark matter is more prevalent outside clusters ( white 1992 , babul & katz 1993 ) .    the baryon fractions found in compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .    the baryon fractions found in clusters of galaxies appear to be inconsistent with a density parameter @xmath60 , unless the dark matter is more prevalent outside clusters ( white 1992 , babul & katz 1993 ) .    the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .     david et al ( 1995 ) argued that the gas is the most extended component ; galaxies being the most compact and the dark matter being intermediate .    they concluded that the baryon fraction approaches 30% on large enough scales , which is comparable to the values found for clusters .    they concluded that given the constraints of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis this would imply What is their role in the evolution of galaxies and what is their role in the evolution of galaxies both past and present ? given the current interest and research activity in this area , it is likely that many of these questions may soon be addressed . ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ________________________________________ [ b]ahcall na , harris de , rood hj . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ 284:l29-l33 [ b]aier fw , petrosian , mb , tiersch h , shakhbazian rk . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 10:327 -

form and the full result in ( [ rdv2 ] ) agree reasonably well . with our set of parameters we find @xmath418 at @xmath419 , about half the size of @xmath410 . � the phenomenological value @xmath406 used above is larger than the perturbative result for the coefficient @xmath389 . � thus it effectively absorbs the ( partly unknown ) effects from factorizable and non - factorizable corrections . � we should emphasize here that the analytic structure of the latter is , in general , more complicated than it is implied by the approximation to @xmath420 in ( [ khfact ] ) . � the phenomenological value @xmath389 in our numerical estimate of duality violation thus corresponds to the pessimistic scenario where the oscillating terms from the non - factorizable corrections to the charm - loop are added coherently . in reality � we expect that at least some destructive interference between the various contributions appears , and the amount of duality violation should even be smaller than our estimate . � our model for the charm - loop in ( [ khfact ] ) is similar to the ansatz originally proposed in @xcite and used since then the systematics and the typical size of the effect , which presumably is closely connected with the @xmath13 resonance structure in the charm - loop contribution . � the high-@xmath2 region of @xmath421 has also been analyzed in the framework of an ope in @xcite and a recent application was presented in @xcite . � our approach differs from the analysis of @xcite in several respects . � we go beyond the work of @xcite by addressing in detail the issue of duality violation and the basis of the ope formalism . � in addition , we extend the ope to include second - order power corrections , which we estimate quantitatively . a list of new results is given in the conclusions . � our approach differs from the analysis of @xcite in several respects . � we go beyond the work of @xcite by addressing in detail the issue of duality violation and the

here we would like to comment further on two conceptual differences between @xcite and our of @xcite perform an explicit expansion in @xmath423 , which corresponds to assuming the hierarchy @xmath424 .     we will argue that this implies that the charm quark is not integrated out at the scale @xmath425 and continues to be an active field below this scale .     we will argue that the operators with charm - quark fields are then present in the ope \u001c .    we will argue that it is conceptually simpler to integrate out charm immediately at the scale @xmath89 , assuming a hierarchy @xmath426 , and that this can be done without any loss in accuracy .     we will argue that the charm - quark effects are then entirely contained in the coefficients of the operators , as is apparent from the formulation of the ope given in section 3 .    to illustrate the point we consider the following example . xmath324 � , we note that the coefficient in ( [ kh6d ] ) has a logarithmic divergence in this limit . � this is of no consequence if @xmath429 , where @xmath351 still represents a hard scale . � in fact , for higher - dimensional operators generated by ( [ kh6c ] ) , that is operators with more factors of the gluon field and its derivatives , the coefficients will scale as inverse powers of @xmath351 . � a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 . � a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 . � the effect of the corresponding charm loops has been refered to as intrinsic charm in @xcite , where the issue was discussed in great detail . � the above consideration indicates how the nonperturbative @ [ abmll ] ) . � it contains the component @xmath439 @xmath440 which receives a nonlocal , hadronic contribution @xmath441 from the matrix element of the nonleptonic weak hamiltonian @xmath366 in addition to the semileptonic form factor terms ( @xmath442 ) . � although the hadronic part @xmath443 is relatively small numerically outside the narrow - resonance region ( @xmath444 of @xmath445 ) , it needs to be reliably computed in order to achieve very accurate predictions . � we have presented a detailed study of the hadronic contribution in the region of large dilepton invariant mass @xmath17 , based on an operator product expansion in inverse powers of the hard scale @xmath200 . working with @xmath25-quark fields in full qcd and factorizing the dependence on @xmath89 , @xmath200 and @xmath351 into the coefficient functions , we obtain the following results :     * to leading order in the ope and to all orders in @xmath116 , @xmath446 is expressed in terms of the standard form factors parametrizing the matrix elements @xmath200 ille is entirely negligible . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have clarified the relationship between the ope at high @xmath2 and qcd factorization at low @xmath2 by showing that both descriptions yield consistent results at intermediate values of @xmath30 . * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a relevant topic at high @xmath2 is the issue of quark - hadron duality , which is closely related to the existence of an ope . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have defined the ope with the help of a spurion momentum that allows for an independent scaling of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath453 and kaon energy . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this allows one to clarify the analytic structure of the matrix elements of the correlator ( [ khconcl ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , resulting in about @xmath329 for the rate integrated over the high-@xmath2 region . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an important aspect is the different sensitivity to duality violation of the contributions to the rate linear or quadratic in @xmath443 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , to @xmath456 or @xmath457 . � we show that the ope of @xmath76 in ( [ khdef ] ) and ( [ khdef ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath458 at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459 ��� we show that at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459 ��� and @xmath111 , right - handed strange quarks can also appear , together with a suppression factor of @xmath103 . ��� this leads to the two additional operators @xmath460 and @xmath461 in ( [ o41 ] ) and ( [ o41 ] ) and ( [ o42 ] ) , which can be counted as operators of dimension 4 . ��� the matrix elements of @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 between @xmath111 and @xmath464 are all given by the standard or similar identities . � exactly three structures can be formed : @xmath476 this can be seen as follows . for @xmath477 in ( [ opdim3 ] ) � the only possibility is the third operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) . � the only possibility is the third operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) . � for @xmath478 we obtain the first operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath479 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ opdim3b ] ) . � for @xmath480 we can write the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) . � in addition , we could form @xmath481 which leads back to the same structure . � this exhausts the possibilities and proves the completeness of the basis in ( [ opdim3b ] ) at the dimension-3 level . � we next consider operators of dimension 4 . � these have , in addition to the fields in ( [ opdim3 ] ) , one covariant derivative acting on the strange quark . � their general form is @xmath482 because of @xmath483 terms with extra covariant derivatives acting .  神 @xmath490 the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmaa ] )   神 is given by ( [ sdbop3 ] ) .  神 the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmab ] ) is equivalent to ( [ gammab ] ) and ( [ oneqq ] ) , and ( [ sigmac ] ) reduces to ( [ sigmaa ] ) .  神 this completes the proof that all operators of dimension 3 and 4 , ( [ opdim3 ] ) and ( [ opdim4 ] ) , can be expressed in terms of ( [ opdim3b ] ) for @xmath91 .  神 taking current conservation into account leaves us with @xmath462 and @xmath463 in ( [ o31o32 ] ) .  神 similar arguments hold if @xmath468 is replaced by @xmath491 . since right - handed strange quarks come with a factor @xmath492 , the two further operators @xmath460 and @xmath461 in ( [ opdim4 ] ) and ( [ o41 ] ) are obtained for @xmath101 .   神 similar arguments hold if

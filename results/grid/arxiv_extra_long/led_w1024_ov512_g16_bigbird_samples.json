orbit coupling ( soc ) .<n> we show that the transition from the gapped to the gapless phase is characterized by universal exponents . in the spin - orbital model ,<n> the exponents are non - universal and depend on the orientation of the oam with respect to the magnetic field . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , we study a system of two coupled spin chains in a uniform magnetic field in the presence of an external perturbation . the system is described by two luttinger liquids , one with oam and the other with soc @xcite . for the case of two spin chains<n> , there is a gap in the phase diagram , and the system undergoes a gapped - gapless transition at a critical magnetic field@xcite which can be controlled by the strength of the perturbation or by the ratio between the two coupling constants in the hamiltonian . here<n> we study this problem in detail for two different cases : ( i ) the case where the two chains are decoupled and we present a field - theoretical analysis of the low - energy physics of the anisotropic spin - orbital model and of the three - leg ladder with periodic boundary conditions ( the spin tube ) in the strong interchain coupling limit .<n> we give a derivation of the field theoretical model from the lattice hamiltonian and then analyze the phase - diagram using renormalization group equations . the system is found to exhibit a gapless phase , a spin - liquid phase or an ising antiferromagnetic phase depending on the microscopic couplings . in the spin - tube case , the spin liquid ground state is two - fold degenerate , formed either by singlets of spins on even bonds and singlet of orbital pseudospins ( chirality in the @xmath0 case ) on odd bonds or the other way round , and we discuss the nature of excitations above this spin liquid phase . <n> pacs numbers : 71.10.fd , 71.27.+a , 75.10.pq 2 the field -

liquid ground state . <n> nmr relaxation rates @xmath0 are the main tool to determine the microscopic properties of materials@xcite . in this work ,<n> we have used nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) to calculate the relaxation rates of the quasi - particles in the ground state of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions . here<n> , we use the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method to study the anisotropy of the ground - state wave function of the 2d model , which is of particular interest in view of the growing interest in the role of spin degrees of freedom in high-@xmath1 cuprates and related materials . the relaxation rate of a quasi - particle ( qp ) in a 2d spin-1/2 antifer we study the zero temperature phase diagram of the quantum sine gordon and anisotropic spin orbital models using the mean field theory of jordan wigner fermions and the renormalization group method .<n> we show that there is an essential singularity in the spin - spin correlation function at @xmath0 , which is the same as in the ising model . for the spin orbital model , we also show that new soft modes appear in the correlation functions above @xcite . <n> the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) is one of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics . in this effect<n> , the electrons are confined in a quantum wire ( qhe ) and interact with each other through the kinetic energy of the electrons . at zero temperature ,<n> the qhe is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian with only nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping amplitudes . on the other hand , at non - zero temperatures , perturbative techniques such as the conformal field theory ( cft ) or the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )<n> are used to study the problem . as a consequence of the nnn term we derive renormalization group equations for the quantum sine - gordon model .<n> we show that these equations are valid close to the xy limit . in this limit<n> , the quantum model reduces to the usual sine gordon hamiltonian , which is known to be unstable at weak coupling . as a consequence ,<n> the bosonization procedure is no longer valid . <n> recently , there has been renewed interest in bosonization techniques for strongly correlated quantum many - body systems @xcite . among the many models that have been studied<n> there are the hubbard model , where the @xmath0 ground state is described by the haldane pseudopotential , and the lieb - liniger model where the ground state consists of a spin wave propagating in the bulk of the system and interacting through a nearest - neighbor hopping term . for the latter model<n> it has been argued that the ground - state degeneracy can be lifted by the interaction , leading to the emergence of a gap in the excitation spectrum . at the same time , however , it is well known that the gap equations for bosonized systems are not completely integrable , even in the strong coupling regime , so that we consider the quantum sine - gordon model on a one - dimensional lattice with an anisotropy between space and time .<n> we show that in the vicinity of the transition point between the gapless and gapped phases , the spin correlation functions are @xmath0 in the gapped phase , and exhibit a non - monotonic behavior in the anisotropic limit . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the study of gapless quantum many - body systems with a strong quantum fluctuation @xcite . in this context ,<n> gapless systems have been studied in a variety of contexts , ranging from quantum spin liquids to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) . for a gapless system<n> , it has been shown that there is a gap in the excitation spectrum at the fermi level , even in the presence of a strong magnetic field . on the other hand , in the case of a gapped system , a gap opens at a finite value of the magnetic field and the ground state of the system is gapless , with a gap function that is linear in the field , as in the usual gapless fqh . as a result",

called  quasi - steady state . ''<n> we find that the phase shifts of the annihilation cross sections are strongly dependent on the density of the condensate , and can be fitted to a simple power - law . <n> collisions of two or more colliding particles are among the most important processes in plasma physics , since they can lead to either the emission of energetic particles , such as electrons or positrons , or the modification of the properties of the plasma , as e.g. density , pressure , etc . during the collision process ,<n> the particles will be trapped in the collision zone , where they can exchange energy and momentum with the surrounding medium @xcite . in this paper , we propose a new method to extract the phase shift of a bose -

energy collision of two heavy ions ( hics ) have attracted a great deal of interest due to the discovery of a number of new phenomena , such as anomalously large values of the mean - field ( m ) moment of the protons @xcite , as well as the suppression of the coulomb drag on the surface of the ions , which are attributed to the interaction with the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in this letter<n> , we present the first results on the transverse - momentum dependence of anomalous magnetic moments ( ams)of the proton at rhic in the collision of au+au at a collision energy of 100 mev/@xmath1 . to describe the results ,<n> we have used a relativistic mean in this letter , we present results of a calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment ( am ) of the muon in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at sps energies .<n> we use the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) for the collision term , and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory for the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction term . <n> we find that the am is dominated by the so interaction , with a small contribution from the ria - rmf interaction . in the case of heavy ions ,<n> our results are in agreement with the recent measurements of the am by the cleo collaboration @xcite , showing that the angular distribution of the emitted muon is consistent with an isotropic distribution @xmath0 , as predicted by the rmf theory . for light ions<n> , our results indicate a deviation from this angular distribution , which can be attributed to the effects of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) on the spin of the electron , or to the effect of the qgp on the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , both of which are in contradiction with the experimental data . as a result we present a class of infrared stable fixed points of the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory recently proposed by seiberg .<n> these fixed points have all nonvanishing couplings and correspond to the perturbative infrared fixed point for super qcd , the phenomenologically interesting infrared fixed points for non -

electron interaction to gauge fields has been shown to be essential in understanding the properties of the cuprate superconductors @xcite , while on the other hand it has been suggested that gauge fields may play an even more important role in cuprates than previously thought : in particular , in the so - called kondo regime , in this work we present a method for the calculation of hamiltonian matrix product states ( mpss ) .<n> the method is based on the solution of a system of @xmath0 coupled ordinary differential equations ( ode ) with an additional term proportional to the square root of the dimension of the hilbert space . <n> we use this method to calculate the mps of the linear harmonic oscillator ( lho ) and the harmonic oscillator with a sinusoidally varying external potential . in the case of the lho and the sinusoidal potential ,<n> we show that the solution is equal to the product of a gaussian and a quartic function . for the quadratic potential<n> , we find the solution to be equal to a quadratic function of the amplitude , whereas for the quartic potential the quadratic function is the only function that we find that satisfies all the conditions required for the construction of a quadratic eigenvalue equation for the system of odes . as a result<n> we obtain a closed form solution for the linear and quadratic mps , which we compare to numerical solutions of the corresponding equations obtained by other methods . + pacs numbers : : 02.50.ey , 05.45. we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian system with a coupling @xmath0 , which describes the motion of a particle in a harmonic trap .<n> we show that , in the weak coupling limit , this system can be mapped to a 1d harmonic oscillator . in the strong coupling limit<n> , we derive a closed expression for the 1d oscillator s motional amplitude . using this result ,<n> we investigate the dynamics of the system , and in particular , the damping of the oscillations . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the problem of one - to - one correspondence between classical and quantum mechanical systems @xcite . to this end , it is important to understand the interplay between the classical and the quantum degrees of freedom , as well as between quantum and classical motion . for one - particle motion in a quantum mechanical system<n> it is well known that the classical motion is damped by the quantized electromagnetic field . on the other hand<n> the quantum motion is also damped , but this time it is caused by a classical force , i.e. , a damping force . as such , one would like to we derive a generalized form of the chern - simons - bethe - salpeter ( cs - bs ) equation , which is a generalization of the well - known cs equation .<n> we show that this generalized equation can be written as a system of @xmath0 matrices , where each matrix is associated with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian , and each matrix has a 1d coupling to a bosonic mode . <n> _ introduction _ in this paper , we consider the problem of finding an effective 1d model of bosonic matter that reproduces the results of numerical simulations of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the bec - bcs crossover region @xcite . for this purpose ,<n> we have used the _ generalized _ cs ( gcs , for short ) equations . in these equations<n> , the 1d bec model is mapped onto a 1 + 1d bose gas , with the bosonic modes of each gas playing the role of the conserved degrees of freedom of the system . from the classical bec equations , one obtains a set of 1d in this work we study the effects of the transverse velocity on the @xmath0 determination of the high-@xmath1 triplet in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . we find that the transverse transverse velocity has a significant effect on the determination of this pair of triplet parameters .<n> in particular , we show that the triplet can be separated into two triplets with different transverse velocity values , depending on the initial transverse velocity of the pair . we present a new method to determine the angular momentum distribution of charged particles in bulk metals .<n> the method is based on the calculation of the two - point autocorrelation function of the particles in the bulk . using this method<n> , we investigate the angular distribution of particles in pbwo@xmath0 , feo@xcite , and ni+feas ions . in the case of feo ions ,<n> we show that the angular correlation function can be well approximated by a power - law , @xmath1 , with an exponent that depends on the field strength . for the other ions<n> we find that the correlation function has two components , one corresponding to the charge fluctuations and the other to the particle dynamics . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the angular correlations in metals , both theoretically and experimentally , due to the possibility of using these correlations to probe the bulk properties of metals @xcite<n> . however , the accuracy of these methods has not yet reached the same level of precision as that which has been achieved for charge correlations in atomic and molecular systems . to this end , several methods have been proposed for the determination of the we calculate the yukawa couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in the framework of the renormalization group approach .<n> we find that the couplings exhibit a strong sensitivity to the parameters of the model , and in particular to the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath0 . in the case of a supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) ,<n> the coupling constants are strongly dependent on the mass of the fermions in the theory . as a result<n> , the sm couplings can have very different values , depending on the values of the gauge couplings . <n> the supersymmetric ( susy ) minimal model ( msm ) @xcite is one of the simplest and best motivated extensions of the sm , due to the simplicity of its structure and the fact that it naturally leads to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) of the usual sm . among the most striking features of the mssm is the existence of a novel phase ,  supersymmetry(susy)''@xcite , which is characterized by the breaking of the su(@xmath1 ) symmetry , as well as by the we show that yukawa couplings of the form @xmath0 arise naturally in the nonperturbative regime of the nonrelativistic qcd equations of motion at finite temperature and density .<n> we find that these couplings are characterized by a single parameter , which can be related to the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the quark - antiquark pair to the temperature . as a consequence<n> , we obtain an effective lagrangian for the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the presence of yukawa interactions . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is characterized by quark and gluon masses and coupling constants . in the framework of qcd ,<n> these parameters are related to each other by the renormalization group equations ( rg ) @xcite . however , these relations are only valid for a small number of parameters , and it is not clear how they can be connected to the physical properties of the theory . for this reason , it is natural to ask whether the sm parameters can be calculated by means of rg equations , in order to have a connection with physical properties . the simplest and most natural way to do<n> this is to we show that the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) can be generated by the decay of the lightest cp - even higgs state , @xmath0 , into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .<n> we find that the branching ratio for this decay is of the order of the sm higgs decay branching ratio . <n> the discovery of the higg boson @xcite has been one of the most important achievements in particle physics during the last decade . in the sm ,<n> the existence of this fundamental particle is guaranteed by the gauge symmetry and by the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . at the same time , however , the direct search for this particle is hindered by the fact that the sm gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , and therefore , it is expected that some mechanism must be set up to restore the symmetry in the electroweak theory in order to generate the observed higgs mass . the simplest and most natural way to achieve this goal<n> is to break the gauge invariance of the theory by adding a higgs field to the action , such as in the case of supersymmetry ( susy ) or supergravity (  we show that the higgs potential in the standard model with a @xmath0 gauge group has a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the origin .<n> we calculate the contribution of the vacuum vevs to higgs boson production at the lhc and find that they are negligible . <n> the  higgs mechanism '' @xcite , proposed by frandsen , pickup and teper , is a proposal for supersymmetry ( susy ) beyond the electroweak scale . in this framework ,<n> the susy breaking is encoded in the gauge structure of the theory , and the vacuum is higgsless , i.e. , a gauge theory without fermions and bosons . at low energies , where the sussy breaking scale is of the order of the planck scale , the vacuum has a negative coulomb interaction and is therefore a source of radiative corrections to the production of susy particles . as a result , at the cern lhc , one expects to see a copious production of higgs particles , in addition to gluons and quarks , which are produced in the decays of the",

armed , grand design spiral structure to the pure spiral structure is a good indicator of the extent of a galaxy s disk .<n> it is also a good predictor of the presence of a bar , since barred galaxies tend to have less extensive spiral structure than ringed galaxies . <n> a sample of galaxies with the largest values of the equation [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio ( @xmath0 ) has been selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . for each galaxy ,<n> the galaxy has been imaged in @xcite , and the images have been analyzed to determine the spiral structure and the properties of the galaxy . in this paper<n> , we present the results of the analysis of these images , along with a discussion of the statistics of the sample . galaxies with two - armed , grand design spiral patterns in their optical rotation curves ( rts ) have , on average , lower resonance ratios between the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) and the outer lindlund resonance ( olr , @xmath0 ) than non - barred galaxies .<n> the reason for this may be that barred galaxies tend to have a limited spiral extent , which limits the extent of the ilr and the presence of inner rings . <n> galaxies with a bar tend to also have an inner ring circumscribing the bar , although it is not clear if the inner ring is related to the end of the bar or the inner 4:1 resonance . for barred spirals ,<n> the equation [ eq_ilrolr]/@xmath1 ratio is lower than for unbarred spirals by about a factor of two , and the ratio of the ratio between inner 4:1 and outer 4:1 is also lower by about the same factor . in a companion paper<n> , we will examine the shapes of the t - r plane for barred and unbarred galaxies and compare them with those of the galaxy population as a whole . the author has examined the kinematics and resonances of a small sample of nearby disk galaxies for evidence of recent interaction .<n> the sample includes ngc 6946 , ic0211 , and ng c1042 , all of which have well - defined spiral structure in their inner disks . in most cases , however , the spiral structure is complicated by encounters within the group or with other galaxies in close proximity . among the galaxies for which the analysis has been attempted , there are several that show clear signs of being disrupted by the group , but others that appear to be relatively regular , undisturbed systems . <n> galaxies in the local group can be divided into two classes : _ _ non -

type galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . <n> our method is a generalization of the method of astron , lindblad , & lewis ( 1985 ) and uses only the magnitudes of the _ redshift _ indices @xmath0 for each galaxy , rather than the luminosities of the galaxies themselves . in the present paper<n> , we apply the new method to the following sample of galaxies : ngc 1333 , @xcite ; ic 0365 - 006 , arp 220 , and ngcs 1333 + 036 , all of which are known to have a bulge - dominated galaxy . for each of these galaxies ,<n> we calculate the central velocity dispersion , the galaxy color , as well as the velocity dispersion and the fwhm of the two dominant components : the bulge and the disk . we present a new catalog of _ hubble space telescope _<n> ( _ hst _ ) observations of bright early -

energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies , it is of interest to search for the signatures of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase in the collisional spectra .<n> the qgp is generally expected to be unstable to the formation of a single or a pair of strongly interacting quark gluons ( kks ) . in the case of rhic energies of @xmath0 100 mev ,<n> the kk s are expected to form a stable pair of quarks , called a kk@xmath1 pair , separated from the parent kk by an energy gap . for lower energies<n> the pair is expected to fragment into a single kk quark , known as a qgp condensate , which will be confined to the central part of the collision region . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the investigation of high energy collisions ( hic ) of heavy ions at relativistic energies ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for a review of hics and related phenomena ) as a means to study the interaction of relativistic heavy ions with the surrounding medium in recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of magnetic fields in space .<n> magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe , being responsible for about @xmath0 of the total energy of the universe @xcite . in most of these cases<n> the magnetic field is so strong that it can not be described by a simple lorentzian vector , but it is usually assumed to be a power - law function of distance . however , in some cases the field can be highly non - gaussian , characterised by steep gradients , anomalous magnetic field strengths , and even discontinuities in the field s characteristics . here<n> we show that these characteristics are related to the so - called  anomalous magnetic fields '' , i.e. , magnetic fields that are much weaker than gauss s field . <n> the presence of a large number of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields has been reported in the last few years , both observationally and theoretically , see e.g. refs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15  we present a high - resolution spectroscopic study of a highly elongated galaxy ( ngc3968 ) .<n> the galaxy , which has a mass of @xmath0 and harbors a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) at its centre , shows a complex structure , consisting of at least three components : a central bar , a compact bulge , and an extended halo . in the central region ,<n> the kinematics of the extended halo is dominated by the motion of the lbv which is confined to the central part of the bar ; the mass of the central object is only a small fraction of the total baryonic mass . <n> the study of the kinematic properties of bulge - dominated galaxies has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli in the 19th century . since then<n> , bulges have been found in galaxies of all masses , from dwarf galaxies in the early universe up to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of galaxies at the center of the local group . due to the large number of components and the relative smallness of the bulge to the baryons , most bulges are intrinsically non - spherical  we study the stellar dynamics of the dwarf nova , sgrs 1915 + 105 , which exploded in the dense environment of the galaxy s nucleus .<n> we find that the supernova explosion was triggered by a massive star , and that the star was ejected from the centre of its parent galaxy , about @xmath0 years after the explosion . <n> the central regions of dwarf novae ( dne ) are highly enriched in heavy elements , due to the large number of supernovae ( sn ) that have been triggered in the centres of their host galaxies in the past few decades . in the early universe , when the density of galaxies was very high ,<n> sn explosions were common @xcite . since then , more and more massive stars have been discovered in the centers of galaxies as well as in the bulges of galaxies , leading to an increase in the number of sn in the galactic bulge . as a result<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of sn explosions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , as these are potential progenitors of type ia supernovae . for a long time , it was thought that multiple arms in a close binary system can produce highly collimated outflows .<n> we study the dynamics of such outflows in the case of a binary system consisting of two @xmath0 mesons , which are initially in the s - wave and separated by a few tens of s. we find that the flow can be described by a superposition of two stream functions , one of which is a gaussian and the other is a sinusoidal function with a period of the order of the binary orbital period . for a system composed of two s- and p - waves ,<n> we show that the velocity of each stream function can be expressed in terms of the two components of the velocity field , and the flow of each component can be parameterized by a single parameter . <n> pacs numbers : : 41.60.ap , 41.75.ht , 41.85.lc in binary systems , the presence of one or both arms in the system can result in the formation of a conical flow in the phase space , i.e. , a  conical flow '' . in some special cases , such as when the binary system consists of two meson it is shown that the relative motion between the two arms of a compact binary system can lead to rapid oscillation of the system .<n> this oscillation can be caused by the interaction of the two components , e.g. , in a binary system with a compact core , or in a compact baryonic cloud . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of binary systems with compact objects , such as neutron stars , stellar mass black holes , white dwarfs , neutron stars and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . in such systems ,<n> the interaction between the components leads to a rapid oscillation , which can be due to either ( i ) a global phase shift of the components or ( ii ) internal dynamics of the component . for the latter case<n> , it has been suggested that the internal dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator , due to the interaction with the internal degrees of freedom of the binary system , for example , by means of the kuramoto - sugimoto model @xcite . as such , the damping of the oscillation is of great importance for the understanding of the dynamics of these systems  we present a new method to determine the number of arms between two point sources of light .<n> the method is based on the measurement of two , three , or more light curves , each with a different number of @xmath0-rays , and compared to that of the corresponding point source . as a result<n> , we can determine the relative number of light curves between the different points of a given point . <n> we have recently developed a method of determining the number and angular distribution of multiple light curves formed by two or more point sources . in this method ,<n> the two light curves are multiplied by a polynomial in the angular size of each light curve , which we call _ angular correlation function _ ( acf ) , @xcite . for a given angular distribution , this function<n> is decomposed into two parts , _ acf@xmath1 _ and _<n> acf_. in the first part , the light curve of a point source<n> is multiplied by its _ total _ light curve to obtain the number _ of _ arms _ between the two points of the source , i.e. _ arm number . we present a new method to determine the number of quanta per nucleon in a nucleon - nucleon collision .<n> the method is based on the lyapunov exponents of the total cross section for a collision of two nucleons , which are determined by the sum of the cross sections of the individual nucleons in each pair of nucleon beams . by using this method ,<n> it is possible to calculate the total number of nucleons as a function of collision energy . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of collisions of two or more nucleons with nuclei , due to the possibility of using these collisions as probes for the nucleon density profile , as well as for the investigation of the underlying nucleon structure . in this context<n> , it is well - known that the cross section of a single nucleon beam is much smaller than that of a proton beam , and that the total nucleon number in such a collision can be expressed as @xmath0 . as a result , the total proton number in a proton - proton collision is much larger than that in a pion - pion collision , where the pion number is known to be around @x we show that the self - gravitation of a black hole can give rise to gravitational wave emission from the surface of the black hole .<n> we find that the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by a relativistic black hole is very different from that of a schwarzschild black hole and can be well described by a gaussian wave function . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the theoretical description of gravitational wave ( gw ) emission from relativistic black holes ( bhs ) . in the standard picture of gw emission from a bh ,<n> the emission is due to the emission of gravitational radiation , i.e. the so - called schwinger - keldysh ( sk ) mechanism . however , in the case of bhs emitted from a compact object , such as a neutron star , the emission can be due to astrophysical electromagnetic radiation ( e.g. synchrotron radiation or inverse compton radiation ) as well , which can be described by the gw - bremsstrahlung ( grb ) process @xcite . the grb emission from an object such as the neutron star or the bh can be enhanced by the effect of we study the effect of gravitational field on the dynamics of relativistic stars in binary systems .<n> we focus on the effects of the central density of the binary system on the relativistic hydrodynamics of the system , and compare the results with those of the nonrelativistic hydrodynamics . <n> recently , relativistic stellar dynamics has been attracting more and more attention from both the theoretical and observational communities , due to its important role in astrophysics , especially in the study of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , as well as in the investigation of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic nuclei @xcite . due to the large number of relativistic particles in the central regions of stellar systems , the relativistic effects are expected to play an important role , not only in the stellar dynamics , but also in the general relativistic effects , such as gravitational wave ( gw ) generation , wave turbulence , etc . during the past few years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the problem of relativistic hydrodynamic ( rh ) instability of the relativistic binary system . in this context ,<n> gw instability is one of the most interesting problems , because it is we have studied the effect of the interstellar extinction on the optical depth of a globular cluster .<n> we find that the extinction of the globular cluster towards the line of sight has a significant effect on the depth of the optical window . in the case of diffuse extinction ,<n> the depth can be increased up to a few tenths of a magnitude , depending on the direction of the extinction curve , while for narrow extinction curves , the depth is almost independent of the direction . <n> recently , we have shown that globular clusters can be strongly affected by the interstellar medium , especially if they are located at high redshifts @xmath0 , where the extinction is expected to be very small , and/or if they lie in a dusty environment , such as in the galactic halo , or in low density regions , as for example in globular clusters of the magellanic clouds ( gcs ) or dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) . to explain these effects , it has been suggested that the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) plays an important role in the formation of globular clusters , both in the diffuse and in the narrow redshift range @xcite . we report the results of high resolution optical spectroscopy of the galactic halo objects ugca and ugc .<n> we focus on the study of the radial distribution of the surface brightness of these objects and compare the results with those obtained from the non - relativistic boltzmann equation . <n> recently , high resolution observations of galactic haloes have been reported in the optical range @xcite . in these observations ,<n> a large number of extragalactic objects have been detected , such as galaxies , globular clusters , black holes , pulsars , etc . however , in most cases , these objects are too distant to be used as standard candles , because of the high interstellar reddening , @xmath0 , of the haloes . as a result<n> , they are subject to the so - called  interstellar extinction problem '' , i.e. , the extinction due to the interstellar medium ( ism ) is too large for these objects to be detectable in the local spectrum of the optical interferometer . to overcome this problem , we propose to use the  extended ism model '' which takes into account the effect of the ism density distribution  we present the results of a study of the galactic absorption of soft gamma rays ( @xmath0 ) emitted by the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .<n> we find that the galactic spectrum of these high - energy gamma rays can be well described by a combination of a thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) component and a non - thermal soft gamma - ray ( soft gamma ) emission component , both of which are enhanced relative to the thermal spectrum of the lower energy gamma - rays ( egrs ) due to the presence of a hard radiation field in the emission region of the hmxb . in this paper<n> , we investigate the dependence of the soft gamma ray ( sgr ) luminosity on the mass of the source , i.e. , on the strength of the thermal radiation field , and show that the results are in agreement with those obtained by other methods . <n> [ firstpage ] gamma rays : bursts ism : individual ( ngc 6397 , ugc 09255 , ugc 07067 ) radiation mechanisms : nonthermal radiation processes the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is characterized by a spectral index @xmath0 , which is close to the kolmogorov value .<n> however , at high redshifts , the agb spectrum becomes steeper and there is a break in the spectral index . in this paper<n> , we investigate the possible physical origin of this behaviour , and suggest that it may be due to the gravitational influence of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the observational properties of agb stars , in particular their spectral index ( s ) and the gravitational redshift ( rg ) @xcite . to study the influence of interstellar matter on the observed agb properties , several methods have been proposed , such as direct observations , non - lte effects , effects due to dust grains , as well as absorption and scattering by ionized gas . while these methods are very successful in the case of the galactic centre ( gc ) region , they suffer from two drawbacks : ( i ) they are based on the assumption of a single , homogeneous , metallicity ism and ( ii we study the effect of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) on the x - ray emission from the early - type galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> we find that the isrf leads to an increase of the emissivity by a factor @xmath0 , which is of the same order as that of the anisotropy of the isotropic emission from this galaxy . <n> recently , we have studied the effects of anisotropic radiation fields on the emission from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . in the case of the sn ia<n> , it is well known that the radiation field can be approximated by an isotropic , spherically symmetric , isotropic distribution . however , the exact form of this distribution is still an open question , as it depends on the details of the model . to resolve this problem ,<n> we have carried out a series of calculations , using the monte carlo code monge , for different isotropic radiation field distributions . for each isotropic field distribution<n> we determine the radiative efficiency , i.e. the ratio of the luminosity of the source to the total luminosity",

      "generated": "we present karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of the galactic center source g2 at frequencies between 1 and 41 ghz .<n> the observations were carried out as part of a service observing program between late 2012 and mid 2014 , and span the time since the discovery of g2 by the very large telescope ( vlt ) in the near - infrared ( nir ; @xmath0 ) through periastron , with the total bandwidth of 2 ghz ( 1 ghz in the case of l band ) for each band . we find no evidence for significant changes in the flux density or activity of sgr a * between the end of 2012 and the beginning of this observing program , when g2 was still known as g2 - a * . in the first year after the vlt discovery ,<n> g2 remained at an average flux density consistent with the value seen in the quiescent state , although with a reduced level of activity relative to historical variability . at the same time , g2 continued to exhibit a high level of variability in its flux density we present submillimeter array ( sma ) , atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) observations of sgr a * at frequencies between 1 and 41 ghz that span the time since the discovery of g2 through periastron .<n> these observations were carried out as part of a service observing program between late 2012 and mid 2014 . for each frequency band , we obtained snapshots of a few minutes duration in each of the eight frequency bands . from the analysis of these data ,<n> we find no significant increase in the level of activity of the source relative to historical variability . at high frequencies ( @xmath0 1 ghz )<n> , the flux density of the accretion flow onto g2 has increased by a factor of 2 , or more , over the past 3 years , while in low frequency ( 1 - 4 ghz) configurations it has remained approximately constant . in the case of alma observations , this increase in activity<n> was more than an order of magnitude larger , and was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the accretion rate , which was also more than two orders of magnitude smaller . <n> we observed sgr a * over eight epochs at 1.5 and 40 ghz with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> observations were carried out with band 6 receivers at 230 ghz and band 7 receivers at 345 ghz , with a total integration time of @xmath0 s . <n> we detected the broad h@xmath1 emission line with an equivalent width ( fwhm ) of 344 km s-1  times 10-4$ ] , where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic , and the third is an estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to frequency dependent weighting in the imaging stage . the total intensity spectrum is consistent with previous observations at similar frequencies , which show a broad , symmetric line profile with no evidence for structure in the emission line region . over the course of its evolution , s gr a *<n> is known to exhibit a range of behaviors , including an episode in the early 1990 s in which it was observed in its redshifted state @xcite . in this paper , we present the results of two analyses of the high - frequency data . we have used the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) to observe the compact source sgr a * in eight epochs at frequencies of 230 ghz and 345 ghz .<n> we find that the spectrum is well - fit by a broken power - law , with a spectral index of @xmath0 , and a flux density excess of a factor of two over the extrapolation of the local spectrum from the ultraviolet to the millimeter . <n> the lack of a break in the spectral index rules out a spectral break , such as would be expected from a gravitationally lensed source , as the origin of the excess flux density . at lower frequencies ,<n> we see evidence for a steepening of the spectrum toward compact sources , which we interpret as evidence for gravitational lensing . in the last decade<n> , sub - arcsecond observations of the milky way s central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) have led to the discovery of a large number of compact radio sources . among these sources<n> are the quasars titan and neptune , the radio galaxy sagittarius a * , ngc 6240 , arp 299 , mrk we present the first detections of the blazar sgr a * with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> we observed the source in two bands centered at 230 ghz and 345 ghz , with baselines of @xmath0 min . <n> we detected the source with an average flux density in each of the bands in excess of that expected for blazars of this spectral type , and we detected it in both frequency bands with high signal - to - noise ratios . at these frequencies ,<n> the flux density of the calibrator source , which is a blazar at the distance of our galaxy , is consistent with the flux densities of the other sources in our alma bandpass , indicating that the flux in this source is dominated by emission from the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of s gr a*.<n> the measured flux densities are consistent with smbh models in which the black hole accretes matter from the halo of its host galaxy with a mass that is a few percent of the mass of the host galaxy . in the simplest models , the mass accretion rate onto the smbh is proportional to the square of the sgr a * is the brightest radio source in the nearby universe , and is believed to be associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of the local group of galaxies .<n> it is also one of the most extreme objects in the sky , with peak luminosities of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , making it one of only a handful of blazars to have both peak luminosity and black hole mass . here , we present the results of a multi - frequency , multi - epoch campaign to monitor the flux density and polarization properties of s gr a * with the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) . <n> we find that the continuum flux density of the source varies by more than a factor of 10 on timescales as short as a few hours . at 230 ghz ,<n> the spectrum is well fit by a power - law with spectral index @xcite , similar to that of the brightest extragalactic radio sources , _<n> i.e. _ , active galactic nuclei ( agns)_. however , at 1.3 mm , we present the first results from a three - year monitoring campaign of sgr a * with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .<n> observations were made between may 2012 and august 2013 at a frequency of 230 ghz and included a total of @xmath0 hours of on - source integration time . in total , we observed five submillimeter galaxies , uranus , neptune , j1733 - 130 , and titan , as well as the quasar field of sagittarius a * , which is located near the southern edge of the ophiuchus superbubble . <n> the sma observations show that the millimeter wavelength emission from s gr a * is dominated by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission , with a mean spectral index of 0.5 between 230 and 690 ghz , consistent with previous measurements from the very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma )<n> . however , the mean flux density at 230 to 670 ghz is lower than previously measured at vla and alma , by a factor of 2 or more , indicating that the spectral index is flatter at millimeter wavelengths we present simultaneous submillimeter and radio continuum observations of sgr a * using the very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> we find that the millimeter and submillimeter spectral indices are consistent with a flat or slightly declining power - law spectrum over the frequency range between 230 and 690 ghz , with no evidence for spectral curvature or greater steepening . the mean flux density between 1 and 40 ghz<n> is @xmath0 mjy , and the spectral index between 40 and 695 ghz is between 0.5 and 0.8 , consistent with previous estimates in the literature . in the near - infrared ( nir )<n> , we find evidence for a steepening in the spectrum between @xcite , which is consistent with the transition to higher linear polarization at higher frequencies and the increase in variability with wavelength . <n> the variability of the flux density of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of our galaxy , sagittarius a * , has long been known to be variable at radio and nir wavelengths , as was first discovered by the parkes radio telescope in the 1960 s . since we present the results of a multi - frequency study of sgr a * using the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) , the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory , and the very large telescope ( vlt ) and keck adaptive optics ( ao ) interferometers .<n> the combination of alma and ir data provides the best constraints yet on the shape of the radiating particle distributions and on the underlying particle distribution , allowing us to constrain the physical parameters of the particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification mechanisms in this system . <n> the high angular resolution of the alma observations allows us to resolve the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the compact object , with a resolution of @xmath0 arcsec and a spectral resolving power of about 100@xmath1 . from these data<n> we derive the following spectral parameters : a power - law photon index in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 , a mean flux density in the frequency range 230 to 690 ghz of about @xcite , an ir - to - radio flux ratio in the ir of about 100:1 and an  we present the results of a multi - frequency , multi - epoch alma observation of the radio continuum emission from the microquasar g2 near periastron .<n> the data were collected between october 2012 and may 2014 . during this period of time<n> , g2 observed a number of rapid flares , including a @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 flare in october 2013 , followed by a quiescent period in which the ir to x - ray flux ratio remained close to unity . in the course of these observations ,<n> the 1 ghz flux density increased by at most 12 mjy ( 2% ) in the lowest frequency bands ( 1.5 , 3.1 , and 5.4 ghz ) and by more than an order of magnitude in the intermediate frequency ranges . at frequencies above 5 ghz<n> the flux density excess rises rapidly and is likely to be a power - law , appropriate for optically thin synchrotron emission . <n> the radio emission from g2 was expected to be powered by nonthermal electrons accelerated by a bow shock in the magnetic field of the accretion flow that surrounds the central black hole @xcite . as the center of mass of the g2 system approached perias we have used the very large array ( vla ) to observe the radio continuum emission from the bow shock in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 .<n> the observations were made over 15 epochs between 2012 october and 2014 may . in the first year of operation ,<n> the average 1 ghz radio continuum flux density was @xmath0 jy , which is @xcite s upper limit . for the next year and a half , the flux density increased to a mean of 0.8 jy at 1 mhz , a value consistent with theoretical predictions . between 2013<n> september 18 and 2013 august 08 , there was only a 4% change in the average flux density at 1.5 ghz , with a significance of 1.8 jy ( 95% confidence ) . by the end of this experiment , on 2013 september 18 , no significant variation in the radio flux density could be detected in the three lowest vla frequency bands , 1.4 , 3.1 , and 5.4 ghz with upper limits of 0.4 , 0.8 , or 0.9 jy on the average , respectively . at 5 ghz<n> , we have detected a higher level of flux density than predicted by theoretical we present new submillimeter array ( sma ) and very large array ( vla ) observations of the low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) sgr a * between 2013 august and 2015 september .<n> the sma data were obtained in the band 7 ( 345 ghz ) with a resolution of @xmath0 , while the vla observations were obtained at 1.4 , 3.1 , and 40.9 ghz with resolutions of 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively . in all three bands ,<n> the average 1 ghz flux density is significantly higher than historical averages , with a mean value of 1.0 jy and a range of 1.3 to 1.9 jy . for 11 of 15 epochs , the 95% confidence upper limit on the average flux density excess is 0.4 jy<n> . these results can be attributed to the magnetically arrested cloud derived by @xcite or to a pressure - confined stellar wind . a comparison against historical millimeter and submillimeter flux densities also does not reveal any significant change . over the last decade , vlbi observations at centimeter wavelengths have revealed a growing number of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the milky way . among these sgr a * is the prototype of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) .<n> the periastron passage of the supermassive black hole at the center of this seyfert galaxy has been observed for more than 30 years with the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( sma ) and at an average rate of @xmath0 yr@xmath1 with the very large array ( vla ) at 230 ghz . in this paper , we present new results from the vla and alma as well as sma observations of the millimeter and submillimeter spectral energy distributions ( seds ) over the same time period . from the sma data ,<n> we find that the rms variability over the entire sma and vla data spans @xcite s 10 yr , which is comparable to the variability seen in the near - infrared ( nir ) continuum . <n> the millimeter , submillimeter , and millimeter - nir data span timescales from minutes to years and are consistent with each other , with no evidence for significant variations in the spectral index , variability amplitude , or mean flux density . on the other hand we present new vla , alma , and sma observations of sgr a*. over the past three decades , the source has undergone at least three epochs of significant flux and spectral changes .<n> the most dramatic of these changes occurred during the periastron passage of g2 , when the flux density varied by more than a factor of @xmath0 and the spectrum changed from a simple power law to a steeper power law with increasing frequency . in the case of low - frequency radio emission ,<n> the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock , which is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models , to be a few schwarzschild radii . at longer wavelengths , there is no evidence for an enhancement of emission relative to historical averages , as might be expected if g2 was on a plunging orbit due to tidal disruption or a spread in orbital characteristics . <n> the nature of the compact radio source associated with g2 has been a source of debate since its first detection in the early 1970 s . @xcite<n> have proposed a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent we present the results of a multi - frequency study of sgr a * using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> this is the first alma study of a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) at submillimeter wavelengths . <n> g2 is a @xmath0 gyr old , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) that harbors a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and is the brightest source in the low - frequency portion of the spectrum ( lfs ) of this class of objects . in this paper , we present results from the first three years of alma monitoring of g2 . we find that the alma spectrum is flat , with no evidence for a spectral break , over the entire frequency range of 100 to 950 ghz . at shorter wavelengths ,<n> the mean flux density has not changed by more than a factor of two over the past 10 years , which is within the range of variations seen in the past and in other llgn . the long - term stability of the radio / millimeter spectrum indicates that episodic events such as a fully disrupted cloud falling onto the black hole are rare  sgr a * is a supermassive black hole at the center of the archetypical active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , g2 , and has been the target of a multi - year monitoring campaign with the event horizon telescope ( eht ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) and with the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) in the submillimeter regime .<n> we present the results of a submillimeter spectral and timing analysis of the data obtained with the alma and the eht over the course of the monitoring campaign . <n> the millimeter spectrum is flat , with a spectral index of @xmath0 , consistent with that expected for the emission from an optically thick accretion disk , although the value is somewhat higher than that expected from the doppler boosting of the radiation from the black hole gravitational lensing effect @xcite . from the timing analysis<n> , we find that the average free - fall time of g2 is @xxmath1 yr , which is short compared to the free - falling time of the accretion flow . over the duration of the campaign ,<n> the average flux density of the source has increased by a factor of we present alma observations of the @xmath0co j=1 - 0 line of the hulse taylor dwarf galaxy ngc 6946 .<n> this is one of the first submillimeter observations of a well - studied dwarf galaxy in the lyman limit ( lbr ) , a regime where the continuum emission is dominated by the ionized gas , and the continuum spectrum is well - described by a single - temperature blackbody ( t@xmath1 k ) plus a power - law ( pl ) component , which we interpret as a thermal bremsstrahlung ( tpbl ) emission from the hot dust in the galaxy . <n> the presence of warm dust in dwarf galaxies , such as our own , poses a problem for studies of the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies and their environments , as well as studies of large - scale structures in galaxies such as clusters , galaxies and clusters of galaxies . to resolve this issue ,<n> it is necessary to measure the temperature of the dust , in particular , to determine whether the dust is thermalized or non - thermal in nature . in order to determine the degree to which the dust in our galaxy is t we report on the development of a new method for the fabrication and characterization of one - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) , based on the application of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) to a tis sample .<n> the stm technique is used to obtain a high spatial resolution image of the sample , which is then used to characterize the electronic properties of the tis in the bulk , and in thin film samples by scanning tunneling microscopy . using this technique ,<n> we have demonstrated the formation of metallic , semiconducting and insulating tis for a wide range of sample parameters , including magnetic field , volume fraction , layer thickness and sample temperature . <n> tis are one of the most promising materials in the field of ultra - thin - film electronics @xcite , due to their high transition temperature ( @xmath0k ) and high bulk modulus , as well as their unique electronic and magnetic properties . in recent years<n> , stm techniques have been applied to a variety of materials , such as transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) @x<n> . however , it has not been possible to fabricate one - we report on the development of a novel method for the fabrication and characterization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices .<n> the method is based on the application of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) to a periodic array of optical elements , such as tips , couplers , and couplers between neighboring elements . for the first time , we demonstrate the operation of such an amplifier in a 1d geometry , by applying it to a 2d array of coupled optical elements and observing the response of the array to the amplifier s output . <n> optical parametric amplifiers ( opos ) @xcite are one of the most powerful tools for the study of nonlinear phenomena , especially in the presence of nonlinearity . in nonlinear systems ,<n> parametric amplifiers are often used as quantum - mechanical ( qm ) mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometers to probe the nonlinear properties of the system , as well as to determine the fundamental parameters of the nonlinear response . however , in many cases , parametric amplifiers can not be directly used to measure the nonlinear optical response , because the nonlinearity in the system is not captured by the parametric amplifier  we report on the development of a new method for the direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) , i.e. , gravitational wave detection by time - of - flight measurements .<n> this method is based on the measurement of the time - resolved intensity profile of the gw signal , which is then used to determine the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal . <n> the advent of high - resolution gw interferometry @xcite has led to the discovery of new classes of gravitational wave systems , such as gravitational gw double - slits ( gws ) and gw - double - fan ( gdf ) systems @xmath0 . in a gwf ,<n> a pair of spatially separated , counter - propagating , spatially - separated gravitational waves are emitted at the same time , and the relative phase between the two wave pairs is known as the _ relative gw phase _ ( _ pwp _ ) of the system . a gdf is a double - slit system , while a wf is a single - slit one . for a system consisting of two gws separated by a gw pair , the relative wf phase is @x we present a multi - wavelength study of the gravitational lensing properties of a sample of eight gravitationally lensed binaries at redshifts @xmath0 .<n> we find that the lensing magnification depends strongly on lens redshift , with a power - law index of -2.89 for the highest magnifications and steeper index for the lowest magnifications , consistent with lensing by black holes . on the other hand , for magnifications below a certain threshold ,<n> the magnification increases with redshift for all lens pairs , indicating that the magnification depends on the lens s redshift rather than on the source s luminosity . <n> gravitational lenses ( gfs ) are lensing systems in which the magnification of a single image is measured to be proportional to the lens magnification . in the standard model of lensing , the magnification is defined as the ratio of the einstein ring radius to the sphere radius . for a source at a lens red shift of @xcite<n> , this quantity is defined to be the ratio between the lens center - of - mass velocity dispersion and the radius of the lens at the source red shift , multiplied by the product of the ring radius and the lens diameter . the we present the results of a study of the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) at redshifts @xmath0 using high - resolution , high - s / n , very large array ( vla ) and very large telescope ( vlt ) data .<n> we focus our study on the collision dynamics of a pair of relativistic , co - eval , ultracompact binaries ( ucb ) , and compare their total luminosities to those of a binary system composed of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with a main - sequence ( ms) star and a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . <n> we find that the collision velocities of the two systems are very similar , with a typical ratio of the hic velocities of 0.65 . however , the total luminosity of the system is significantly lower than that of the ms system , which we attribute to the lower mass of the bsgs , as well as to the presence of a higher mass companion , both of which play an important role in the dynamics of the collision . in the case of the binary system<n> , we find we study the dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment on the angular momentum of the stars in the vicinity of the sub - chandrasekhar limit with the help of numerical simulations .<n> we find that the anomalous magnetization increases with the angular excitation of the star and is maximal for the stars with angular excitations of @xmath0 , while it decreases for the oppositely directed stars . <n> the anomalous magneto - dipole ( amd ) effect is a general phenomenon in which the magnetization of the stellar surface is larger than that of the surrounding material due to the interaction of the magnetized surface with the stellar magnetic field . in the case of the isotropic and anisotropic magnetization<n> , the anisotropy of the amd effect is well described by the isothermal model , whereas in the absence of the interaction between the magnetised surface and the stellar field the anisostatic model is valid . for an isotropic star ,<n> the anitropy is determined by the surface magnetization and is independent of the orientation of the surface relative to the line of sight . however , for an astrophysical star with an anisomorphic magnetization , there is an additional parameter which depends on the we use semi - analytical techniques to study the dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) of the milky way galaxy on the baryon density .<n> we find that the amm of the galaxy is very sensitive to the density of the subhorizon baryons in the galaxy , and can be as large as @xmath0 times larger than that of the central black hole , if the central subhorizon is as dense as possible . <n> we also study the influence of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and the orbital eccentricity of the system on the amplitude and phase of the angular momenta of the stars in the galactic plane . for a fixed orbital eccentricity , the amplitude of the oam is inversely proportional to the angular size of the star , while for a given orbital eccentricity the amplitude is proportional to its angular size . as a consequence ,<n> the anomalous amm depends strongly on the angular momentum of the galactic stars , but not on the eccentricity of their central black holes . we report the discovery of a pair of x - ray pulsars ( psr j0737 + 4849 and psrs j0748 + 4809 ) from the 3d - hst survey .<n> both pulsars are detected at high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) , and both are seen to be moving away from the center of their host galaxy with velocities near the expected location of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the centre of the host galaxy . <n> we also report the detection of a previously uncatalogued pair of pulsars from the survey , which we are identifying as psrj0737 - 4849 + 4814 . in the accompanying papers ,<n> we show that these two pairs are associated with a previously known pair of blue - shifted pulsars , psrr j0750 + 4748 and psprs j0128 + 4824 , with a total of four pulsar pairs detected in total . the pulsar pairs are found to be separated by 0.23 mhz in orbital phase , making them likely to be gravitationally bound , the second such pair detected by the _ chandra _<n> x - we study the stellar dynamics of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ngc3109 , sgrastar , lrrrrr and ic443 using high - resolution , high - s / n spectroscopy .<n> we find that , in contrast to previous studies , the stellar surface density of these galaxies is significantly higher than that of the quasars , and that the angular momentum of the central black holes is higher than in the sgr and lrrrrr . <n> _ introduction : _ ulirgirgs are among the most luminous galaxies in the universe due to their high surface brightness , large central black hole masses and the fact that they are located at cosmological distances , making them ideal candidates to study the cosmological evolution of the galaxy and the formation of the structure that is currently known in the early universe @xcite . in these galaxies ,<n> the stellar angular momentum is generated by the interaction of the stellar wind with the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , which is represented by a dense molecular cloud ( mc ) surrounding the central object . as a result , a large fraction of the total luminosity of these  we present the results of the gravitational lensing analysis of three gravitationally lensed binaries from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) high - resolution ( @xmath0 ) survey of the co - moving gravitational lens system sgrastar .<n> the angular separations of the systems range from 3 milliarcseconds ( rms ) to more than a kiloparsecs ( kpc ) , allowing us to study the lensing properties of the individual binaries and their co lenses . <n> we show that the angular resolution of wfcam is sufficient to resolve the co lens in the majority of the cases , even when the separations are as small as a few au , thus allowing for the investigation of the lens - mass relation and lens - separation degeneracy . in the limit of small separations ,<n> the lens mass is well represented by a power - law , with an exponential cutoff , for each pair of lensed objects , independent of their angular separation , and independent of the mass of the central compact object , provided that the lens and the companion are separated by less than the we present a study of the gravitational lensing properties of the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , based on the high resolution spectroscopic data obtained with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at the las campanas observatory ( lco ) in the energy range of @xmath0 .<n> we find that the lensing magnification depends strongly on the orbital phase of the source , with small values of magnification occurring for short orbital periods , while for long orbital periods the magnification increases with decreasing orbital phase . in the long period limit ,<n> the magnifications increase linearly with increasing orbital period , whereas in the short period limit they decrease quadratically . for a given orbital period<n> , the magnification depends on the ratio of the orbital separation of the lens to the gravitational radius of the central black hole , which is a measure of the mass ratio between the lens and its companion , and can be used to estimate the lens s orbital separation . <n> the study of lensing is one of the most important tools to study the formation and evolution of galaxies , as well as the interaction between agn and the surrounding interstellar medium . since the formation of the first agn in the early we show that the extragalactic black hole ( bh ) companion to the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulxr ) sgr a * , discovered by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in june 2013 , is a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with a mass of at least @xmath0 .<n> the companion is most likely an ultracompact hii region ( uchii ) as its mass exceeds that of the host bh , and the two bsgs share a common proper motion . the companion s mass and angular momentum are well described by the mass of the bh and the angular momentum of its companion , which are both equal to the orbital angular velocity of the system , with the former being larger than the latter by a factor of more than 10 . <n> the ultrarelativistic nature of the pulsar ( ps ) makes it an ideal candidate to study the effects of mass accretion from the pulsar wind on the evolution of its mass , angular momentum and energy density , as well as on the pulsar s spin and orbital angular momentum . in this work ,<n> we study the evolution we present high - resolution spectroscopy of the _ hst _ wfpc2 x - ray pulsars sdss j0805 - 3658 ( @xmath0 ) and sloan j0817 - 3050 ( @ xmath1 ) .<n> we find that both pulsars were close to the galactic center at the time of their respective peaks in the light curve , and that the peak of the first radial velocity component of the pulsar was offset from the galactic systemic velocity by @x.<n> this implies that the pulsars are in a close binary system , which is consistent with the roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) scenario for the formation of the millisecond pulsar ( ps ) in the standard model ( sm ) of the early universe . <n> the discovery of the ps by fermi in the 1960 s @xcite , followed by the chandrasekhar - fermi ( cff ) discovery in the 1970 s of the ultrarelativistic pulsars ( urs ) psr 1915 + 105 and psrs 1914 + 105 , is one of the most important developments in modern astrophysics . in the sm , we report on the discovery of a pair of gravitationally bound black holes in a binary system .<n> the black holes are separated by about 10 gravitational radii and the binary system has a common proper motion of the two black holes , which is equal to the orbital period of the system , and the separation is @xmath0 gravitational radii . in the standard model of black hole formation ,<n> the minimum mass of a black hole is set by the mass of the black hole itself , while the maximum mass is given by the ratio of the gravitational redshift of the binary to the binary redshift . <n> the formation of black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is common in both the milky way ( mw ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but the nature of bhs in these galaxies is not well understood . since most bhs form in binary systems , it is reasonable to assume that the bh mass distribution in agn is skewed towards a hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram with a large mass ratio between the bh and its companion , as is often done in the study of gravitational waves ( gws  we report the discovery of two new ultrarelativistic heavy -

hilbert ( rhm ) operators , each of which is associated with a scalar field . as such , rn field theories have been extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been extensively studied in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally .<n> one of the most prominent of these is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , introduced by sakharov in 1983@xcite . in this theory ,<n> the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the electroweak scale . at the same time , supersymmetry breaking is _ not _ invariant under susy - breaking , so that the theory is restricted to one copy . <n> recently , we have shown that this restriction can be relaxed by means of grassmannian ultralocality ( wt ) in the context of the minimal susy sm . here<n> we show how wt can be used to derive the flow equations for susy breaking in this model , and we give explicit results for the case where the cut - off is chosen to be of the same order as the curvature of the theory at the origin , as in the case of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite<n> . then , within a nonperturbative implementation of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for a scalar field theory in dimension @xmath0 , we show that the supersymmetry of the theory implies the property of dimensional reduction .<n> the rg flow equation ( erge ) for the effective average action is shown to be identical to the erge for the average action of a standard scalar field in dimension two . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of quantum field theory ( qft ) . in susy<n> there are two essential ingredients : ( i ) susy breaking and ( ii ) supersymmetry breaking due to the presence of a gauge field . for a theory to be susy it needs to have a non - trivial effective action , _<n> i.e. _ it must have a renormalizable equation of state ( eos ) @xcite , which can be written as the following : i_k1(2 ) + phi delta_b2 ,int dd-2y_2$ ] , where gamma k we present a nonperturbative implementation of the renormalization -

hilbert ( rn ) action and the action of a scalar field on the hilbert space , with the rn field playing the role of a  renormalized effective theory '' ( rtt ) , which is a generalization of the well - known einstein - higgs - dirac ( eit ) formalism , originally proposed by parisi and sourlas we present a new class of random - field - theoretical models , which we call  grassmann models '' .<n> they are obtained by renormalizing an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional field theory in such a way that the resulting renormalized random field is _ locally _ dominant , _<n> i.e. _ , it is grassmannian in the sense of the grassmann - robertson - walker ( wt ) equation . in the present work ,<n> we focus on a particular class of such models that we have introduced and studied in a previous paper . <n> grassmann s model is one of the simplest and most widely studied models in statistical physics , as it is the only one able to describe a wide range of physical phenomena , from condensed matter to high - energy physics and condensed - matter systems . from a mathematical point of view , the model is simple : it is a continuum version of the well - known wt model @xcite , and it is obtained by dimensional reduction from the wt to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) field theory . as a result , in the limit of a single copy of the model  we show that a spontaneously broken dimensional reduction can occur in a random field theory if the corresponding renormalization - group ( rg ) flow is nonlinear .<n> this is achieved by assuming that the cumulants of the renormalized random field do not diverge at a finite scale , as they should , and that the lower - order proper vertices of the rg flow are always finite . in the case of a scalar field theory<n> , we also find that the breakdown of dimensional reduction requires the presence of a  cusp '' in the field dependence of the higher - order cumulants , which we call the  larkin '' scale . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- + + - + ++ + + a random - field theory is _ dimensionally reduced _ if all of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues have the same sign @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ , all 1pi vertices are zero , whereas all proper vertices are nonzero . as a result ,<n> the theory is reduced to a one - dimensional ( 1pi ) system . for a given theory , the reduced 1 we introduce a model of random - field localization , in the spirit of the parisi - sourlas approach , but with the help of a renormalization - group ( rg ) flow .<n> we show that , unlike in the original model , breakdown of dimensional reduction is not associated with the appearance of nonanalyticities in higher - order cumulants . instead , the rg flow is associated with spontaneous superrotational invariance ( susy ) breaking , which is , however , _ not _ associated with a cusp in the field dependence of the renormalized disorder . <n> random fields are ubiquitous in nature and play important roles in a wide range of phenomena . in condensed matter physics ,<n> they are ubiquitously present in superconductors@xcite , and play an important role in superfluid @xmath0he@xmath1he and in the high -

field ising model ( rfim ) with an arbitrary number of copies . here , we provide an implementation of the np - frg that allows for a check of the validity of the previous conjectures . <n> pacs numbers : 05.50.+q , 05.70.fh , 64.60.de , 75.10.hk in this paper we present a generalization of the formalism of parisi and sourlas to the case of multiple copies of the same topological insulator , in order to include susy broken breaking ( sb ) and the possibility of spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry . as a first step , @xcite we show that a minimal truncation of the renormalization group ( rg ) for the random - field ising model ( rfim ) leads to an effective description of the long - distance physics of the rfim that is compatible with susy .<n> the rg flow equations are implemented in a susy - compatible nonperturbative approximation scheme , which allows us to search for the fixed point that controls the critical behavior . at the critical point ,<n> the model is described by a  linear cusp '' . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.pb , 11.10.wx , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk 2 recently , there has been renewed interest in the problem of susy breaking in random fields.@xcite in particular , it has been suggested that susy may be spontaneously broken in a class of models called  random fermion models '' ( rfms ) . in these models<n> , the random field is assumed to be uniform and periodic in space and time , and to obey supersymmetry , more precisely superrotational invariance , in addition to being periodic in time  we study the critical behavior of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) near a zero - temperature fixed point .<n> we show that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , the flow equations for the effective average potential and the second cumulant of the renormalized random field at zero momentum can be recast in a form suitable for the description of the long - distance physics of the rfim.@xcite this allows us to obtain the running anomalous dimensions of the system , as well as the critical exponents of the @xmath1-component fermionic excitations , which are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulations . <n> _ introduction _ the study of critical phenomena in many - body systems has a long history . in condensed - matter systems ,<n> critical phenomena are usually associated with phase transitions , while in statistical mechanics they are often associated with critical phenomena that occur far from the phase boundary .. in the latter case , however , it is natural to ask whether or not there exists a universal critical behavior , and , if so , to what extent it is affected by the universality class of the underlying microscopic model . for the latter question  we study the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the square lattice by means of the running anomalous dimension method .<n> we find that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition between a normal phase and a superconducting phase . in the superconducting phase<n> , there is an infinite number of zero - temperature fixed points , each of which is characterized by a different anomalous dimension . at each fixed point ,<n> the anomalous dimension of the ground state is a function of the system s couplings to the external degrees of freedom , while the anomalous dimensions of the excited states are a function only of their energy . <n> the phase transition from a normal to a superconducting state is one of the most important and fundamental transitions in condensed matter physics . during the last decade , the study of phase transitions in superconductors has attracted a great deal of interest from both experimentalists and theorists .@xcite in particular , in the context of high - temperature superconductivity , a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out , both to understand the mechanism of the transition , and to search for new phases of this exotic state of matter . since the discovery of the critical point in the we consider the quantum statistical mechanics of a particle in a uniform magnetic field .<n> we focus on the case when the field is parallel to the particle s trajectory , i.e. , @xmath0 . in this approximation<n> , we derive a closed - form expression for the probability distribution of the energy of the particle as a function of its position in the field , which is valid for arbitrary values of the magnetic field and for any value of the coupling constant . for a particle moving in the transverse direction ,<n> the distribution is found to be a gaussian with a width depending on the sign of the field and on the direction of motion . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the statistical properties of a quantum system is one of the most important problems in modern physics , as it is closely related to many fields such as quantum computation , statistical mechanics , and high energy physics @xcite . the standard approach to the problem is the boltzmann - gibbs ( bgw ) statistics @x<n> . however , the bgw statistics breaks down in the presence of quantized fields , such as those present in quantum information theory , due to the fact that the we present a nonperturbative extension of the standard electroweak theory that provides a unified framework for supersymmetric ( susy ) field theory and the standard model ( sm ) .<n> it is based on the concept of supersymmetry breaking ( @xmath0 ) and is formulated in terms of the supersymmetry - breaking fields , the corresponding susy fields and their superpotentials , as well as the corresponding superrotations at the origin . in the framework of this theory ,<n> we show that , in addition to the usual susy breaking terms , there are also terms that arise due to non - perturbative effects beyond the standard one - loop approximation , which are manifest in the form of a non - trivial renormalization of the fields . as an application , we compute the susy contributions to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon . <n> the electroweak interactions are the origin of a large variety of phenomena in high energy physics , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs , epr , erc , becs , etc )@xcite we present a nonperturbative approach to the dynamics of superfluid helium-3 .<n> it is based on a renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the effective average action , which is solved exactly in the limit where the superfluid mass @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse uv scale . in this limit<n> , the rg equation reduces to the well - known schwinger - dyson equation ( wt ) for the one - loop superfluid density of states , and the wt relation is recovered . <n> the present approach provides a unified framework for the study of the flow of a superfluid in the presence of an external magnetic field , as in the problem of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with a quantized magnetic field in an anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometry , for example in a superconductor , or in a fluid with dynamical viscosity , such as in a liquid helium-3 ( qed ) system . for a 3d system ,<n> the flow is governed by a pair of rg equations , one of which ( eq . ( [ eq_wt_susy_ we derive the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the effective average action @xmath0 in the random - field theory of the isotropic heisenberg model in the limit of large number of particles .<n> the rg equation is nonperturbative , dimensionally reduced , and nonsingular at all scales . as an application<n> , we obtain the exact solution for the critical point of a driven isotropic bose - einstein condensate in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . <n> _ introduction _ the study of transport in isotropic quantum systems has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein , boltzmann and hawking @xcite on isotropic dirac fermions . in recent years ,<n> much progress has been made in the field of transport , both theoretically and experimentally , thanks to the development of numerical and analytical tools for the perturbative treatment of quantum many - body systems , as well as in the construction of approximate rg equations for these systems . among these tools , the riemann - hilbert ( rn ) flow equation is of particular interest , since it describes the time evolution of supersymmetry ( susy ) and weyl fermions ( wt ) are the most important symmetry - breaking mechanisms in condensed - matter physics .<n> they are often associated with the breakdown of dimensional - reduction at large scales , which is a necessary condition for the emergence of susy and wt at all scales . in this paper , we show that dimensional reduction can also be achieved in susy without wt through the superfield formalism , provided the initial conditions are chosen in such a way that the resulting susy -

log canonical_. in this note , we study the semi log canonical morphisms between two equidimensional varieties . we show that , under certain conditions , the morphism can be written as follows : [ lem : adjunction ] let @x,@xmath1 , be a finite morphism of degree between equidimensional slc and equidimensional @ we show that if @xmath0 is a double cover of a normal variety with g.d.c . base , then the hurwitz divisor of the double cover is equal to the normal variety .<n> we also extend this result to the case of general base varieties . <n> the riemann - hurwtiz formula @xcite states that if two normal varieties have a common divisor with coefficient 1 then the corresponding double divisors are identically zero . in the normal case<n> this statement is due to shokurov , and it is known since the work of thurston in the 1960 s . for the special case of a g. d.c. base<n> , it is well known that if the difference between the normal and the double varieties of the two varieties is at most 1 , so is the characteristic zero of the divisor , the corresponding divisor is lc . since this statement was only stated and proved in characteristic zero , one obtains that generically along the double locus of the normal divisor there is a hurzw divisor equal to 1 . we recall the proof of this statement in characteristic 0 and we extend it to the we introduce the notion of a hurwitz divisor for a @xmath0-cover .<n> this divisor is defined on the _ double locus _ of a cover , i.e. it does not contain any components of the double locus of the underlying base . <n> we show that if a double cover is abelian , then it is isomorphic to a _ standard _ cover . as an application<n> , we prove that a cover is _ symmetric _ iff it has a slc divisor , which is a generalization of the well -

[ ex: we consider a graph @xmath0 , which is obtained by gluing two copies of a smooth rational curve along the right hand side of a line .<n> the graph is called inertia and it is generated by the inertia subgroups of the lie algebra of real numbers , i.e. , by the integers . in this paper , we show that the set of relevant points can be described intrinsically as a set of points of the graph over which the inertia subgroup of the real numbers is zero but not d.c . <n> [ ex1 ] this paper is a continuation of the paper [ ex2 ] , where we have introduced a new graph , namely , a graph with a cokernel concentrated on a given set of singularities , and we have studied its properties . here<n> we have extended the results of [ ex3 ] and [ ex4 ] to the inertia case . we have also studied the properties of the cokernel , in particular we have proved that it can be concentrated on the singularity set of the inertia group of a surface . the main result of the present paper is that , under some assumptions , the graph obtained from the inertia graph is isomorphic to the in this note we show that the set of points @xmath0 over which the base function of the plane acts on a surface is a singly connected graph , i.e. it can be described intrinsically as a set of relevant points of the index graph of the surface obtained by gluing two curves along a smooth rational curve .<n> we also show that this graph is isomorphic to the cayley graph of @xcite . <n> this note is a continuation of our previous paper @x<n> . here we deal with the isometry problem for the base functions of two surfaces . in our previous note<n> we have shown that for any two surfaces with the property that the index function of one of them acts freely on the other one , there is a graph whose set of all relevant points is an isometry , namely it is a union of subsets of the union of lines on which the index functions of the two surfaces do not vanish . for each such graph<n> , we have a set @x , @x,@xmath1 of points such that the character of a base function on the graph is , for each point @x.2 , equal to the index of a function on @x we study the singularities of the sheaves @xmath0 induced by the covers of the rationals on the two - sphere .<n> we prove that these sheaves have no cohomology in degree 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 35 , 40 , 44 , 50 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 84 , 91 , 96 , 102 , 114 , 120 , 126 , 132 , 138 , 145 , 158 , 160 , 165 , 174 , 179 , 175 , 184 , and 198 . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite , where we studied the singularity structure of the induced covers of rationals . in this paper<n> , we investigate the singularity structure of some of the let @xmath0 be the set of all smooth , finite , non - intersecting , slc curves on the boundary of a surface @xcite .<n> we study the singularities of the _ affine _ version of this surface , i.e. , the affines of all singularities in the complement of the boundary points of the surface . as a corollary<n> , we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that the gauss map from the boundary to the interior of a riemann surface is isomorphic to the sum of two copies of a smooth rational curve . in this paper<n> we prove a generalization of this result to the case when the base of the cover is a _ sbc _ surface : the steiner - tale map from a ssc surface to a smooth tale surface is an isomorphism . <n> the construction of this paper is inspired by the work of sergey i. shabanov on _ isosurfaces of rational curves on surfaces _ ( see , for example , ref . [ sec : construction ] ) . here<n> @x we classify all surface singularities of even degree @xmath0 on an open subset of the three - dimensional torus .<n> this is done by finding all subvarieties of the hurwitz divisors in the defining equations for the surface . in the normal case<n> we find all such singularities , while in the non - normal case we find only those classified by kollr and shepherd - barron in @xcite . <n> the object of our study is the set of all _ odd _ even _ singularities over the open set of tori . here<n> we are mainly interested in the _ normal _ case , since this is the one in which we expect to find a large number of new examples , as well as to recover many known ones . for the proof<n> we use the lemma [ prop : interesting - case ] , which states that the surface @x<n> s is slc if and only if it is isomorphic to the boundary of a compact subset of a torus with boundary equal to its own . the proof is based on the fact that if we fix a point on the torus and write down the equation @x we classify all slc surface singularities over @xmath0 . in the normal case we work in the notations of kollr and shepherd - barron , while in the non - normal case they used the notation in @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction .<n> _ the _ singularities _ of a surface are the divisors that appear in the inverse image of the double curve of that surface . for a smooth surface ,<n> a _ surface singularity _ is a point - like singularity , such as the boundary of a cylinder , the edge of a plate , or the surface of a plane , that belongs to the intersection of two curves in the plane . on the other hand , for a singular surface<n> , it is possible to define an _ a priori _ probability measure on the surface such that the sum of the probabilities of the individual singularities is equal to the probability of the total surface singularity , i.e. , one is  close '' to the total , and the  far '' from the total is zero . a surface singularity is _ not _ we prove that the minimal semiresolution of the hamiltonian @xmath0 on a bounded subset of the complex projective plane is a nonsingular double curve . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a sequel to @xcite .<n> the first part of the paper is devoted to proving that , for a non - singular double curve on a compact set in the complex plane , the _ minimal _ semiresolution is a _<n> simple _ , _ smooth _ double curve if and only if the branch locus of the cover is supported on a d.c . divisor . in the second part<n> , we use this result to prove that if , in addition , there is a point of type s@xmath1 in the boundary of the unit disc such that the branch loci of the normal divisors on the boundary and on the exceptional curve of the blow up are of the same type , then there exists a nontrivial , minimal semismooth , double curve which is not a complete intersection . we prove that blow ups of the form @xmath0 have minimal semiresolutions . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the blow up of two copies of the same divisor is one of the simplest examples of an exceptional bifurcation @xcite .<n> it consists of taking a normal form along the exceptional divisor , blowing up the normal form at the non - exceptional points and taking a cover . in this paper<n> , we consider the case where the divisor has only one exceptional point , blow up the original divisor at this exceptional point and take a cover along it . for this case ,<n> we show that there is a one to one correspondence between the minimal semi resolution and the branch locus of the inverse image of the exceptional curve , which can be viewed as a generalization of the well - known one - to - one correspondence of the bifurcating divisors , see e.g. , [ s. schultz , siam j. numer . anal . *<n> 32 * ( 1992 ) , 1121 - 1148 ] . as a consequence , there are only two cases where one can recover we compute the minimal semiresolution of a blow up of a curve in the complex plane . <n> let @xmath0 be a complete intersection .<n> then there is a natural restricted cover @xxmath1 , which is defined by pulling back the normal derivative at the point of the complete intersection and normalizing along the exceptional curve . in this paper<n> , we study the blow ups of curves in the plane and compute the semiresolutions of the corresponding restricted covers . the case of a point @xcite was the first , and still is the case today , for which we have a large collection of examples of restricted covers of the plane , with a variety of interesting properties . for example , there is an infinite collection of covers that are complete intersections , so there are a large class of examples , even more than the collection of complete intersections of the real line , where there are many interesting examples . as a corollary ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that the minimal resolution of a restricted cover is equal to its inverse image , that is , the inverse of its strict transform . here<n> we present a new result for the case where the point @ we compute the minimal semiresolution of three blow ups of the laplace operator @xmath0 .<n> the blow up of the first blow up is a degenerate cusp , and the second is a double cusp . in both cases ,<n> we obtain covers that are d.c . over strict transforms of exceptional curves . <n> this paper is a continuation of @xcite[def . 4.26 ] , where we computed the semiresolutions of some blowup operators . here<n> we extend the results to the case of covers obtained by pull back and normalization of an exceptional curve . as in the previous case<n> , we obtain a semismooth resolution by the normalization algorithm . let @xmath0 be the double curve of the complex projective line group @xcite .<n> we study the singularities of the minimal semiresolution @x<n> slc , which is the minimal resolution of the set of all semiresolutions of the projective plane , and the minimal half - plane . in the case<n> when the inertia subgroup is equal to one , we show that the minimal scc semiresolution is @x , while in the reducible case it is the half - planes . <n> [ section ] [ thm]corollary [ tm]lemma [ sm]proposition [ theorem]conjecture [ theorem ] # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#1 it is well -

valued group , whose inertia group is the ( real ) inertia subgroup , let s let @xmath0 be a smooth base .<n> we study the singularities of the exceptional divisor in the base and the semiresolutions of the base , and show that they are determined by the jacobian of the branch data . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite , where we studied the base singularities . in particular , we are interested in the case where the base is reducible , i.e. , the base has no singularities in the first row and column of the preimage of the boundary divisor . here<n> we show that the base singularity problem is reduced to the study of the singularity of a certain divisor which is the  jacobi polynomial '' of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . as a corollary<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that the gauss hypergeometric function @x<n> 1$ ] is isomorphic to the _ s_-matrix of the symplectic map @x 2  $ ] , which is a generalization of the well -

perturbative problem in qcd we present analytic estimates of parton scattering rates in a thermal qgp medium using the low - temperature effective theory ( lbt ) model .<n> the analytic estimates are compared with numerical results from the lbt model and are in good agreement with each other and with lattice qcd simulations . <n> parton interactions in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are governed by the qcd phase transition temperature @xmath0 , which in turn is controlled by the baryon chemical potential in the medium @xcite . in the presence of a confining medium , the effective degrees of freedom associated with the phase transition become ambiguous and depend on the medium temperature . as a result ,<n> one has to rely on model assumptions to treat parton medium interaction . here<n> we present an approximation to the parton interaction in a static and uniform medium that is valid in the vicinity of the qgp phase transition , but which is valid for temperatures above the phase - transition temperature and for energies well below the critical one . using this approximation<n> , we can calculate the total parton - quark scattering rate as a function of the temperature in a finite baryon - chemical - potential medium and compare it with the numerical we study the parton scattering in a static and uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we show that the total scattering rate in a uniform qgp medium increases linearly with the temperature while that for a static medium increases quadratically . as a consequence ,<n> the angular distribution of the final parton in a @math1 scattering has a universal form @xcite . in the presence of a qcd phase transition , however , the final state partons are no longer localized to the ground state of the medium but diffuse out to infinity , a phenomenon that has been observed in lattice qcd simulations . <n> the scattering of thermal partons in a thermal qgp ( tqgp , hereafter referred to as qgp \" ) has been studied extensively in the literature , both in simulations and experiments . at fixed parton energies , qgp interactions are described by the relativistic boltzmann equation ( rbe ) , which in turn is derived from the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equation . for fixed values of the incident parton energy and the qgp phase transition temperature we study the energy spectra of thermal partons produced in @xmath0 scatterings in a thermal qgp medium .<n> we find that the outgoing partons have two peaks at low incident energies and an exponential fall - off with a slope as given by the temperature . in the quark - antiquark annihilation process ,<n> the outgoing gluon carries most of the incident energy and its energy spectrum has a similar structure as that of the outgoing quark in the gluon - gluon scattering . <n> qcd is the theory of strong interactions based on the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the confinement and the deconfinement phase transition of quarks and gluons in the early universe @xcite . at the present time , however , strong interactions are believed to be non - perturbative in nature , and the qcd vacuum consists of only a finite number of degrees of freedom . as a consequence , qcd has a number of unique features which make it an ideal laboratory for the study of strong -

induced medium excitation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions due to multiple parton scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we show that the energy of the thermal recoil parton in the small -

relativistic regime , where the energy density of the medium is much higher than the thermal energy density @xmath0 , the process is known as hard thermal parton ( htp ) scattering . however , in the relativistic regime where the temperature is much lower , or qgp is expected to be isotropically - dense , hard htp scattering is not expected to occur . instead , it has been multiple parton scattering in qcd is studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model , in which parton - medium scatterings are treated in the frame of hydrodynamic evolution of the quark -

parton scattering , leading to the increase of the averaged transverse momentum squared over time or the transverse - momentum broadening . according to the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> each scattering contributes to the energy - momentum density of the jet - induced medium excitation , which is proportional to the squared of the initial parton energy and the final parton momentum squared . in the lbt model , all outgoing partons , both the leading and thermal recoil partons are recorded and are allowed to go through further parton- medium scattering in the subsequent time intervals . <n> we consider all channels the leading parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in the lbt model , each parton - medium scattering contributes to the transverse momentum ( perpendicular to the initial direction of the propagating parton ) of the final leading partons according to matrix elements of the single - parton scattering .<n> the final parton spectra and energy - momentum density of the jet - induced medium excitation are studied in monte carlo simulations . <n> the transverse - momentum distribution and elastic energy loss of an energetic parton propagating in a qgp medium are studied . to take into account the back - reaction in the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> the parton is allowed to transport further according to the transport equation and to undergo additional scatterings in the subsequent time intervals . using the small - angle approximation of @xmath0 scattering , we estimate the averaged transverse momentum squared per unit length and the elastic energy lost during the propagation of an initial parton in a static qgp and compare it with the experimental data from hera . at hera<n> , the energy loss and the average transverse momentum broadening of a leading part we study the evolution of the transverse momentum distribution of an energetic parton as it undergoes multiple scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at different temperatures .<n> we show that the leading parton s final distribution is broadened due to transverse momentum transfer in the qgp medium . in the high - temperature region , where the transverse momenta of the parton and the medium partons are well separated ,<n> the distribution is gaussian and independent of the time - dependent jet transport parameter . at later times , however , the widths of the distributions increase and the distribution deviates from a gauss - like form due to multiple scattering . <n> the study of the propagation of partons in a hot and dense medium , such as a qgp ( qcd medium ) , is one of the most important topics in nuclear physics @xcite . due to the large number of scatterings that take place in such a medium<n> , it is also an important issue to understand how the partons propagate in the medium and how they acquire their final transverse momentum . to this end , one can perform simulations of multiple parton - parton scatterings using the we study the evolution of the leading parton s transverse momentum distribution in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium .<n> we show that the evolution is strongly influenced by the initial parton energy and that the energy dependence of the elastic energy loss can be understood in terms of the transverse momentum broadening of the medium partons . <n> jet quenching is one of the most important features of relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments @xcite . in the rhic regime ,<n> the energy loss of a jet is proportional to the squared transverse momentum of the incoming jet , @xmath0 , and the jet - to - jet cross section is related to the ratio of the rapidity gap of the jet to the mean - free - path of the outgoing jet . for a jet with a large transverse momentum , such as a jet produced in a central collision of heavy quarks and antiquarks , this ratio is much smaller . as a result<n> , the jet transport through a hot qgp medium can be reduced by a factor of a few compared to the case of a static medium , provided that the medium is dense and the energy of the parton we study the energy loss of gluons and quarks in a hot qcd medium using a lattice - based perturbative qcd ( lbt ) model .<n> we investigate the propagation of a gluon and a quark in a uniform and static medium with a temperature @xmath0 , and compute the averaged elastic energy loss per mean free path along the propagation path for different initial parton energies and medium temperatures . <n> qcd is a theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with strong interactions between quarks and gluons . in qcd<n> , the interaction energy between a parton and the thermal parton is proportional to the energy of the parton . as a result , in a thermal medium , partons lose their energy by scattering off thermal partons , which in turn lose energy by interacting with the medium . at high temperatures ,<n> parton - parton scatterings are strongly modified by the presence of the medium and the energy dependence of parton energy loss can be described by a small - angle approximation ( sa ) @xcite . however , at low temperatures and/or high energies , energy and momentum are conserved during each scattering , leading to multiple scattering of partons in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium can be described by a light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in this model , partons<n> are assumed to propagate with a reduced energy due to energy and momentum conservation along their path in the medium .<n> the energy loss of the leading parton is assumed to be logarithmically proportional to the energy of the initial parton in the qgp medium , while that of the negative \" parton has a power law dependence on the medium temperature . as a result of this logarithmic energy dependence , the parton s average energy loss per unit distance during multiple scattering is reduced , leading to an overall reduction of the averaged parton energy loss over a long distance . at the same time , thermal recoil partons , minus those of negative \" type , continue to lose energy and approach a thermal spectrum at later times . <n> partons with different energies and in different parts of a medium can interact with each other due to thermal excitations , and the interaction leads to parton - parton scattering , which can be studied experimentally in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc we study parton propagation and jet - induced medium excitations in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) using a light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in the lbt model , energy and momentum<n> are conserved in each parton - medium scattering .<n> the energy lost by the leading parton as shown in the above calculations will be carried by thermal recoil partons minus that of negative \" partons , in the form of jet - inducing medium partons that are also allowed to propagate and interact with the medium . to study jet propagation , we allow both of the outgoing partons in each @xmath0 scattering to propagate in the qgp medium and track them in monte carlo simulations . of the two leading partons<n> , one is the more energetic one and the other is the less energetic one . both of them are allowed to undergo further propagation and scattering in the medium and are referred to as the leading and the thermal recoil parts , respectively . the parton spectra of both leading and thermal recoil ( minus negative \" ) partons are included in the final results on jet reconstruction . <n> we find that the energy loss of the leading massless part we study the propagation of jet - induced medium partons in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium using the longitudinal boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model .<n> the energy and momentum lost to the qgp medium by the propagating parton will act like a source for the excitation of the medium parton through the propagation and transport of the jet - inducing medium partions . in the lbt model ,<n> the leading parton from each @xmath0 scattering is also allowed to further propagate and interact with the medium through the back - reaction in the transport equation . as a result<n> , we find that the energy density distributions of the excitations induced by a propagating gluon are similar to those of a propagating medium gluon with a longitudinal momentum fraction of the order of the initial one . <n> we also study the reconstruction of the parton spectrum from the energy loss and the medium excitations . for a given initial parton momentum fraction , the reconstructed parton spectra are almost independent of the incident parton s energy . however , if the initial energy fraction is larger than a threshold value , there is a significant difference between the reconstructed spectra and the unreconstructed ones we study parton propagation in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium within the framework of the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> parton interactions among jet - induced medium partons are taken into account in the lbt model in a manner consistent with the boltzmann transport equation . using monte carlo simulations ,<n> we show that the linear response of the qgp medium to jet - medium interaction leads to the formation of a shock wave in the direction of the propagating parton . <n> one of the most important and challenging problems in heavy - ion collisions is to understand the mechanism of parton energy loss in the early stage of a collision . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics<n> , the energy loss process is described by the collision of two quarks and gluons in a thermal medium . at the same time , at a hadron - hadron collider ( hhc ) , parton - induced energy loss is expected to play an important role in the hadronization process @xcite as well as in the production of hadrons of mass @xmath0 gev and above . the study of we study parton propagation in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the leading parton propagating in the qgp medium acquires transverse momentum broadening due to the interaction with the thermal medium partons . as a result ,<n> the parton accumulates a transverse momentum smearing in the direction of the source term for jet - induced medium excitation , leading to the elliptic paraboloid shape of the shock wave instead of a sharp mach - cone as predicted by the linear response theory ( lbt ) and hydrodynamic simulations . <n> partons produced in the collision of two hadrons of equal energy @xcite at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath0 gev are considered to be a probe of the properties of qcd matter at high temperatures and densities . in the early stage of a collision , the partons emitted from one of the colliding partons may freeze in a thermalized state , which is called a parton drip line ( pbl ) at low energies . at high energies , partons<n> are expected to be thermally excited in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , partons produced in the gluon - gluon fusion reaction lose a significant fraction of their energy to the subsequent propagation of a parton in the hot and dense medium created by the collision .<n> we study the angular distribution of such partons and their dependence on the initial energy of the propagating parton , the temperature of the medium , and the transverse momentum of the leading parton within the large hadron collider ( lbt ) monte carlo framework . using a modified version of the fastjet code with the anti-@xmath0 algorithm for jet reconstruction , we find that the angular distributions of the partons have azimuthal anisotropy that depends on the temperature and the initial parton energy , but not on the transverse momenta of the jet - induced medium partons . <n> the energy loss of partons in the initial stages of the collision plays an important role in understanding the mechanism of parton production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . during the early stage ,<n> partons created in the collision lose a substantial fraction ( @xmath1 ) of their initial energy to propagation in a hot , we study the effect of parton hadronization on the energy loss of a fast parton as it propagates through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium . using a monte carlo jet reconstruction algorithm that includes both leading parton and jet - induced medium partons ,<n> we show that the final hadronic jet energy loss increases linearly with time and distance of propagation .<n> we also find that the angular distribution of thermal recoil partons is modified at later times due to the diffusion of negative \" partons and transverse momentum broadening of the propagating parton . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collisions produce a highly collimated system of quarks and gluons that propagate through a hot and dense qgp medium of hadrons and anti - quarks . during the early stage of the collision , as the system is still expanding , partons undergo multiple scatterings with the thermal medium leading to parton energy loss @xcite . in the later stage , however , the partons diffuse and lose energy , which leads to the reduction of the reconstructed jet energy and the modification of the underlying hadronic background . as a result , at late times the spectrum of reconstructed jets a leading parton propagating through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium loses energy and momentum through medium parton interactions . during parton propagation ,<n> the parton interacts with medium partons , which lead to parton - medium scatterings and diffusion .<n> the energy loss of the propagating parton is reduced as it interacts with the medium , and the jet is reconstructed . in this paper , we study the jet energy loss and the transverse momentum distribution of the reconstructed jets in the light - front transverse - momentum ( @xmath0 ) and large - angle ( l@xmath1 ) approximations . <n> partons propagating in a hot and dense qgp medium experience multiple scatterings with quarks and gluons inside and outside the jet cone . at the same time , they also interact with each other and with other partons inside the jet . as a result , partons propagate through the medium and lose energy , momentum , as well as some of their initial angular and momentum<n> . some of the energy may be carried away by the partons which subsequently interact with the quarks or gluons in the medium leading to jet - induced parton excitation leading partons propagating through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium lose a significant amount of energy during their propagation through the medium . during propagation ,<n> the energetic leading parton experiences transverse momentum broadening due to interaction with medium partons .<n> the energy of the energetic parton is subtracted from both the parton distribution function and the total jet energy during the propagation . as a result , reconstructed jets contain both energetic and medium parton - induced partons inside the jet cone , but with a net transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . <n> the propagation of energetic partons through a hot and dense qgp medium has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in this study , we focus on the jet propagation and its evolution with time in a uniform medium at a constant temperature @xmath0 mev . due to the finite jet - cone size , medium partonic scatterings and diffusion<n> are expected to lead to a reduction of the jet energy and transverse momentum , as well as an enhancement of the soft parton distributions . however , the energy loss and the composition of reconstructed jets are found to be sensitive to the medium - parton interaction  we study the fragmentation of @xmath0gev propagating gluons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and baryon density .<n> we find that the momentum fraction of soft partons within reconstructed jets is enhanced as a result of parton energy loss in the qgp medium . <n> qgp is a strongly - coupled phase of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the deconfined phase of strongly - interacting quarks and gluons at high temperatures @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions ,<n> the initial state of qcd consists of a hadron gas ( hcg ) of hadrons produced in central collisions of heavy nuclei . during propagation through the hcg medium , partons<n> are rescattered to form jets which carry additional energy to the collision zone . the energy loss of partons in qgp<n> is of great interest since it can significantly modify the dynamics of the system and can lead to the formation of quark and gluon condensates ( qgcs ) in the hot and dense medium created in high - energy nuclear collisions . due to the strong coupling between gluons and quarks , the q we present a monte carlo study of parton propagation and jet transport in a qgp medium with the complete set of elastic @xmath0 scattering processes .<n> we calculated the evolution of the parton distribution function , parton energy loss , and the transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of the leading parton as it propagates through the medium . <n> partons propagating in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium carry a significant fraction of the total energy of the medium as well as a significant amount of transverse momentum . as a result ,<n> the partons of a high energy parton lose energy to the medium leading to a significant broadening of the transverse profile of the reconstructed parton ,title=\"fig ,width=321 ] + jet transport has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically in high energy heavy ion collisions.@xcite however , the lack of experimental data on jet production in qgp collisions at rhic and lhc energies has prevented from drawing conclusions on the jet structure function . in this paper<n> we present an _ ab initio _ calculation of jet structure functions in a parton model that includes all parton elastic scattering processes and the leading parton transport ( lbt ) model describes the propagation of a high energy parton in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium with the complete set of elastic parton - medium scattering processes .<n> the lbt model is based on monte carlo simulations of parton propagation in the qgp medium , including thermal recoil partons and jet - induced medium partons from the back - reaction . in this paper<n> we present the basic features of the model and its application to the phenomenological study of jet suppression in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies . <n> the study of the transport of partons in a hot and dense qcd medium has been a topic of intense research @xcite due to the possibility of observing the suppression of high energy gluons in the collision of two heavy ions at high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ) . at the lhc energy ,<n> the energy density of a 200 gev / c / nucleon proton beam is about 10 times higher than that of a proton beam of the same energy at the same center - of - mass energy and the transverse momentum of a leading part we study the suppression of leading partons and reconstructed jets in heavy - ion collisions in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . using a modified version of the jet finding package with the anti - @xmath0 algorithm in which the energy of negative \" partons from the back - reaction is subtracted , we show the effect of transport of jet - induced medium partons on reconstructed jets .<n> it is shown that the transverse momentum broadening , parton distributions ( fragmentation functions ) and transverse profiles of reconstructed jets have a power law tail underneath gaussian distributions from multiple scattering . these power law tails come from a single large angle parton - medium scattering during the jet propagation . <n> we also illustrate the dissipation of the energy and momentum lost by a propagating parton in the medium via transport of jets - inducedmedium partons ( thermal recoil partons ) in the lbt model , which effectively forms a supersonic shock wave and a diffusion wake behind the leading parton . the transport of these jet - inducing medium parton is shown to significantly reduce jet energy loss which should be taken into account for any realistic study of jet suppression in high - energy heavy - ions collisions . [ [ section ]  we calculate the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath0 of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in au+au collisions at rhic in the framework of parton energy loss model .<n> we find that the pdfs are sensitive to the shape of the initial parton impact parameter , which can be used to extract information on the early time dynamics of the collision . <n> one of the main goals of the rhic program is to search for signals of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in the search for the formation of the qgp<n> , it is important to understand how the initial state of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions of heavy nuclei is affected by the expansion of the medium , and especially by the presence of partons produced in the early stage of the collisions . to this end ,<n> a large number of theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out , using a variety of approaches , such as lattice qcd , hadronization models , hydrodynamics and transport models . as a result , a number of important and important results have been obtained  we present the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev measured by the star collaboration at rhic .<n> the spectra are calculated in the framework of the parton cascade model using the monte - carlo event generator event generator pythia . <n> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the collision of heavy ions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic)@xcite is an ideal environment for studying the properties of strongly interacting matter @xcite . in particular , the bulk properties of the qgp such as equation of state ( eos ) , chemical composition , freeze - out temperature , etc . have been extensively studied in order to understand the formation of the hot and dense qgp created at the rhic energy density . however , very little is known about the collective behavior of the matter created at high energy density due to the lack of precise measurements of the multiplicity spectra of the emitted particles . on the other hand , such measurements are essential for the understanding of the early stage of the evolution of the system created in a heavy - ion collision , which is characterized by a high we present a calculation of the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution of pions and kaons produced in pb - pb collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> the calculation is based on the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) for the pion and kaon , the ria+@xmath1 model for the nucleon , and the urqmd transport approach for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium . <n> the study of the properties of the hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) is an important task in nuclear physics . in particular , it is crucial to understand the role played by the medium in the collision process , in particular in the vicinity of the phase transition from a hadron - dominated to a hadronic - dominated regime @xcite . at rhic energies ,<n> the system is expected to evolve through a deconfined phase , which is characterized by a high density of matter and a low temperature , where the transition from the hadron phase to the qgp phase can be first order . as a result , a large we study the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 ratio in pb+pb collisions at the lhc energies .<n> we find that the rapidity and energy dependence of this ratio can be well described by a qcd - inspired effective lagrangian . <n> recently , the leps collaboration reported the first data on the transverse momenta and rapidities of charged hadrons , produced at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in their analysis , they used a parton cascade model for the description of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which are based on the relativistic quark model ( rqm ) of qcd . to describe the experimental data , a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculation was performed using the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @x<n> . however , this calculation does not take into account the initial - state radiation ( isr ) and thus does not reproduce the experimental results . on the other hand , in a recent letter ,<n> the same authors have presented a model - independent analysis of the same data using the wilsonian",

plasma interactions , among others . among these ,<n> one of the most important is laser - induced particle emission , also known as laser - assisted radiative transfer ( laser - irt ) , where a laser is used we study interference effects in bremsstrahlung from a composite target to a thin layer of amorphous material .<n> we compare two different averaging procedures and propose two recipes for incorporating coulomb corrections , which give a reasonable balance between precision and simplicity for the addressed case . <n> pacs : 41.60.-m , 42.25.bs , 42.65.sf , 02.30.zz interference effects are ubiquitous in electromagnetic scattering . in the simplest case of a single scattering foil ,<n> they are due to the interference between the initial and final electron lines , as well as between the radiation and the intervening medium @xcite . as a consequence , in the limit of a large - angle scattering , the interference is described by the lorentz - invariant amplitude @xmath0 , and the interference spectrum is given by the well - known gaussian formula . for a composite medium , on the other hand , this amplitude is modified by interference effects , such as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , or the anti - lpm effect ( a - lm ) , depending on the nature of we derive the large - angle asymptotics of dipole radiation spectrum in a geometrically thin layer of substance in the range of @xmath0 . in the simplest approximation ,<n> the asymptotics are given by a series expansion in terms of the scattering angles in the target .<n> we show that this result can be derived from that of blankenbecler and drell [ _ phys . rev . <n> a _ * 58 * , 4833 ( 1999 ) ] , provided the target thickness is much smaller than the photon formation length . as an example<n> , we apply the result to the case of gold and carbon targets , and derive the spectrum in the thin - layer limit . *<n> introduction : * in a recent paper @xcite , a generalization of the drell s dipole - radiation approximation has been derived for the case when the target is thin enough that the radiation is emitted over a wide range of scattering angles . the approximation is based on the dipole approximation for dipole radiation ( see , e.g. , eq . a )<n> . however , it does not take into account the inter - jet region between the initial and multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) is studied in the limit of geometrically thin targets .<n> it is shown that the mcs spectrum is determined by a two - term asymptotic expansion in terms of the scattering angles in the target . in the thin - target limit , this expansion<n> is found to be identical to that derived by blankenbecler and drell [ eq . <n> ( 30 ) ] in the case of gaussian scattering , but it differs from it by a coefficient that depends on the radiation intensity . as a result of this discrepancy ,<n> the dependence of the mc spectrum on radiation intensity is not the same as that of the rossi formula , which , in turn , depends on target thickness . for sufficiently high radiation intensity<n> , however , the coefficient of the expansion converges to that of rossi s formula . at low radiation intensities , on the other hand , there are two distinct regimes : one in which the spectrum is independent of radiation intensity and the other in which it is dependent on the target thickness and the radiation field . the two regimes are separated by a first - order phase transition , where the spectrum changes from the multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) in laser - plasma interactions is studied for thin and thick targets .<n> it is shown that for thin targets , the mcs can be accurately described in terms of a double - time integral . for thick targets<n> , however , this integral can not be evaluated exactly , as it deviates from the exact result by a factor of 2 . in this letter , we present an accurate evaluation of the differential cross - section of single and multiple coulombic scattering for thin plasmas , based on an exact integral representation [ see , e.g. , refs . <n> @xcite ] . as a result ,<n> we find that for a thin target ( @xmath0 ) , in addition to the well - known rossi s radiation length , one also needs to take into account a radiation length of the order of the radiation wavelength , which is of the same order of magnitude as the radiation length in the non - thin limit . to illustrate the generality of our approach , some numerical results<n> are presented for plasmas of various thicknesses , including plasmas with a single thin target . we calculate the radiation spectrum of an electron scattered by a thin target of arbitrary thickness in the low-@xmath0 approximation , where @xmath1 is the energy of the incident photon .<n> the results are in agreement with those obtained recently by baier and katkov [ phys . rev . <n> lett . * 84 * , 3292 ( 2000 ) ] , but differ from them in the extreme thin target limit , when the distribution in scattering angles deviates significantly from a gaussian , and the differential cross - section of single scattering turns out to be a factor of two smaller than obtained by them . as a result ,<n> the energy spectrum is a non - monotonic function of the scattering angle , with the maximum at a nonzero angle of incidence . in the case of thin targets<n> , it is well known that the spectrum of emission of a photon with energy @xcite is determined by its impact parameter relative to the parent electron , which depends on the thickness of the target and on the angle between the scattering plane and the propagation direction of the emitted photon ( see e.g. , ref . and the references therein ) we propose a method for calculating the probability of emission of a photon with energy @xmath0 from an atom or molecule , that is , from the angle of scattering .<n> the method is based on evaluation of the photon s impact parameter relative to the atomic or molecule axis , and takes into account the full atomic - to - photon wave function . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of photon emission from lithium hydride ( lih ) atoms . <n> it is well - known that the angular distribution of the scattered photon is affected by the atomic line - shape @xcite . in particular , the angle between the incident photon and the line - of - sight is modified , as a result of the atomic motion . for an atom ,<n> this effect is well known as the  atomic shift '' , or angular broadening . on the other hand , for a molecule <n> : the electron s angular distribution is modified too , since it is subject to atomic motion as well . the atomic shift can be calculated as a function of the scattering angle , with the value depending on the intensity of the radiation . in this paper , we present a new approach to calculation of the atomic bremsstrahlung cross - section , based on the comparison of the results for scattering on a single atom with the ones obtained by using the widely used empirical formula - dependence of the coefficient .<n> we show that the latter overestimates the actual value of the scattering by a factor @xmath0 , so it can not be used to determine the precise value of atomic screening radius , that is crucial for accurate estimation of the radiation length . <n> _ introduction _ the aim of the present paper is to present a simple approach to estimation of atomic scattering cross - sections based on comparison of theoretical predictions with the data obtained from experiments . to do so ,<n> we first consider the problem of determining the scattering amplitude from the data for ionization and excitation of an atomic system by radiation , and then derive a formula for the amplitude in terms of the rms scattering angle . in the spirit of glauber s approach @xcite<n> , it will be shown to be equivalent to the formula for gaussian average of scattering on one atom , with the atomic scattering radius playing the role of the impact parameter . as a result  we present a method for calculating the rms scattering angle in multiple - scattering experiments .<n> the method is based on averaging over azimuths of the scattering angle distribution function , and is valid for arbitrary number of scattering plates . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of coulomb blockade experiments on gold and carbon . <n> the scattering of particles off solid surfaces is of fundamental importance in astrophysics , chemistry , physics of matter , as well as in atomic and molecular physics @xcite . in these experiments ,<n> the particles are accelerated , deflected , or decelerated by means of a dispersive or diffusive medium , which , in turn , scatters them off the solid surface . for the description of the collision of two such objects , the scattering process is often referred to as bremsstrahlung ( bs ) : @xmath0 where the electron is treated as a free particle and the ion as a charged particle . from the theoretical point of view , it is well - known that bs is a non - perturbative process , since it involves the transfer of energy from one particle to another @x we calculate the angular distribution function @xmath0 of coulomb - induced multiple scattering in a double quantum dot .<n> we find that it is identical to the one obtained by baier and katkov [ j. phys . <n> a : math . theor . * 41 * , 413 ( 1993 ) ] for the single dot , but that it has a different form for the two dots : it has two contributions , one of which is proportional to the scattering angle of each dot and the other is a non - trivial correction that depends on the number of scattering sites . in the limit of large scattering angles ,<n> the two - dot distribution function agrees with that of the single - dot case , while at small scattering angles the single- and double - dot distributions differ qualitatively . for a two - dimensional system , we show that the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude is governed by a single parameter , which can be estimated by averaging over the scattering angles of the two plates , as is done in the case of a single - quantum - dot scattering experiment . recently , there has been considerable interest in the physics of multiple scattering ( ms ) @xcite we propose a method to measure the angular distribution of the electromagnetic field generated by a laser - driven electron beam .<n> the method is based on averaging over scattering angles in an azimuthally symmetric way . as an example<n> , we apply the method to estimate the quadrupole - to - octupole photon conversion efficiency of an electron beam driven by a strong laser pulse . <n> the generation of coherent electromagnetic radiation from a laser pulse is a ubiquitous process in physics , chemistry , and biology @xcite . in the linear regime ,<n> the intensity of the laser field is proportional to the square root of the cross section of the scattering process , @xmath0 . for weak laser fields , where the cross sections of the two processes are comparable , this relation is well - known as the landauer - bttiker relation ( lbr ) @x<n> . however , the lbr does not take into account the nonadiabatic nature of the photon emission , which makes it difficult to measure its angular distribution in the presence of nonadiabaticity . on the other hand , in the nonlinear regime of strong laser - plasma interactions , as is the case in we study the electromagnetic response of a double quantum dot coupled to two metallic leads .<n> the dot is assumed to be weakly coupled to the leads , and the current - voltage characteristics are calculated by means of the bogoliubov - de gennes and the non - equilibrium green s functions methods . in the weak - coupling regime ,<n> the current is dominated by the quadrupole component of the dot s electromagnetic field , whereas in the strong - coupling limit , the electric field of the leads is the dominant contribution . as a result , in addition to the radiation from the dot half - line , this field is also responsible for oscillations of the bremsstrahlung radiation spectrum . <n> quantum dots ( qds ) are one of the most promising platforms for the exploration of fundamental aspects of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , such as the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite , as well as for applications in quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite and quantum metrology ( qmt ) ( see , _<n> e.g. _ , refs . [ eqs : cond - mat ] we study the effect of plasmonic resonances ( pdrs ) on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a double - plate geometry .<n> we show that the pdr enhancement of the bremsstrahlung spectrum , which is due to the interaction between plasmons in the two plates , can be understood in terms of interference effects between the plasmic modes . in particular , we demonstrate that , in contrast to the case of a single plate , pdr - enhanced scattering can lead to an oscillatory behavior of the spectrum . <n> electromagnetic waves are ubiquitous in nature and technology . as a consequence ,<n> the study of their propagation properties has been the subject of intense research efforts in the last decades @xcite . among these , the propagation and scattering of light are among the most important issues in modern physics , since they are involved in the formation and characterization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as well as in the observation of gravitational waves in the earth s atmosphere . despite the importance of these issues , they are still poorly understood , especially in the light of the recent progress in the development of quantum - mechanical theories of light propagation we study the interference of electromagnetic radiation emitted by two parallel plates separated by a finite distance .<n> it is shown that the maximum in the spectral distribution of the radiation is shifted by zero wavelength shift when the distance between the plates equals an integer number of coherence lengths , independently of shapes of the distribution function . in the case when the wavelength shift is zero , the maximum is shifted again by a factor proportional to @xmath0 . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of interference effects in optical waveguides has a long history , going back to the work of bennett and brassard in the 19th century @xcite . since then , it has become an active area of research , with applications ranging from cavity optics to quantum information processing , and from cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) to kerr - based quantum control . for the latter case ,<n> the main interest has been focused on the so - called lpm effect , i.e. , interference between two beams of radiation emitted at different wavelengths , which has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically . on the other hand , in the context of quantum optics<n> , one of the most important we derive the quadrupole radiation spectrum of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical lattice in the limit of strong in - medium coupling .<n> the main result is a closed expression for the spectral function @xmath0 , which is valid for any orientation of the optical axis , provided that the transverse dimension of the system is sufficiently large . in this limit<n> , the spectrum of 2d bec can be expressed as a sum of two contributions , one arising from the interaction of the condensate with the lattice , and the other originating from the condensate s interaction with the medium . <n> pacs numbers : : 42.50.ct , 42.65.hw , 78.20.ci , 03.75.lm quantum effects in condensed matter systems have attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . among them<n> is the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) of ultracold atoms in optical lattices , for which a number of theoretical and experimental results have been reported in the last few years . for the description of the qed in a 2d geometry ,<n> the bec is usually we derive a green s function expansion for the quadrupole radiation spectrum of a spherically symmetric fluid .<n> the result is equivalent to the expansion of @xcite , which is based on a non - linear schrdinger equation on the light front . in the limit of large impact parameter<n> , it reduces to the well - known expression of the gaussian approximation . at small impact parameter ,<n> our expansion is equivalent in form to that of the recently proposed expansion of ( [ f - aver - series - av - chi - a ] ) . <n> [ [ introduction .] ] introduction. + + +<n> + + / introduction.+ + + _ introduction.- _<n> the aim of this paper is to derive an analytic approximation for the radiation spectrum @xmath0 of a fluid with spherical symmetry . to this end , we derive an expansion in terms of green _ s _ functions of the form [ eqs .

einstein condensation of condensed matter , ultracold atoms , atomic magnetic resonance ( amr ) spectroscopy , we derive a general formula for the visibility of the low-@xmath0 dip in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a plate of arbitrary thickness .<n> the formula is valid for both gaussian and molire averaging , and for arbitrary values of the visibilities of gross features of the spectrum , provided that the thickness of the plate is small compared to the inverse of the scattering angle , @xmath1 . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , we consider the propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) radiation from an arbitrary plate of finite thickness , in the regime of strong scattering at two plates separated by a finite distance . in this regime ,<n> the spectrum is usually referred to as the _ visibility spectrum _ , since the interference between two plates of different thickness leads to a _ dip _ in the visibility spectrum @xcite . here<n> , the term  visibility '' is used to refer to the fact that , even in the absence of scattering at any of the plates , a dip may still be observed in the spectral distribution of the emitted radiation , as it is in the case of optics , where the visibility is defined as the ratio we present a theory of the radiation spectrum in the vicinity of strongly scattering foils , in the limit of small @xmath0 .<n> it is based on a generalization of the blankenbecler - drell theory , which is valid in the region of large radiation intensity , but which neglects the interference between dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole radiation . as an example<n> , we apply the theory to the case of a single plate of aggregate thickness . <n> pacs numbers : 41.60.ap , 41.75.ht , 42.65.sf , 02.70.uu in the past few years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of the spectrum of radiation near strongly scattering ( css ) objects , such as mirrors , mirrors with high refractive index , carbon nanotubes , etc . @xcite . in particular , it has been realized that in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields , the spectra of these objects may exhibit pronounced dips in the frequency at a certain frequency , called the visibility , below which no radiation is emitted , and above which there is no visibility at all . at the same time  we calculate the visibility of interference fringes in electromagnetic radiation from two metallic foils separated by a distance @xmath0 , in the region of large photon energies .<n> we show that the account of fluctuations of scattering leads to a lowering of the visibility in the large-@xmath0-region , whereas the neglect of fluctuations leads to an increase . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , we consider two - dimensional electromagnetic ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) wavefronts in the presence of two metallic ( silver and gold ) foils of different thicknesses , separated by an angle of a few degrees . in the first case ,<n> we consider the case when both foils are metallic , and in the second case when one of them is metallic . for simplicity<n> we assume that one of the foils is metallic and the other is semiconducting , while the other one is semi - conducting , but we do not make any assumption on the structure of the fermi surface , nor on the properties of fermi - dirac sea . we calculate spectral shapes of electromagnetic radiation in both cases , for arbitrary values of the separation between the two foils @x we study the effect of fluctuations of scattering on the interference fringes of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a pair of two - dimensional ( 2d ) foils .<n> we show that the interference effect is strongly suppressed in the large-@xmath0 region , where fluctuations tend to suppress the radiation . in this region<n> , the interference function has a maximum at @xmath1 , which is achieved by the molire distribution . <n> the interference of photons emitted by two 2d foils is one of the most studied problems in quantum optics @xcite , and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years ( see , _<n> e.g. _ , refs.@xcite and references therein ) . at present , there are two main approaches to study this effect , both based on perturbative methods : ( i ) the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) theory , developed in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the strong coupling regime ; and ( ii ) perturbation theory in qed in the limit of strong coupling , when the photon scattering amplitude is small . we study the optical properties of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in the regime of strong electron - electron interactions .<n> we show that , in contrast to the case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , the visibility of the spectral fringes is not determined by the density of states at the fermi energy , but by the spectral density at the energy of the first excited state . as a result ,<n> the recently proposed baier - katkov s function @xcite is not valid in this regime . <n> _ introduction. _ in this paper , we consider the dynamics of electrons in 2d optical lattices , which are formed by two identical slabs of aluminum foils separated by a distance @xmath0 . in the absence of an external magnetic field<n> , these 2d systems can be regarded as 1d systems with a single band of non - interacting electrons . for strong enough interactions , this single - band picture breaks down , leading to the so - called double - band scenario , i.e. , to the presence of two energy bands separated by an energy gap of the order of a few ev . at the same time  we derive an exact expression for the interference function in the case of double small - angle scattering of electrons from two identical metallic foils separated by a distance @xmath0 .<n> we show that this function is proportional to the squared scattering strength , and that it is completely determined by the angle between the two foils . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of electron - electron scattering in a double scattering potential has been considered for a long time @xcite . in the original formulation ,<n> the potential was written in terms of the scattering strengths of the two parts of the system , which were assumed to be small compared to each other , in order to minimize the influence of the potential on the electron wave function . since then , the problem has been reformulated in the form of a scattering theory of two interacting particles , with the interaction potential taken to be the sum of two terms , one of which is the amplitude of the wave function and the other one is the scattering strength of the whole system . as a result of this reformulation<n> , it was found that the two - particle problem can be reduced to a one - particle one , namely , that of two scattering channels . we present a general theory of bremsstrahlung from thin metallic plates , which takes into account the finite thickness of both targets and the random nature of the scattering medium .<n> we apply it to the case of two plates separated by a distance @xmath0 equal to the scattering strength between them , and compare our results with those of baier - katkov and zakharov [ phys . <n> . lett . * 78 * , 2304 ( 1993 ) ] . in the case<n> when the scattering between the plates is weak , we find that the visibilities in the vicinity of the intersection of spectral minima and maxima obey the bethe - heitler law . for stronger scattering ,<n> however , the visibility approaches a saturation - free value , as in the conventional case of scattering from a random medium , provided the medium is sufficiently thin . as a result , in contrast to the latter case , our theory predicts a growing inaccuracy of the predictions of blankenbecler and drell for the visibility of secondary maxima and minima , when the foil thickness increases from the thin - plate limit to a few micrometers , in this paper , we present a theoretical study of two - target bremsstrahlung in gold foils , with the aim to clarify the role of nearest scatterings in the visibility of radiation minima and maxima .<n> it turns out that the visibility depends not only on the mean interatomic distance , but also on the thickness of the scattering foil . as a result ,<n> the visibility increases with the thickness , whereas the shape of spectral oscillations remains the same . <n> it is well - known that nearest - scattering effects play an important role in the spectrum of radiation emitted by ultracold atomic gases @xcite . in particular , they are responsible for the so - called lpm effect , i.e. , the oscillatory shape of the radiation spectrum with the increase of scattering strength @xmath0 , and for the suppression of radiation in the vicinity of the first scattering , as was first discovered by baier - katkov and zakharov in the early 1970s . since then , there has been a growing interest in the study of lpm effects , mainly due to the fact that they play a central role in various fields of physics , such as ultracold the lpm suppression of bremsstrahlung at lowest @xmath0 is known to be accompanied by an enhancement , which can be called the anti - lpm effect .<n> the latter effect may be associated with an inclined - half - wavelength resonance , but not with the unit wavelength resonance as was previously suggested . in this paper , we show that the two effects are essentially of the same origin , and that their relative strength is determined by the interatomic distance . for a macroscopic and fixed separation between the scatterers , lpm - like suppression is accompanied by adjacent enhancement . the shape of radiation - angle - integral spectra is shown to depend non - trivially on the two separations . as a result ,<n> the suppression of lpm at low energy is suppressed by a factor proportional to the square of the separation , whereas the enhancement at higher energy is enhanced by a similar factor . <n> it has been known for a long time that lpm ( light particle magneto - interaction ) suppression at low energies is suppressed , in general , by an effect known as lpm enhancement @xcite . according to migdal , the suppression is due to a combination of two effects  we study the lpm - like and anti - lpm effects on bremsstrahlung in random and weakly scattering media .<n> we find that the former effect is accompanied by an enhancement , which can be called the anti - larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( lpm ) effect . in classical electrodynamics , lpm and<n> anti - mpm effects are predicted to have equal strength , in the sense that their @xmath0-integrated effect is zero . for scattering foils with macroscopic and fixed separation ,<n> the l pm - like suppression of the interference term at low scattering angles in the unit - wavelength region , as predicted by migdal [ phys . <n> . lett . * 94 * , 023601 ( 2005 ) ] , is accompanied ( but not accompanied ) by an adjacent enhancement . the latter effect may be associated with an inclined - half - wavelength resonance , but not with the unit wavelength resonance as in @xcite . we establish that if the rms scattering angle is calculated with a proper account of coulomb corrections , the predictions of gaussian averaging are pretty close to those we present a theory of interference effects in radiation emitted by a relativistically - moving projectile .<n> the projectile is assumed to be composed of two plates , one of which scatters relativistically , and the other scatters linearly . in the limit of large @xmath0 , the interference pattern in the spectrum<n> is shown to be described by the classical electrodynamics , provided one accounts for coulomb corrections to the rms scattering angle . <n> [ [ section ] ] the idea of observing interference effects due to the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter has been around for a long time , going back to beheisenberg @xcite , but it was only recently that the possibility of observing such effects was raised for the first time in an experiment , performed by baier and katkov @x<n> . one of the most striking manifestations of interference is the so - called _ anti - lpm effect _ , in which the interference maxima and minima are shifted in phase with respect to the direction of propagation of the incident radiation , as a result of the linearity of the interaction between the projectile and the matter . since this effect was first discussed by oscill @ it is shown that the anti - longitudinal phase - shift ( anti - lpm ) effect may be observed in the radiation emitted by a charged particle moving in a periodic potential .<n> the possibility of observing the effect is illustrated by considering the motion of an electron in a cylindrically symmetric potential , which is assumed to be generated by a circularly symmetric gaussian wave with a period of @xmath0 ms . in the limit of a large potential<n> , it is found that the rms scattering angle of the electron increases with the distance from the center of the wave , in agreement with rossi s model . as a result ,<n> the intensity of the emitted radiation is reduced , as compared to that of the lpm effect for the same potential strength . <n> _ introduction _ in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the possibility to observe the effect of anti - linear phase - shifts ( alps ) in radiation from charged particles moving in periodic potentials ( pmp ) @xcite . for instance , the effect was first observed in astrophysical plasmas , where it was suggested to use the analogy between the pmp effect in radiation and the",

the interaction rates are the only free parameters of the model . here<n> we summarize the state - of - the - art of dynamical models for networks of this type , focusing on four classes of models : _ networks fmie processes are branching processes in which an agent holds a token whose rate is determined by the geometry of the underlying graph .<n> we discuss two such processes , one associated with the two - dimensional lattice , and the other with points in the three - dimensional plane . <n> let @xmath0 be the population size of a point in the two dimensional lattice at time _ year _ 2005 . in this paper , we consider the following process : starting with the complete graph , add rates for non - adjacent points . we will see that the associated markov chain with transition rates @xcite , which we call the _ associated _ fmie process , has a number of interesting properties : ( 1 ) the token is distributed uniformly on the lattice ; ( 2 ) it has a non - zero probability of being deleted ; and ( 3 ) when the token reaches a critical size , the probability of deletion goes to zero as the lattice size tends to infinity . for the associated fmie ,<n> we show that the distribution of the token size converges to that of the gaussian process on the torus . as a corollary<n> , it follows that we consider the galton - watson branching process with @xmath0 agents , where each agent holds a token .<n> there is a continuous - time markov chain associated with the underlying geometry , which we call the associated markov chains . <n> the population size process is defined as the ratio of the time until the meeting between the agent holding the token and the agent who has held the token previously . in the case where the infection is transmitted from one agent to the other ,<n> the associated process is called the _ infection - transmission process _ , and its transition rates are @xxmath1 . for the general case , we show that the probability that the infection spreads to all the other agents is given by the integral of the probability of the infection with respect to the associated chain , up to a logarithmic factor . as a consequence , <n> we obtain the first known upper bound on the rate of spreading in the presence of infection in the 2-state fmie model . the proof is based on an analysis of the lyapunov exponents of the associated chains , as well as a study of the asymptotic distribution of the number of infected agents as a function of the ratio @x the first passage percolation ( fpp ) model is a variant of the well - known galton - watson tree model , in which two agents are initially infected , and when an infected agent meets another one , the other agent becomes infected .<n> the model has a number of analogies with the voter model and the averaging process , but in contrast with these , it assumes i.i.d . <n> distances @xmath0 between any pair of agents . in this paper<n> , i will show how the theory of finite chains can be used to understand the behavior of the model . as an example , for a fixed initial infection time ,<n> i show that the stationary distribution of the fpp model is the same as that of the associated markov chain , as long as there is an induced distance between any two of the agents , which is a feature absent in the corresponding fmie model with only one infected agent . *<n> introduction : * in a series of papers @xcite , galton and watson introduced a tree - like model of  infected agents '' with the following properties : 1 ) initially one agent is infected ; 2 ) every the first passage percolation ( fpp ) model is a natural model for the spread of information in a real - world epidemics process .<n> it is based on the observation that in a fpp model , there is an induced distance ( @xmath0 ) between any pair of agents . in this paper<n> , i give a characterization of the time - asymptotic behavior of the model in terms of absorption , interchange , and  disordered '' configurations . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] consider the fmie process over the complete graph on @xmath0 agents defined by a deterministic update function .<n> we show that there are four qualitatively different possible time - asymptotic behaviors : absorption in a random one ( of a small number of agents )  ordered '' configurations , voter s law , convergence to the unique stationary distribution , and a  gambler s dilemma '' . <n> [ sec : wlln ] there are several other fmies can be  built over '' the pandemic model . but it differs it seems no existing  general theory .

[ p : duality ] in the case of reversible chains ( rts )<n> , @x we study the averaging process in a social dynamics model where the agents interact via a markov chain .<n> we show that the process converges to a limit which we define as the log - sobolev constant of the associated model . <n> [ p : adual ] for the averaging model @xmath0 with arbitrary initial configuration , we give an explicit formula for the rate of convergence , in terms of the entropy of the configuration . as an application<n> we derive a duality relation between the averaging and the associated markov chains , and show that in the case where the initial configuration is a probability distribution over agents , the resulting averaging process is asymptotically equal to the corresponding markov process . in the process ,<n> the entropy is given by @xcite , where it is defined as the difference between the sum of the densities of the initial and final configurations . for the case<n> where the configuration is the uniform distribution , it is shown that the average over all configurations is equal to a product of the rates of two other processes , one of which is the averaging , while the other is the markov , thus establishing a connection between the two processes . *<n> introduction : * we present a markov chain model of opinion - changing processes . in this model<n> agents interact via a local interaction mediated by a markovian dynamics .<n> the model is exactly solvable and provides an example of a non - equilibrium , non - linear dynamical system . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + - + + _ _ + + the subject of opinion dynamics has seen dramatic progress in the last few years @xcite . despite this progress , many open problems remain , including understanding the mechanisms by which information is exchanged between agents , how this exchange is affected by the presence of noise in the system , and how the dynamics of the system is influenced by the nature of the interactions between the agents . to address these issues ,<n> there has been a lot of work done on opinion dynamics , both in the theory itself as well as in the application to control and simulation of systems . a popular approach to opinion dynamics is to consider it as a model of dynamical systems , in which agents interact with each other via some kind of markov process ( see , e.g. , the introduction of the term  dynamical '' in the definition of the theory  we consider the opinion dynamics of a finite number of agents @xmath0 , each of which has a different opinion @xcite , interacting via a random interaction with their neighbors .<n> this model has been studied extensively , both in the finite and infinite lattice settings . in the infinite lattice case<n> , it has been shown that the dynamics of this model are completely determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of the system . for the finite - agent case ,<n> however , no complete description of the dynamics has been given . <n> the purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of a general opinion dynamics for a finite set of agents , and to give a complete characterization of all possible forms of interactions between the agents . we consider the opinion dynamics of a finite - agent model of opinion formation , where opinions are generated by agents interacting with their neighbors . in this model<n> , each agent can create up to @xmath0 different opinions , and each opinion can be  absorbed '' in an ordered configuration of agents .<n> we study the dynamics of this model , both analytically and numerically . <n> in particular , we prove that the consensus time ( the time it takes for all the opinions to be in one of the ordered configurations ) is polynomial in the size of the system . we also show that this consensus time can be expressed as a linear function of the number of opinions . as a consequence ,<n> we derive polynomial - time upper and lower bounds for the consensus times in the general case . we introduce a process of multiple opinions , which can be viewed as a generalization of the binary consensus process .<n> we show that the number of different opinions that can be reached in a time @xmath0 grows logarithmically with the size of the set of opinions . as a consequence<n> , the process has a finite lifetime . <n> the concept of a consensus process was introduced by anderson @xcite , in his celebrated work on the statistical mechanics of games . in the context of that work ,<n> the consensus process is defined as the minimum number of opinions that a finite number of players must have in order to guarantee a certain stationary distribution of outcomes , and is defined in terms of a stochastic process in which all possible configurations are allowed to change with time . since the concept was introduced , it has found numerous interesting applications in a variety of fields , including probability theory , probability and statistics , computer science , social sciences , economics , political science and many others . for a review , see , for example , refs . and references therein . here<n> we focus on the process of @x  everyone has the same opinion '' , or fmie process we propose a new stochastic model of the discrete logarithm of the number of agents in a multi - agent system .<n> the model is based on the concept of the _ tokenization process _ : initially each agent has a collection ( cluster ) of tokens . at time @xmath0 each agent gives his tokens to the other agents . <n> tokenization is a stochastic process in which agents interact by exchanging their tokens with the help of a distributed random number generator . in the case of multi - agents systems ,<n> this number generator is a random variable , which can be expressed in the form of a markov chain , a gaussian , or a poisson process , depending on the characteristics of the token distribution . as an example<n> , we consider the case where agents interact with each other only through the exchange of their tokens , i.e. , the so - called _ discrete logarithm _ ( d@xmath1 ) . for this model<n> we derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of the total number of tokens exchanged between two agents , for arbitrary initial conditions , and show that the distribution depends on the underlying dynamics of the system only through we consider a stochastic cellular automaton , where agents interact via a cellular automata network ( cnn ) .<n> each agent can communicate with up to @xmath0 other agents in the network , and the automaton can respond to each of these agents by sending a message back to the agent in its neighborhood . we show that the automaton converges to a stationary state , which is characterized by a probability density function ( pdf ) of the time elapsed since the last exchange of the communication between the agents . in the limit of infinite communication distance ,<n> the pdf converges as @xcite . <n> we present a simple model for the time evolution of the pdf and we prove that the convergence rate is given by the log - normal distribution . as a consequence<n> , we obtain a lower bound on the number of communication attempts needed to completely annihilate the automaton . finally , the convergence to the stationary state is studied in the case where the communication network is asymmetric , i.e. , agents communicate with each other via an asymmetric cellular network . for this purpose<n> we introduce a new class of asymmetric cellular automatons , called asymmetric multi - agent automata ( ama ) for short . in the finite voter model @xcite , each voter interacts with @xmath0 neighbors in a square lattice , and each member of each lattice particle interacts with the other neighbors in the same lattice .<n> the dynamics of the model is described by a set of independent markov chains , which are allowed to move at half - speed , move independently until two particles meet and thereby coalesce . in this paper , i study the behavior of the coalescence time as a function of the rate of change of the associated markov chain , as well as of the number of neighbors of a given particle . <n> i first show that for a symmetric rate of increase of the markov rate , there is a critical value of the coupling constant @x , such that the coalescing chains process converges to the voter model as the coupling is increased . for a rate of decrease ,<n> there is no such critical value ; instead , the coalescent time scales as the square root of the increase in the rate . as a consequence , for a fixed rate of reduction of the rates of change , one can define a finite - time measure on the set of all particles , called the _<n> in this note , i give a short survey of recent work on the finite voter model .<n> i also discuss some open problems . <n> the voter model @xcite is a simple model of a population of individuals , of which there are @xmath0 choices at each point in time , and each chooses one of these two choices at a time . in this model ,<n> the individual s actions ( opinions ) influence the outcome of the election , which is decided by the combined action of the population at each time instant . for a complete graph @xxmath1 of individuals<n> , there is a markov chain of states that evolves as the population evolves , with rates that scale with the number of individuals in the chain . at each instant , each individual decides one of its two opinions by making a decision in the direction of the other s opinion . the mean hitting time to a state<n> is called the _ coalescence time _ of the markov chains , defined here as the time until the entire chain of chains coalesces to form a single particle . from the perspective of statistical physics , this is the simplest non - trivial example of a non - equilibrium process we provide bounds on the average hitting time and the average absorption time of a markov process on the @xmath0-dimensional voter model .<n> these results apply to a wide range of voter models , ranging from simple rw to more complex voter models with multiple opinions . <n> markov processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , computer science , and biology . in particular , they play an important role in dna recombination , quorum sensing , gene regulation , protein folding , dna replication , as well as in the dynamics of bacterial motility @xcite . as a result of these processes<n> , there has been much recent interest in the time it takes a process to move from one state to another , or to change from a state to the next , on a stochastic process . for example , it has been shown that the time to change a state in a dna - recombination model can be bounded by a function of that state s recombination rate , provided the recombination rate is sufficiently small . on the other hand ,<n> it is not known how fast a process can move on a weighted graph , nor how fast it can change in time on the complete graph  in this note , i give a short overview of some recent results on time - series analysis of markov chains . <n> markov chain , fmie process , time series analysis .<n> let @xmath0 be a sequence of independent random walks starting at @xcite , where @math1 is an integer , and let @math2 be the average number of steps taken up to the moment when each walker is completely at rest with respect to the chain . in this paper , we are interested in the following question : what is the connection between the hitting time of the initial walker and the time it takes for the walker to coalesce into the first few members of the sequence ? <n> the answer is well - known in the physics community : there is a close connection between hitting times and spectral gaps of the associated mc , see e.g. , [ cox ] . here<n> i will try to give a brief introduction to this topic , focusing on some of the recent results obtained in a collaboration with sergey kovalenko and the second -

[ cols= \"  \" , ] the answer to this question is as follows  we prove that the mean meeting time of @xmath0 independent identically distributed (  fmie '' ) walkers on the two - dimensional torus is asymptotically larger than the mean time for the corresponding standard random walk on the torus to meet . <n> the result applies to the finite voter model @xcite , and also to a variety of special geometries .<n> the proof is elementary , in the sense that it does not rely on theorem [ t_oliveira ] , which would have given the same bound for all regular graphs . as a corollary of the result ,<n> we show that the number of fmie walkers meeting in the same place at the same time is bounded above by the number ( in units of the diameter ) of neighbors at which the meeting time has been reached in the previous interval ; this number depends on the geometry , but is of order unity for regular graphs and of order one for infinite - dimensional lattices . in a series of recent papers , we have studied fmie models on various finite geometries , including the toroidal lattice , the cylinder , a cone on the half - line , as well as the fano plane @x we consider the dynamics of the voter model in @xmath0 dimensions , in the limit as the number of agents tends to infinity .<n> the model has two stages . in stage 1 ,<n> agents are chosen uniformly uniformly at random ; in stage 2 , agents with opinions different from that of the initial agent meet in the next interval . <n> this model has been extensively studied , both in terms of geometry @xcite , and more generally in the finite - state setting @x<n> . however , there are other aspects of finite - time behavior one might study , such as transience of the chain on the limit infinite geometry , which have not been studied in the context of the finite voter model . here<n> we present some results on the time evolution of the density of opinions , as well as the distribution of the time it takes for a particular agent to change its opinion from one that is strongly in favor of or strongly against the model , for example , or to switch from one opinion to the other . *<n> introduction. * _ it has been a long - standing problem in the theory of interacting particle systems to characterize the time dependence of observables such as the density @x we show that the @xmath0 epidemic model has a local weak limit geometry .<n> the limit geometry is a galton - watson tree with a size - biased offspring distribution after the first generation . <n> * keywords : * transience , epidemics , tree , voter model , poisson process . in this paper , we consider the stochastic evolution of a large class of stochastic processes , which includes stochastic fractional brownian motion ( sbm ) , stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) and stochastic volatility models ( srrms ) among others .<n> we provide a general expression for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of stochastically moving parts of the stochastic process . as an application ,<n> we derive the pdf of the mean first passage time ( fps ) through the stochastic boundary of the sbm in the case of stochastic sbm and stochastic spde . <n> _ keywords _ : stochastic processes ( theory ) + pacs : 02.50.-r , 02.50.ey , 05.40.+j + _ we introduce a stochastic variant of the stochastic landau - zener game in which each agent has a finite amount of money . whenever two agents meet , they instantly play a fair game in in which one agent acquires the combined money , and vice versa .<n> we call this process the  disordered limit '' of the game . in the limit ,<n> the set of agents with non - zero money forms an  independent set '' ( no two are adjacent in the weighted graph ) ; conversely , this process is obviously an absorbing configuration on a general geometry . <n> _ * keywords : * stochastic games , stochastic partial differential equations , disordered limits , landau zener games .

* a sign - reversing involution that cancels the negative terms in the kac - weyl character formula , so that it reduces the weight to zero ; and , * a coherent timing pattern , i.e. , a timing pattern that takes values in any totally ordered set , where the partial orders take values in some other set . in particular , in this paper , we prove the existence of @xmath0-crystals , i.e. , perfect crystals whose weyl characters are @xcite . <n> a _ crystal graph _ is a directed colored graph with arrows labeled by points of a given dominant weight .<n> it is well - known that the most important source of crystals are integrable representations of quantum groups corresponding to kac - moody algebras . also note that such representations can be encoded by combinatorial data , known as _ crystals _ , satisfying axioms ( a1)-(a3 ) , which we call _ perfect crystals_. we prove that there are no perfect crystals that can not be colored more than twice , and that the number of such perfect crystals is at most @x . finally , for a fixed dominant weight we give an explicit construction of perfect crystals with a certain symmetry , as well as an explicit formula for the weyl character corresponding to a given crystal . the proof is given in two steps . in the first step ,<n> we define a total order on the set of simple roots such that the corresponding cardinalities are finite and countable . if the total order is in this paper , we introduce the notion of a lambda chain , which is a variant of the well - known @xmath0-chain .<n> the existence of such a chain is equivalent to finding a total order on the set of simple roots of the given set of roots , and we show that such an order can be induced by a certain sequence of rational numbers . as a consequence ,<n> we prove that the homotopy type of the lambda chain defined by the induced total order is finite . <n> the study of lambda chains has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli and zamolodchikov @xcite . in their seminal work<n> , they showed that a chain of roots is homotopic to a homotopically complete system , if and only if the corresponding homotopical order is strictly greater than the total order of the system . since then , lambda chains have been intensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally . for example , it was shown by bernjamini , daniel , edelsbrunner , mller - plenio , piatetski - szegowski - witten that a @ a @xmath0-chain is a chain with the property that every chain in the chain can be written as a sum of finitely many chains with the same length .<n> we show that , in the case of a finite root system , there is an interlacing condition in the definition of a lambda chain , which is equivalent to the fact that the induced total order on a finite chain is the same as the order on the corresponding vector space . <n> [ theorem]corollary the notion of a chain @xcite was introduced by john von neumann as a tool to study the structure of integrable systems of rational equations . in 1963 ,<n> riemann proved that any integrable system of real equations can be decomposed into a finite number of parts , called roots , such that each root is invariant under the action of the difference of the roots . as a consequence<n> , it is well - known that a finite system of roots can be discretized into roots by adding a constant factor to each other , and that a chain of roots of the same constant order can be obtained from a finite one by adding an additional constant factor . on the other hand , as was shown in this article , we introduce a new class of dynamical systems , the @xmath0-chain class .<n> we use this class to prove a conjecture of ahlfors , bernard , and zelevinsky , which states that the hausdorff dimension of a system of linearly folded chains is equal to the number of folded chains . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of a result of shapiro and zworski . <n> we define a lambda chain to be a chain that is invariant under the action of a dominant integral weight . in the case of a finite root system<n> , this definition is equivalent to the standard lambda chain . for a fixed dominant weight , it is straightforward to construct a chain whose total order is the same as the total order of the underlying root system , up to an interlacing condition , provided that the weight is sufficiently large . here<n> we show that it is possible to extend the definition to a larger class of objects , namely , fixed dominant integral weights , by folding a large class of chains together ; in particular , a fixed integral weight can be expressed as a linear combination of in this article , we introduce a new method for proving that a given dominant integral weight @xmath0 is invariant under a fixed dominant weight .<n> more precisely , given an arbitrary integral weight , an arbitrary @xcite , and an arbitrary ( fixed ) dominant weight ( in particular , a weight that is the sum of two dominant weights ) , let us fix a _ lambda chain _ , which is a chain invariant with respect to an arbitrary dominant weight and a dominant weight that does not exceed it . <n> we will assume that the following two conditions hold : ( 1 ) the following are true : * the lambda chain is coroots , as elements of the lambda-string through an arbitrary fixed dominant integral weights ; and ( 2 ) there is a sequence of positive roots , such that any given positive root appears only finitely many times in all of the above lambda chains . in particular<n> , there is no weight invariant if all positive roots are coroots and all negative roots are infinite . as a corollary of our main result ,<n> we obtain an upper bound on the size of the set of _ folding positions _ of a lambda in this paper , we consider the problem of counting the number of roots in @xmath0-chains with given weights .<n> we show that if the weight of a root is zero , then it is contained in the sum of the weights of all roots in the chain . <n> [ theorem]lemma [ theorem ] proposition [ theorem][ theorem]corollary this paper is devoted to the study of the counting problem for certain root systems . in this problem ,<n> we are interested in the following question : given a root @xcite , what is the number ( in absolute value ) of @x ?<n> the answer to this question is as follows : let us define the _ foldings _ of a given root system , that is , new objects constructed from the root system by applying folding operators ( a generalization of the notion of a _ gaussian operator _ that we introduce in this article ) . more precisely , let us consider the set of objects obtained from a root by applying a folding operator to that root ; we call these objects _<n> foldings_. in order to construct a folding from a given folding , one needs to consider a  we prove that the number of roots of @xmath0-chains of rank at most two is always finite .<n> more precisely , we show that if the rank of a root is one , then there exists a countable set of roots . <n> [ theorem]corollary this paper is dedicated to the memory of boris chernyak , a pioneer in the field of quantum information theory . in his pioneering work @xcite<n> , chernian proved that if two quantum systems are each other s limit system ( or its limit state ) , and the sum of the weights of the two systems is zero , there is always a finite number of non - zero roots of the corresponding quantum system . as a consequence ,<n> it is well - known ( see for example , the paper of berkooz , brninger , & cherniak ) that the total number of zeros of a given quantum system is at least @x . on the other hand , it is not known whether this number can be further reduced , or whether it is bounded away from zero ( see below for a review of the proof of brnninger - cher in this note , we present a new proof of the well - known result that the sum of two euclidean distances on the sphere is equal to the logarithm of the distance between its two ends .<n> we also prove a new result , which gives a formula for the counting function of pairs @xmath0 , indexed by affine reflections , in terms of the corresponding counting function for pairs in the sphere . <n> the idea of this paper comes from the fact that , according to the definitions of folding operators and of levels , an integer can be expressed as a sum of at most two terms , one of which is a rational number , and the other is a constant . in this sense , the definition of levels can be seen as a special case of the more general definition of the folding operators . as a result of this definition ,<n> it is well known that an integer is an even number if its sum is an odd number . on the other hand<n> , it is also known that if the value of the integers on the right - hand side of the definition is zero , then they are even . here<n> we will show that this is not the case when the values on in this paper , we introduce a new method for finding admissible subsets of affine hyperplanes .<n> more precisely , let @xmath0 be a chain , and let the following subchain be an admissible subset : ( 1 ) for every positive integer @xcite , there is a subchain @x , which we call _ admissible _ ; ( 2 ) there is an admissible set , called _ set - free _ ( or _ subset - set _ for short ) ; and ( 3 ) the set of all admissible sets is a _<n> hyperplane _ with respect to the affines , i.e. , a hyperplane in which the inner product of any two positive integers with positive roots is contained . for a given chain @x<n> , it is easy to see that all inner products of positive roots can be easily read off from the hyperplane set of admissible sets . in the second part ,<n> we define a new folding procedure , based on the idea of _ level - foldings _ introduced in section [ sec : hyperplanefoldings ] , for foldings of in this paper , we prove a formula for the number of @xmath0-fold foldings of a finite type .<n> this formula is a special case of a formula that we proved in section [ sec : foldings ] , which is based on a lemma that involves the gauss - bonnet formula , and which can be viewed as a generalization of the wang - landau formula . <n> the proof involves a careful analysis of the structure of admissible subsets , as well as of chains of foldings and their associated decompositions in the bruhat order . as a byproduct ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that the hausdorff dimension of the set of _ all _ young tableaux of finite type @xcite is at least 2 . in section <n> [ thm : tableaux ]<n> , it is shown that the following is equivalent : ( 1 ) the number ( in terms of the dimension ) of all foldings ( of a given type ) that are contained in the set ( of all finite types ) is at most 2 ;

( 2 ) a _ positive _ intrinsic criterion , which is a generalization of the classical intrinsic criterion of lascoux - schtzenberger ( cf .<n> proposition 5.7 ) ; and ( 3 ) an intrinsic criterion that is relevant to finite - type _ reflection characters _ , namely , the _ character formula _ for _ finite - weyl group elements_. we will see that the character formula for finite - types , as defined in @xcite , can be written in terms of _ weyl - type elements _ let @xmath0 be a chain , and let@xmath1 be the minimal number of copies of @xcite .<n> we show that the set of primitive elements of the bruhat order on a coxeter group is finitely generated . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a combinatorial proof of the existence of a chain with minimal length . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ] proposition [ proposition ] lemma [ proposition]conjecture [ propositions]proposition [ propositions ] definition [ propositions [ proposition][proposition]example [ propositions<n> ] in section [ sec : chains - foldings ] we prove that there exists a chain of minimal length in the root lattice of the following type : let @ x be a finite , compact , affine , symmetric group , whose elements form a sublattice of the lattice of positive integers . in the literature , this is known as the _ root lattice_. the definition of a root lattice is based on the notion of a _ chain _ , which is a generalization of the well - known _<n> bruhat _ order , cf . * let @xmath0 be a finite , compact , connected , affine lattice , with a single non - empty boundary .<n> we study the extremal set of cells , which is the minimal number of cells in the lattice that are required to make the cell structure extremal . <n> we prove that the extremality of this set is determined by a sequence of foldings of the lattice . as an application<n> , we show that the minimal extremal cell is the only cell that can be embedded into a cell of maximal dimension , and that this embedding is extremal in the sense that any embedding of the cell into a larger cell is also extremal<n> . we will also show that if we fix a simple root , then we can fold the set of extremal cells into a compact set , so that the number of elements in the compact set is the same as in the non - foldable case . in this way ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that the cell set of a compact lattice is extremally small . *<n> introduction. * it is well - known ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) that the following is a sufficient condition for in this paper , we will define the notion of a fixed @xmath0-chain , which is a generalization of the concept of a chain - folded chain .<n> we will also define a partial operator on the set of admissible subsets corresponding to our fixed chain , and we will show that this operator is determined by a continuous piecewise - linear function . <n> let us now fix a simple root and recall the description of the finite set of integers based on the continuous piece wise - linear functions , introduced in remark [ graphrep ] ( 2 ) . also recall the definition of a finite sequence based on a fixed chain - folding , denoted as in section [ sec : chains - foldings ] . in remark<n> [ lastlevel ] we have introduced a new class of finite sequences based on fixed chains , called _ foldings_. they are defined as follows : a ) a finite chain - fold is the union of infinitely many chains ;

order , ls chain , folding , root operator , lem timing pattern , schreier representation . we introduce a coherent timing pattern for a fixed @xmath0-type ls chain , analogous to that for a discrete - time chain .<n> we show that our timing pattern is a semiperfect crystal , and verify some of its properties , including the littlewood - richardson rule . <n> coherent timing is the study of a sequence of values of an observable , such as the position , time , or frequency , of an element of a physical system . in quantum mechanics ,<n> the concept of coherent timing was introduced by bell @xcite in connection with the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) effect , in which the state of a quantum system can be inferred from the values of some function of the system s parameters . since then , coherent timing has been used in a variety of contexts , e.g. in the context of quantum metrology , quantum error correction , as well as in the field of nanophotonics , where it plays a key role in the understanding of the dynamics of nanomechanical oscillators . for a given quantum system , a _ coherent _<n> timing pattern ( ctp ) is an iterative sequence of we introduce a new model of lakshmibai - seshadri chains in @xmath0 , which we call _ lakshmi - richardson model _ ( srm ) .<n> we show that sr is the limit of a family of piecewise - constant left - continuous maps , and we describe the dynamics of its orbit under the bruhat order . <n> this paper is the first step in a project to construct a new class of models , called _ dynamical _ models . in this paper<n> , we construct a dynamical model that is a generalization of the model introduced by littlewood and richardsen in their famous paper on weyl characters , also known as _ weyl maps_. we prove that the dynamical model is isomorphic to the model defined by the authors , as well as to a model introduced in our previous paper , _ discrete dynamical model with weyl character _<n> ( ddm ) @xcite . as in the case of the weyl model ,<n> our model can be seen to be a natural extension of the well - known model of a. lakshmi and s. seshdri , both we introduce a new model of lakshmibai - seshadri ( ls ) chains in @xmath0 , which we call _ littelmann chains_. our model is a generalization of the model introduced by shapiro and veseli @xcite , and we show that it is closely related to ls chains . in particular , we give a formula for the branching ratio of the _ dual _ ls chain in terms of its length .<n> we also show that our model induces a branching ratio between ls and dual chains that is the same as in the case when the latter are free . <n> the construction is based on a new type of symmetrization of the complex kac - moody algebra that we introduce in this paper . we show that littelmann paths from a fixed path to @xmath0 which lies inside the dominant weyl chamber have the structure of a perfect crystal , and that the corresponding colored directed graph does not depend on the initial path .<n> we also describe a bijection between the corresponding admissible subsets . <n> the concept of a _ path _ in complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras was born out of the desire to understand the geometry of paths in @xcite . in this paper , we will show that certain paths have a structure of perfect crystals . we will see that these paths are special cases of the paths corresponding to linear systems ( ls ) chains , which were first introduced by s. littelman in the early 1990s , still in the setup of complex - symmetry - preserving kacs . the latter were considered by kashiwara , lakshmibai and josephbai in the context of colored directed graphs , as well as by stembridge and the author in more general settings . here<n> we will concentrate on the special case of ls chains . for a precise description of the latter , see [ sec : finite ]  littelmann @xcite , lakshmibai , and joseph@xcite independently proved that @xmath0-littelmann paths ( obtained from a fixed path via root operators ) have the structure of a perfect crystal . we will show that there is a bijection between the littmann - shapiro ( ls ) chains corresponding to an antidominant weight on the set of simple roots and the corresponding admissible subsets .<n> we will also show that the colored directed graphs associated to these paths do not depend on the initial path . <n> the proof is based on a reformulation of the littlewood - richardson rule in terms of ls chains , as well as on a new proof of a result of stembridge on admissible systems of finite paths . in his pioneering work on crystallization of paths , littelman @x<n> considered the collection of all paths obtained by applying operators to a fixed continuous path which lies inside the dominant weyl chamber . he showed that these paths form a crystal , that the associated colored directed graph does not depend upon the initialpath ,<n> and that one can express the starting point as an ls chain in the weyl group @x let @xmath0 be an irreducible finite rank lie group .<n> we show that @x , for any positive real number , is a level sequence ( ls ) chain in bruhat order . as a consequence<n> , we obtain that the value of the ls in the space of rank - lie group elements is a constant . <n> the study of level - lie groups has a long history , going back to the work of gauss , fuchs and schinazi @xcite , and more recently also to schiffler , schinzel and zworski @x<n> . however , the main purpose of this paper is to present a new , combinatorially simple way to construct ls chains , as well as to give a combinatorial proof of a classical result of schowzi , which is to show that the level - lying group element of a finite - rank lie algebra is a bruhat - minimal coset representative of the level lie algebra of a positive real - valued lie group element . in this paper<n> we introduce a new method to construct saturated chains and we apply it to obtain a new class of examples of l in this note , we introduce a new approach to the study of @xmath0-fold symmetric differential operators .<n> this approach allows us to define , in a unified way , different types of folding operators , as well as to study their behavior at intersections with affine hyperplanes . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known result that @xcite . we construct paths in the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space that are extremal for the standard riemannian metric , but not necessarily for the special metric .<n> this allows us to prove that the minima of these paths are integers , which was proved by littelmann using different methods . as a corollary<n> , we obtain a new proof of a result by lakshmibai . <n> the study of extremal metrics is one of the oldest unsolved problems in combinatorics . in @xcite ,<n> kashiwara introduced a notion of extremality for the riemanian metric and used it to prove the existence of extremals for a large class of metrics , including the hausdorff metric ( see also , e.g. , the paper of murray , skorokhod , and the first two authors ) . since then , extremal metric problems have been found in a variety of contexts , ranging from the geometry to the statistics of financial transactions . on the other hand , it is well known that , in general , one can not construct extremal paths in a euclidian space ; in fact  we construct paths in the affine weyl group @xmath0 of a root system of a kac - moody algebra , and we show that the minima of the paths are integers .<n> we also show that a special choice of @ x can be viewed as a limiting case of our construction . <n> root systems are simple lie algebras that arise from root systems of quantum groups . in @xcite ,<n> kashiwara and joseph studied root systems with finite types ( i.e. , complex semisimple lie algebra ) ; in this paper , we study root systems for general types ( that is , root systems that are symmetrizable with respect to a finite number of root operators ) and we call them _ root systems _ , since they are related to root systems in a very natural way . our main result is the construction of paths in affian weyl groups , which is a generalization of the well - known path construction in quantum group theory . here<n> , a _ path _ is a sequence of open regions in the real vector space , called _ alcoves , that are adjacent if they are distinct and have given a complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebra , we conjecture that the colored directed graph defined by the action of root operators on the admissible subsets corresponding to the special choice of a @xmath0-chain does not depend on the choice of this chain . we prove this conjecture for root systems of finite types ( i.e. , complex semisimple lie algebras ) .<n> this model specializes to the model in @xcite in the case of finite irreducible root systems . in this paper , we study a model of @xmath0-chains , which was introduced in @xcite , based on the geometry of the generalized flag variety .<n> we show that our model is isomorphic to the model in our previous paper . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem][ theorem]corollary this paper is devoted to the study of a certain model of lambda chains , whose construction in our earlier paper was based on a geometric model of generalized flag varieties . in the present paper<n> we continue this study . here<n> we assume that the weight of the lambda chain is fixed and that the operator acting on the sequence of roots is irreducible ; in other words , the model is invariant under the action of the weyl group . in this paper , we study a model of @xmath0-chains that generalizes the model in @xcite , whose construction was based on the geometry of the generalized flag variety .<n> we prove that , in general , the littelmann paths that we construct from our model do _ not _ coincide with the lattice paths obtained by applying the coxeter number . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem)proposition [ theorem][ theorem]conjecture a _ reflection ordering _ is a natural generalization of the notion of a reflection ordering in the sense that reduced alcove paths , for instance , can be constructed from alcoves in affine hyperplanes , starting from an initial alcove path . a  gallery , '' in other words , is a sequence of codimension one common faces of the alcoves that can be obtained from a reduced alcove path by reflecting the tail in the hyperplane that contains the face . in the classical case ,<n> such sequences are known as _<n> _ littelmann s paths .

rays luminosities of the fainter ones ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . in this article<n> i will review the main observational findings on the nature of the low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) groups identified in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) and in the redshift survey of the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) ( ebeling et al 1996 , briel & henry 1995 , diaferio et al 1994 , rampazzo & sulentic 1992 , cavaliere et al 1991 , barnes 1989 , white 1990 , governato et al 1993 , pildis et al 1997 ) we present the results of a study of the x - ray properties of galaxies in small groups selected on the basis of their compact appearance and red colors .<n> we found that in most cases the galaxies in compact groups are not brighter than @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 in the band 0.5 - 2.0 kev . <n> the fraction of blue ( gas - rich ) galaxies increases with the group s velocity dispersion , so the blue galaxies are more likely to reside in the centers of the groups than the red galaxies . in contrast , first - ranked galaxies appear to be the same as the general population of early - type galaxies , which is consistent with these systems being compact clusters or groups of galaxies of type s0 or e , and not merger products . the shakhbazian groups appear to be mostly small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . if the groups are dynamically bound , galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times . both n - body and hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the dark matter halos of individual galaxies merge first , creating a massive envelope within which the visible galaxies move ( barnes 1984 , bode et al 1993 ) . kinematic studies of loose groups ( eg . puche & carignan 1991 ) and<n> x - ray observations indicate that in most compact groups , the gas and dark matter is more extended and is decoupled from the galaxies .<n> this may explain the observation that galaxies in compact groups typically have mass - to - light ratios 30% to 50% lower than more isolated galaxies ( rubin et al 1991 ; del olmo et al 1994 ; pildis et al 1995 ; moles et al 1996 ; hickson 1997 )<n> . however , few galaxies in these studies show all of these effects simultaneously . i review the evidence for mergers in compact groups of galaxies , and argue that they may account for as much as 25% of the present - day elliptical population . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present the results of a search for compact groups in the redshift range @xmath0 using the ctio 4 m telescope .<n> we have found a total of 15 compact groups with redshifts in the range : _<n> ( a ) _ hcg 31 , hcg 44 and hcg 31a ; _ ( b )<n> _ iras 23532 , a seyfert 1 and a qso , all of which are likely to be associated with compact groups . <n> we find that the comoving number density of qsos peaks at @xcite , and that there is a strong correlation between the luminosity of the qso and the size of its host group , in the sense that larger groups are more likely to contain luminous agn , while smaller groups contain agn at lower luminosities . in the case of hcg 44 ,<n> the luminosity function of the host group is consistent with that of an isolated elliptical galaxy , as is the size - luminosity correlation found for present - day elliptical galaxies , suggesting that the group is the remnant of a recent merger . if hcg 44 is a relic , then the number of relics per observed we present a study of the properties of small ( @xmath0 ) groups of galaxies .<n> we find that there is a strong tendency for the comoving number density of compact groups to increase with redshift , with a peak at a redshift of about 3 . <n> the distribution of the number of groups per unit redshift can be approximated by a power - law function , and the slope of the power law can be used as a function of redshift to estimate a lower limit on the matter density of the universe . for a fixed value of the cosmological constant , we find a logarithmic slope of about 1.9 , which is shallower than the slope found for clusters of galaxies with a similar density parameter , but is in agreement with the value found by other authors for the baryon fraction in clusters . at redshifts ,<n> the peak of the compact - group number density function is found at a comoving density of about 1 , consistent with observations of the peak density of qsos . in our study<n> we have performed a search for compact groups containing either starburst galaxies or agn . from this sample , <n> we conclude that there are probably no fossils of the end product of a i review the physical properties of compact groups of galaxies , their role in the formation of galaxies both past and present , and their place in the overall clustering hierarchy of the universe .<n> star formation occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong . this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath0 . from an examination of condensations in tidal tails ,<n> hunsberger et al ( 1996 ) concluded that the fraction of dwarf galaxies produced within tidal debris in compact groups is not negligible . <n> star clusters form from tidal debris . because compact groups have a high galaxy surface density , they may form effective gravitational lenses . gravitational amplification of background field galaxies was proposed by hammer and nottale ( 1986 ) and mendes de oliveira and giraud ( 1994 ) as a possible explain for the presence of the high -

ray - emitting gas trapped within the gravitational potential well . in a low - density universe<n> the infall rate is insufficient . as there is at present no other clear mechanism for avoiding overproduction of relics by merging compact groups , this may be a strong argument for a high -

trivial way . in three spatial dimensions<n> we identify three limiting vortex states characterized by the smallest ( i.e. , the most negative ) rate of enstroph production : the taylor - green vortex , in which the flow is characterized by a high degree of nonlinearity , and the vortex in which enstrophic effects are negligible . for finite values , however , we identify a distinct branch of extreme vortex states parameterized by the en strophy : there is a unique vortex state for each of the three limiting states . <n> the development of potential singularities ( ss ) is one of the central themes in the study of turbulence , both in classical and quantum systems @xcite , as well as in areas such as fluid dynamics , medicine and biology . to date , a number of studies have been devoted to the formation of s in the euler and navier - stokes we study the time evolution of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) abc vortex problem with finite enstrophy , @xmath0 , in the presence of sobolev vorticity gradients .<n> we find that , for small values of the enstroph , the flow exhibits extreme behaviour , characterized by the formation of a singularity at a characteristic rate of growth of enstrophic . for larger values ,<n> the flow undergoes a transition from a supercritical to a subcritical regime , which is accompanied by a change in the character of the potential singularity . <n> vortex - driven abc flows are ubiquitous in both fundamental and applied research @xcite . in this context<n> , they play an important role in a variety of contexts , ranging from fluid mechanics , chemistry and biology to biology and medicine , and they are also of interest in their own right , e.g. , because of their potential applications in the design of new materials , biomimetic devices , as well as for their fundamental importance in the study of phase transitions . despite their wide range of applications , _<n> i.e. _ , from industrial to biomedical systems , we study the effect of vorticity on the instantaneous growth of enstrophy in a two - dimensional fluid with a fixed number of vortices , @xmath0 .<n> we find that the instantaneous rate of growth of the strain induced by the vortex fields exhibits a power - law dependence on the dimensionless vortity exponent , which can be interpreted in terms of the local balance between the strain rate and the vortex magnitude . in the limit of a three - dimensional system ,<n> we show that the energy of the optimal vortex states saturates poincar s inequality , so that the optimal fields are eigenfunctions of the laplacian . <n> the study of the response of a fluid to external forces has been a topic of considerable interest since the early days of hydrodynamics @xcite . over the years<n> a great deal of attention has been devoted to 2d systems , in particular to the problem of a vortex - dominated fluid , for which a number of interesting results have been obtained , e.g. , see , _ phys . rev<n> . lett . * 95 * , 130402 ( 2005 ) _ and , more we study the effect of enstrophy on vortex dynamics in a two - dimensional fluid with a non - linear equation of state @xmath0 describing the balance between the strain rate and the vorticity magnitude .<n> we find that enstroph enhances the rate of growth of entropy , leading to the formation of localized vortex structures . as a consequence ,<n> the energy of the system decreases and the system exhibits a crossover from a diffusive to an integro - differential behaviour . <n> vortices play an important role in the structure and function of a wide range of systems , ranging from suspensions to colloidal solutions @xcite . in this context<n> , they have been studied extensively both theoretically @x , as well as experimentally , in a variety of contexts , from suspensions of colloidal particles to suspensions of granular materials and from dilute solutions of polymers to colloidal emulsions and suspensions of emulsions , to mention only a few . from a mathematical point of view , vorttices are important in understanding the behavior of a large variety of systems including colloidal suspensions , granular materials , emulsions of different shapes and sizes , suspensions of different chemical species and polymers , and suspensions and emulsions turbulence is characterized by enstrophy @xmath0 , a measure of shear viscosity , which is inversely proportional to the turbulent velocity .<n> it is well known that turbulence can be described in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xcite . here<n> we show that the solution of the odes allows for the formation of localized vortex structures for large values of enstroph , provided that the viscosity is small compared to the energy . as a result ,<n> the energy of the optimal fields exhibits a power - law behaviour as a function of the range of the enstrophic parameter , while the maximum vorticity , velocity , and maximum energy exhibit two distinct power laws as functions of this parameter . <n> turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide variety of contexts , from physics to biology . in particular , it plays an important role in our understanding of how the world operates , be it in a natural environment or in a man - made fluid . the study of turbulence has a long history , going back to the work of kolmogorov , einstein and rosen in the 1950 s @x<n> . navier - stokes turbulence is characterized by a large enstrophy @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the energy to the kinetic energy .<n> the maximum vorticity , or , equivalently , the maximum velocity , has been proposed as an indicator of the onset of turbulence . here ,<n> we report the largest value of the enstroph reported to date , a value close to unity , attained in computations of the most extreme vortex states . <n> turbulence is ubiquitous in nature , from oceans to the earth , and plays an important role in a wide range of natural and social systems . in particular , in the context of landslides , earthquakes , winds and wildfires , it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of turbulent structures @xcite , as well as the mechanisms responsible for the production of heat , electricity and mass in the atmosphere . while the turbulence - energy relation has been the subject of intense research and debate over the past decades , very little is known about the structure of extreme vortices , i.e. , states of energy that exceed the maximum value allowed by the energy - entropy relation , @x the navier - stokes equations in two and three dimensions are known to support long - lived extreme vortex states . here , we report the largest value of the enstrophy reported so far , @xmath0=@xmath1 , corresponding to the largest energy of the taylor - green vortex in two dimensions .<n> this value is also the one at which the  small data '' condition guaranteeing long - time existence of smooth solutions can be sharpened , so that smooth solutions exist globally in time . in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) ,<n> the energy of extreme vortices is known to be given by a power law @xcite , with an exponent related to the strength of the vortex - antivortex ( abc ) interaction . for 3d navier stokes incompressible fluids ( 3dnfs )<n> , the same power law has been reported for the energy , but with a different exponent , indicating that the abc interaction plays a dominant role . <n> [ [ section ] ] the aim of this paper is to study the large - scale properties of extreme vortex solutions in the 2d and 3d ( cf . [  blow - up problems in hydrodynamics have been the subject of many studies in the last decades .<n> they provide a deep insight into the physics of instabilities and turbulence , and have been used to shed light on the mechanisms governing the transition from a turbulent to a laminar state , the so - called  jet - driven '' transition , for example . in this context , it has been shown that , in the absence of any external perturbation , long - time existence of smooth solutions can not be a priori guaranteed for the navier - stokes system . however , this  small data '' result has not been completely understood so far . here , we provide the conditions on the size of the initial data and enstrophy , used as initial conditions , so that smooth solutions exist globally in time . we also show that the finite - time growth of enstroph obtained using different types of initial data is in good agreement with estimates based on physical arguments . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + = = = # 1#2#3#4#1 , # 2 ( # 3 ) # 4 the problem of the  blown - up '' problem @x the navier - stokes system is one of the simplest models describing turbulence .<n> it has been extensively studied in the literature , both in terms of analytical solutions and numerical simulations . in this paper<n> , we provide a detailed analysis of the time - dependent behaviour of this system , focusing in particular on the relation between the initial enstrophy @xmath0 and the finite - time growth of the vortex energy . we show that finite - times blow - up of extreme vortex states occurs only for the values of the initial entropy ( enstroph ) which are on the boundary of the region of guaranteed long - time regularity , and not for other types of initial conditions used in previous studies . <n> turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide variety of contexts , ranging from the formation of stars @xcite , to the propagation of waves in the atmosphere and to the transport of chemical species in plasmas @x<n> . however , our understanding of turbulence is still far from satisfactory , particularly in relation to the dynamical properties of the system under study . to this aim ,<n> a number of studies have been performed in recent years @x . among these<n> are the study we study the time evolution of taylor - green vortex flows in two - dimensional phase space with a variable enstrophy @xmath0 .<n> it is shown that finite - time blow - up is not a priori guaranteed for flows starting from different values of the initial enstroph . in particular , for high enstrophic initial conditions , which are characterized by a tendency for growth , the flow starting from the instantaneous maximizers does not reach the maximum in time as the estimate saturates . on the other hand , flow evolutions starting from a number of different initial conditions<n> do reach this maximum in finite time , in agreement with the fact that the initial data saturate the estimate . <n> vortices are common in nature , appearing in a wide variety of situations , including turbulence @xcite , superfluid flows in the mediterranean , and even in planetary atmospheres , where they can be turbulent or non - turbulent depending on the strength of the local magnetic field . for vortex - dominated turbulence ,<n> the existence of a global - in - time ( i.e. , quasi - periodic ) regularity has been a long - standing goal in theoretical and numerical fluid dynamics using a gradient - based approach , we solve the three - dimensional vlasov - maxwell equation for a vortex with local enstrophy @xmath0 .<n> we find that the maximum value of the enstroph increases as functions of time , which can be interpreted as a finite - time blow - up event . in the limit<n> when the vortex is in the taylor - green phase , the maximum of the initial enstrophic increase is obtained . <n> vortices are vortex - like structures that appear in a wide variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems @xcite . among these systems ,<n> one of the most striking features is that they do not exhibit phase separation , i.e. , vorticity does not form in a homogeneous way , but rather in a series of distinct spatial and temporal regions separated by vortex - rich regions , where the spatial structure of the vorttices is very different from that of the vortex - free regions . on the other hand , it is well known that the dynamics of vortex - induced turbulence is characterized by the existence of phase - separated regions @x<n> . this might be rephrased in the context of turbulence as we study the time evolution of the enstrophy of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin model subject to a uniform external field .<n> this problem has recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of spin models of biological systems , where it has been shown that the maximum entropy state of the model can be reached in time @xmath0 much faster than predicted by standard estimates . in this paper<n> we show that this prediction is in fact incorrect , by demonstrating that the time - dependent enstroph of the 2d model exhibits a power - law behaviour in the limit of vanishing field , as well as in the time at which the maximum is achieved . <n> [ sec : intro ] spin models have been extensively used to describe a wide range of biological phenomena , ranging from the formation of dna hairpins to the dynamics of motility in cells , cf . the review in [ sec:3d_instopt_e0to0 ] . here<n> we focus on the case of 2d spin models , which have recently been shown to be relevant in the study of motility - dependent cellular motility @xcite , and to exhibit a number of interesting properties , such as we study the optimal time evolution of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) edwards - anderson model in the limit of infinite time @xmath0 .<n> we show that the model exhibits a transition from a regime in which the optimal rate of growth of enstrophy is sustained to one in which it is depleted in finite time , in agreement with the predictions of a recent study in 2d by @xcite . in the latter case<n> , the optimal state of the model was found to belong to a family of  global maximizers '' , which were constructed using a continuation approach and whose analytic properties were studied using numerical optimization techniques . here<n> we report the results of a systematic study of the properties of these maximizers in 3d and 2d as well as their implications for the dynamics of the 2d model . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of time - dependent evolutions of physical systems is one of the central themes in theoretical physics , with applications ranging from fluid mechanics to condensed matter physics and biology . over the past decades<n> a great deal of effort has been devoted to the development of theoretical and numerical methods to solve the edward - andersen ( e ) we study the evolution of the vorticity field corresponding to the instantaneous optimizers @xmath0 in the 3d navier - stokes problem on an unbounded domain with axisymmetric initial data .<n> it is known that the problem is globally well - posed in the limit of vanishing boundary effects . here , we show that for the problem with finite - time regularity , there is no evidence of sustained growth of enstrophy strong enough to signal formation of a singularity in finite time . in particular , for the initial data for which global - in - time regularity can not be ensured a priori , the flow is incapable of sustaining the rate of growth at which the optimal vortex state is reached . <n> the navier stokes ( ns ) problem @xcite on a finite domain with boundary effects is known to be globally well posed , a result which is a consequence of the celebrated theorem due to navier and stokes . at the same time , it is well known that for an initial data which is invariant under time - reversal invariant transformations ( tmr ) the ns problem is ill - posed . on the other hand , in the presence of boundary effects the the navier - stokes problem on an unbounded three - dimensional ( 3d ) domain is known to be globally well posed @xcite .<n> however , in order to search for potentially singular solutions , it is often observed that the corresponding flow evolutions do not reveal any evidence for finite - time singularity formation . here , by constructing the most extreme initial conditions allowed by the mathematically rigorous estimates , this study offers a fundamentally different perspective on the problem of searching for potentially singularity solutions from most earlier investigations . indeed , while the flow evolution obtained by maximizing @xmath0 produced a significantly larger growth of enstrophy in finite time than any other candidate initial conditions ( cf . <n> figure [ fig : fvs_t_fixe ] ) , the time interval during which the extremal growth ofenstrophy is sustained in 3d is shorter than the corresponding intervals in 1d and 2d . by studying the power laws characterizing the maximizers , we also observe that the flow energy can not be increased arbitrarily as it is upper - bounded by poincar s inequality . in particular , if the initial energy is not sufficiently large , then its depletion due to the initial we report the results of a detailed study of the extreme behaviour of the navier - stokes vortices in three - dimensional flows . by constructing the initial data to exhibit the most extreme behaviour allowed for by the mathematically rigorous estimates ,<n> we demonstrate that the finite - time growth of enstrophy @xmath0 is sustained in 3d in a fundamentally different way than in 1d and 2d , and that the time interval during which this growth is sustained is shorter than the corresponding intervals in both cases .<n> we also show that the estimate is saturated by the flow evolution corresponding to the optimal initial data , but only for short times , which are not long enough to trigger a singular behaviour . <n> the study of extreme behaviour in flows has a long history , from the work of navier and stokes @xcite on incompressible fluids to the more recent investigations of turbulence in turbulent fluids . in the latter case<n> , it has been demonstrated that the most natural initial conditions for the solution of the equations of motion are vortex - dominated , i.e. , that the solution is a superposition of two homogeneous states , vortex and vortex - antivortex , with the opposite vor the extreme behaviour of the navier - stokes flow in the vicinity of the critical point is studied in this paper .<n> it is shown that the extreme vortex states found in earlier studies can be used to construct optimal initial data for the variational optimization problem , resulting in sustained growth of enstrophy in finite time , which is confirmed by numerical simulations in 2d and 3d . in 3d<n> this growth is found to be sustained to the poincar limit , corresponding to the extreme vortices already found in the earlier 2d study . <n> it has been known for a long time that the behaviour of a turbulent flow close to its critical point ( cep ) is characterized by the appearance of singularities @xcite , in particular by the divergence of the correlation functions @xmath0 , the kelvin - helmholtz invariants @x<n> , and the casimir - polder drag , associated with the onset of instabilities in the vorticity - velocity field , as well as with the occurrence of depinning instabilty in the incompressible - viscous - viscous flow , cf . for navier <n> stokes flows , @ we study initial data for the navier - stokes system which could lead to a more sustained growth of enstrophy in finite time by allowing for a smaller instantaneous rate of growth .<n> this can be achieved by prescribing an additional constraint in the formulation of the variational optimization problem , resulting in problem [ pb : maxdedt_e ] @xmath0 , which is more complicated as it involves flow evolution . in introduction we showed that estimate need not be saturated for blow - up to occur in finite - time and , in fact , sustained growth at the rate , i.e. , with any exponent , given by the value of the prescribed energy would also produce singularity in finite _ time_. however , we find that this is not the case for the extreme vortex states already found in the 3d setting in [ sec : 3d_in stopping_e0to0 ] , and to the poincar limit , as the flow evolution starting from such an initial data does not in fact produce a significant growth of entropy . <n> vorticity is one of the most fundamental concepts in fluid mechanics , being at the core of hydrodynamics , turbulence",

vanishing currents . theoretical studies of dds have revealed basic differences between systems in thermal equilibrium and systems far from thermal equilibrium .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with short -

species driven diffusive model exhibiting phase separation and spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry on a ring . in the model nearest - neighbor particles exchange with given rates and the numbers of each species are conserved under the dynamics .    in the model the rates of all local dynamical moves that obey the conservation laws are non zero .     in the present work we provide an argument indicating that generically the system phase separates , thus breaking the translational invariance , was given for the case when none of the species of particle has zero density .     in the special case of equal number of particles of each type , it was shown that the local dynamics obeys detailed balance with respect to a long -

the difference to the quantum - mechanical result can hardly be recognised . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the integral therefore is also a uniform expression for the semiclassical density of states , containing the contributions of all periodic orbits . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the numerical evaluation becomes , however , very time consuming for even finer energy resolutions ( i.e. , still smaller values of @xmath199 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ our main result here is that up to a rather fine resolution , the shell structure of the present perturbed ho system is dominated by the two - fold degenerate families of diameter and circle orbits , although these are not the most degenerate orbits . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is a rather unusual situation , due to the fact that the shortest tori with the highest degeneracy are considerably longer ( by a factor @xmath21610 ) than the primitive the stationary condition can be fulfilled .     ( note that the contribution of the corresponding pairs of negative integers is included in the amplitudes by a factor 2 . )     the actions of the tori are given by s^t_nm(e ) = ns_r(e , l_nm)+m2l_nm(e ) , [ stori ] and their amplitudes by ^t_nm(e ) = t_r(e , l_nm)l_nm(e ) ( n| |_l = l_nm(e))^-1/2(e - e_n : m ) , [ amptori ] where @xmath114 is the action unit given in .     the heaviside step function in is defined as ( x ) = 0 x < 0,(x ) = 1/2 x = 0,(x ) = 1/2 x = 0,where the value 1/2 for @xmath225 accounts for the fact that one obtains only half a fresnel integral when the stationary point is the upper end point of the integral in .     the heaviside step function in is defined as ( x ) = 0 x < 0,(x 1/4e^-3/4l , we obtain the `` unit energy '' equation 1 = 12q^2 + 14q^4 + , where the dot again means derivative with respect to the scaled time @xmath110 . ㅋ hence the classical equations of motion become independent of energy and @xmath1 . after obtaining all the classical results , we can reintroduce @xmath18 and @xmath1 just by remembering that lengths scale with @xmath229 , momenta with @xmath230 , times ( periods ) with @xmath231 , actions and angular momenta with @xmath232 . ㅋ we obtain the semiclassical trace formula from the results of the previous sections and of the appendix [ app3 ] simply by taking the limit @xmath30 , which means practically by extracting the leading terms for @xmath233 . in this way , ㅋ we obtain the following primitive periods and actions for the circle orbit : t_c(e ) = 2 ^ -1/4(4e/3)^-1/4 , [ app3 ] simply by taking the limit @xmath30 , which means practically by extracting the leading terms for @xmath233 . in this way , ㅋ This is demonstrated by their resonance condition ( cf .  also ) . perturbed 2-dimensional systems @xcite .    next we have used the standard ebk quantisation and the poisson summation formula to derive a general semiclassical trace formula for arbitrary central potentials in terms of a one - dimensional integral over the angular momentum @xmath96 of the classical orbits , given in .    the exact integration and summation over all @xmath248 yields , to leading order in @xmath77 , the ebk spectrum .    we have used the ebk quantisation and the poisson summation formula to derive a general semiclassical trace formula for arbitrary central potentials in terms of a one - dimensional integral over the angular momentum @xmath96 of the classical orbits , given in .    the exact integration and summation over all @xmath248 yields , to leading order in @xmath77 , the ebk spectrum .    we have used the ebk quantisation and the poisson summation formula to derive a general semiclassical trace formula for arbitrary central potentials .    the end - point contributions yield the diameter orbits with @xmath164 and the circle orbits with maximum angular momentum ; both contributions are of next - to - leading order xcite , of a spherical cavity potential ( with ideally reflecting walls ) which has turned out to be a realistic model for large spherical metal clusters . escription ( we re - derive the semiclassical trace formula of balian and bloch for the spherical cavity in appendix [ appbb ] . ) there the famous super - shells @xcite come from the interference of the shortest three - fold degenerate tori ( the triangle and square orbits ) , whereas the two - fold degenerate diameter orbit family has virtually no effect on the observable shell structure of these systems . escription our results explain qualitatively the numerical quantum - mechanical hf results @xcite for harmonically trapped fermionic atom gases . escription a more quantitative comparison , in which the strength @xmath1 of the perturbation in is determined directly from the numerically obtained self - consistent hf potentials , is in progress @xcite . escription lazzari _ et al . _ escription @xcite have studied the periodic orbits in a spherical woods - saxon potential in connection with the physics of metal clusters and thereby focused on the contributions of the diameter orbits . escription a more quantitative comparison , in which the strength @xmath1 of the perturbation in is the parametrisation of @xmath2p@xmath3 given in @xcite .    we start with three complex numbers @xmath256 : ( z_1,z_2,z_3 ) = ( n_1,n_2e^i_2,n_3e^i_3 ) , with @xmath257 , @xmath258 , and @xmath259 , @xmath260 , whereby the @xmath261 are restricted to n_1    n_2    n_2   n_2   n_3   n_3   n_3   n_3   n_3   n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3  n_3 _ @xmath294 and @xmath295 , respectively . the square of the conserved total angular momentum then is l^2 = * l*^2 = ( _ 0_0)^2 = ( _ 0_0)^2 = ^2 ^ 2 ( * e*__)^2 ( * e*__)^2 , so that the action perturbation becomes , after the substitution @xmath302 , s_1 = - , . \u001c [ ds1a ] the integration measure for is d_s^5 = ^2d_s^2(*e * _ ) ^2d_s^2(*e*_)d = 18 ^ 2d d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) d_s^2(*e * _ ) e^-ik/.

type formula in @xmath4 .  embodiments our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 .  embodiments this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the langland s dual group @xmath7 .  embodiments alcove paths correspond to decompositions of elements in the affine weyl group .  embodiments our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 .  embodiments this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the chains of positive roots defined by certain interlacing conditions . � these new objects extend the notion of a reflection ordering @xcite , and have many interesting combinatorial properties , some of which are investigated in this paper . � the extension from the finite to the infinite case is nontrivial since the description in terms of the affine weyl groups and alcoves is no longer available in the latter case . � compared to the geometric approach in @xcite ( involving the equivariant @xmath2-theory of @xmath3 ) , the generalization in this paper is carried out purely in the context of representation theory , and , in this process , new features of our model are added . � for instance , we define root operators in our model , and study their properties . � this allows us to show that our model satisfies the axioms of an admissible system of stembridge @xcite . � thus , we easily derive character formulas , a littlewood - richardson rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations , as well as a branching rule . the approach via admissible systems was already applied to ls chains in ( * ? ? ? � this allows us to , when a path is deformed into one which passes through the intersection of these hyperplanes .    when a path is deformed into a single hyperplane ( in some cases , such as the one related to the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite , the lost information needs to be recovered , but this is done by a nontrivial lift from @xmath10 to @xmath5 ; the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite based on our model obviates this lift . )    the main advantage of our model is related to its combinatorial nature .    this model is computationally efficient because it uses simple labels for the vertices of an irreducible crystal , namely certain finite sets of positive integers ( called admissible subsets ) ; these can be efficiently constructed .    the main advantage of our model is that, although a @xmath0-chain might be an infinite object , we do not need to store it , since we always work with a finite set of objects ( cf .   we have a finite set of objects , and we always work with a finite set of objects ( see remark [ finiteness ] ) . xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 for some integer @xmath32 , as well as @xmath23 such that @xmath33 , we have @xmath34    it turns out that , in the finite case , condition  ( 2 ) is equivalent to a condition stating that any triple of roots @xmath29 with @xmath35 satisfies the following interlacing property : there is exactly one element from the set @xmath36 between any two consecutive @xmath37 s , as well as before the first @xmath37 ; and there are no @xmath27 s or @xmath38 s after the last @xmath37 .     it turns out that , according to condition  ( 1 ) , the index set @xmath22 is always a countable or a finite set .     it turns out that , according to condition  ( 1 ) , the index set @xmath22 is always a countable or a finite set .     it turns out that , in the finite case , the index set @xmath22 is always a countable or a finite set .     it turns out that , in the finite math67 : @xmath68    we will define a colored graph structure on the collection of admissible subsets . from this , we will deduce a rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations and a branching rule .    the general outline of the paper follows . in section  [ sec : notation ]  [ sec : notation ] , we review basic notions related to roots systems for complex symmetrizable kac -

( hickson 1982 ) .      yet another effect is that groups may be more noticeable if the magnitude spread of their members is small .      thus , the catalog may also be incomplete for magnitude intervals greater than about 1.5 ( prandoni et al 1994 ) .      these effects are of critical importance in statistical analyses of the sample .      one immediate conclusion is that the actual number of groups which satisfy the selection criteria may be considerably larger than the number found by a subjective search .      it has recently become feasible to find compact groups by automated techniques .      mamon ( 1989 ) used a computer to search tully s ( 1987 ) catalog of nearby galaxies and identified one new compact group , satisfying hickson s criteria , in the virgo cluster .      prandoni et al ( 1994 ) applied similar criteria to digital scans of @xmath6 deg@xmath7 around the southern galactic pole and detected 59 new southern compact groups ( scgs ) .      it has recently become feasible to find compact groups by automated techniques .      mamon ( 1989 ) used a computer to search tully s ( 1987 ) catalog of nearby galaxies and identified one new compact group , satisfying hickson s criteria , in the virgo cluster bias .     the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature .     the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) .    the hcgs are not clustered in clusters , but a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters .      this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion .       however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups .    a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups .    a recent study by rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters .    a number of studies of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( vennik et al 1993 , ramella et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , garcia 1995 , xmath10 km s@xmath3 ( the sharp peak at zero velocity results from the use of the median ) . � this characteristic velocity is quite similar to velocity dispersions found in loose groups , and much smaller than typical velocity dispersions in rich clusters . � in addition to the gaussian core , a flat component is seen in the velocity distribution of figure 2 . � this is expected as some galaxies which are not physically related to the group will appear projected on the group by chance . � this component contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies . whether of not chance projection � can account for such a large number of `` discordant '' galaxies is still a matter of some debate , and is discussed further in section 6.1 .     for a system of characteristic linear size @xmath11 and internal velocity @xmath12 , � this component contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies . whether of not chance projection � can account for such a large number of `` discordant '' galaxies is still a matter of some debate , and is discussed further in section 6.1 .    for a system of characteristic linear size @xmath11 and internal velocity @xmath12 , � noticed in visual searches \u001c . it will be interesting to see if these results are confirmed by studies of groups found by automated searches . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if the intrinsic shapes of compact groups are related to their formation process , one might expect to see a relationship between the orientation angle of a group and the environment . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ palumbo et al ( 1993 ) examined the environments of the hcgs , and found that the orientations of the major axes of the groups were consistent with an isotropic distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if compact groups are not simply projection effects , they might be expected to show a centrally - concentrated surface density profile , as is seen in clusters of galaxies . although the number of galaxies in individual compact groups is small , with a large sample it is possible to estimate a mean profile . by scaling and superimposing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the hcgs , hickson et al ( 1984 ) found evidence for central concentration . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ mendes de oliveira & girard ( 1994 ) , using a similar analysis , concluded that the mean surface density profile is consistent with a king ( 1962 ) model with typical core radius of 15@xmath19 kpc . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ most recently , montoya et al ( 1996 ) have analyzed the profiles of the 42 hcg . � a crucial clue is that the morphology - density relation seen in clusters and loose groups ( dressler 1980 , postman & geller 1984 , whitmore & gilmore 1992 ) is not the dominant correlation in compact groups ( hickson et al 1988b ) , although some effect is present ( mamon 1986 ) . � this suggests that the velocity dispersion is more fundamental , ie of greater physical relevance to the formation and evolution of galaxies in compact groups , than is apparent physical density . � there is much evidence that interaction is occurring in a large fraction of galaxies in compact groups . � the strongest direct support comes from kinematical studies . � rubin et al ( 1991 ) found that two thirds of the 32 hcg spiral galaxies that they observed have peculiar rotation curves . � this show asymmetry , irregularity and in some cases extreme distortion , characteristic of strong gravitational interaction . � this result has recently been challenged by mendes de oliveira et al ( preprint ) who obtained h@xmath25 velocity maps for 26 hcg spiral galaxies and found that only 1/3 showed abnormal rotation curves . � they suggest that the difference is due to the more - complete spatial sampling of their data . ” sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ obtained a luminosity function for hcg galaxies similar to that of field galaxies . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ their best -

induced star formation , at least for the spiral galaxies . on the other hand mendes   , mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) compared their luminosity function of elliptical galaxies in compact groups with those in the virgo and coma clusters ( as reported by sandage et al 1985 and thompson & gregory 1980 ) and found that that the compact - group ellipticals have a luminosity enhancement of more than 1 mag compared to cluster ellipticals .     mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) compared their morphological - type - specific luminosity function of elliptical galaxies with those in the virgo and coma clusters ( as reported by sandage et al 1985 and thompson & gregory 1980 ) and found that that the compact - group ellipticals have a luminosity enhancement of more than 1 mag compared to cluster ellipticals .    mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) obtained a ratio of @xmath33 . applying the same analysis to the luminosity function of error . � analysis of improved data ( eg . allam et al 1996 ) should soon resolve questions about the identifications and infrared fluxes . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � zepf ( 1993 ) compared the ratio of 60 @xmath35 m to 100 @xmath35 m fluxes of compact group galaxies with those of isolated galaxies and also with those of galaxies believed to be currently merging . � he found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated spirals it originates in the disk . � if this is also true for the infrared flux , there must be an enhancement k menon , private communication ) . ㅋ continuum radio emission has also been detected in a number of hcg elliptical galaxies . unlike those found in cluster ellipticals , the radio sources are low - luminosity and compact . where spectral indices are available ㅋ , they indicate that the radio emission arises from an agn rather than from starburst activity ( tk menon , private communication ) . in the hcg sample ㅋ , there is a significant preference for radio - loud elliptical galaxies to be first - ranked optically ( menon & hickson 1985 , menon 1992 ) . ㅋ the probability of radio emission does not correlate with absolute luminosity , but instead correlates with _ relative _ luminosity within a group . ㅋ spiral hcg galaxies do not show this effect . although the tendency of radio galaxies in rich clusters to be first - ranked has been known for many years , it is surprising to find a similar effect in small groups , where the number of galaxies and luminosity range is small ㅋ the probability of radio emission does not correlate with absolute luminosity , but instead correlates with _ relative _ luminosity within a group . ㅋ spiral hcg galaxies do not show this effect . although the tendency of radio galaxies radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . � high - resolution studies of individual groups ( williams & van gorkom 1988 , williams et al 1991 ) showed clearly that the gas is not confined to the galaxies . in two of � high - resolution studies of the three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . these results strongly indicate that at least these compact groups are physically dense systems and not chance alignments or transient configurations in loose groups . � they also show that many groups have evolved to the point that gas contained within individual galaxies has been distributed throughout the group . � in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . � however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity , and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact -

ray study of compact groups to date is that of ponman et al ( 1996 ) . ccording to this study, these authors combined pointed and survey - mode observations of a complete sample of 85 hcgs and detected diffuse emission in 22 groups . ccording to this study, they conclude that , when the detection limits are considered , diffuse emission is present in at least 75% of the systems . ccording to this study, when the detection limits are considered significantly , they detected diffuse emission in several spiral - rich groups . in these ccording to this study, the surface brightness is lower and the x - ray emission has a lower characteristic temperature , as would be expected given the lower velocity dispersions of spiral - rich compact groups . ccording to this study, the diffuse x - ray luminosity was found to correlate with temperature , velocity dispersion , and spiral fraction , but not with optical luminosity . ccording to this study, the last result suggests that the gas is mostly primordial and not derived from the galaxies . ccording to this study, the correlations with temperature and velocity 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) . \u001c if the frequency of discordant galaxies is inconsistent with the statistics of chance projection , it might signify the need for new physical theories ( arp 1987 ) , or for gravitational amplification of background galaxies ( hammer & nottale 1986 ) . \u001c initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . \u001c however , such probabilities were recognized to be difficult to determine reliably , because the a priori probability of _ any _ particular configuration of galaxies is also very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects , \u001c can meaningful estimates of the probabilities be made . \u001c the explicit selection criteria of the hcg catalog in principal makes this sample suitable for a quantitative statistical investigation of the discordant -

densities in large datasets like that of the sdss survey . in case of an overdensity at a specific distance , the stars will not only cluster around a certain spatial position , but also along a certain locus in the cmd .    the method we which field stars taken from the sdss data are added . in total we create four cmds , shown in figure [ fig : fakecmds ] .   the number of stars in each cmd is chosen to be the same , to make for a fair comparison .   the artificial cmds 1 and 3 contain a simple , single burst stellar population , located at different distances , so that either the ms and msto or the rgb and hb are prominent features .   the artificial cmds 2 and 4 contain two different age and metallicity populations , again with the cmds corresponding to different distances .    the detailed parameters of the artificial populations are listed in table [ tab : fakegcprops ] . from the sdss archives all stellar sources in a 5@xmath115   patch of sky close to the globular cluster m13   were extracted and a small fraction used to create the field star contamination in these cmds .   the remaining sources will be used as a `` control field '' population when fitting these background contaminated cmds .   the detailed parameters of the artificial populations are listed in table [ tab : fakegcprops ] . from the sdss archives all stellar sources in a 5@xmath cmds are used in these fits .     for example , the fits are done at three different values of the metallicity : [ fe / h]@xmath131.6 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.4 to probe the uncertainties .     for example , in the sfhs of cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhdist ] shows the resulting sfhs in relative sfrs and distance determinations .     for example , in the sfhs of cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] and [ fig : fakesfhdist ] show that the software succesfully recovers the single burst in cmds 1 and 2 , and the two distinct episodes of star formation in cmds 3 and 4 .     for example , in the sfhs of cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] we see that some bleeding of star formation in adjacent bins will occur even when the fitted age bins exactly match the input sfh @xcite .     for example , in the sfhs of cmd 4 in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] the input star forming episodes do not match any age bins perfectly 5@xmath15 & 14.38 , 14.43 & @xmath101.54 & 12@xmath15 & 0.019 + m 15 & 10.3 , 10.0@xmath16 & 15.37 , 15.0@xmath16 & @xmath102.26 & 13.2@xmath16 & 0.11 + m 92 & 8.2 & 14.6 & @xmath102.28 & 14@xmath17 & 0.025 + ngc 2419 & 84.2 , 98.6@xmath18 & 19.63 , 19.97@xmath18 & @xmath102.12 & 14@xmath18 & 0.060 + ngc 6229 & 30.4 & 17.44 & @xmath101.43 , @xmath101.28 & 14@xmath17 & 0.025 + pal 14 & 73.9 & 19.34 & @xmath101.52 & @xmath101.52 & @xmath1410@xmath21 & 0.035 + [ tab : gcproperties ]    globular clusters are ideal test cases for the sdss implementation of match since in most of table [ tab : gcproperties ] ; the mean reddening @xmath24 in magnitudes according to the @xcite maps in the target area for each gc is also listed in the table .     the gcs in the three top panels in figure [ fig : gccmds ] have metallicities of around [ fe / h]@xmath25 dex , and the gcs in the lower panels are more metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) . for the more nearby systems ( m13 , m15 , m92 and ngc 6229 ) the main cmd features that will drive the fits are the main sequence ( ms ) and main sequence turn off ( msto ) ; for the more distant systems ( ngc 2419 and pal 14 ) only the red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) are observed .     pal 14 in particular represents the case of a very sparsely populated system with high contamination from field stars .    in the following subsections ,    we discuss the results of applying match to these gcs in the four different modes described in section [ sec : modes ] . in fitting the cmds of these objects by the fits at the different distances , with the error bars showing the complete range of sfr values found .    the metallicity in a bin is the average of the fits weighted by the sfr , and the error bars correspond to the standard deviation .     by looking at the three intermediate metallicity gcs in the top half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] we see that in all cases match infers a purely old ( @xmath307 gyr ) population , as expected . for m13 and ngc 6229    we see that practically all stars are found to be older than 10 gyrs ; some bleeding into the second oldest age bin is always likely to occur , cf .   by looking at the three intermediate metallicity gcs in the top half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] we see that in all cases match infers a purely old ( @xmath307 gyr ) population , as expected . for m13 and ngc 6229   we see that practically all stars are found to be older than 10 gyrs ; some bleeding into the second oldest age bin is always likely to occur , cf .   by looking at the three intermediate metall dex and a width of 0.2 dex .    after matching each of the 4347 sc options to each gc and determining the expected variance in the goodness -

but only for data selection purposes for specific analyses within section  [ massbasedprofiles ] . � mass and dimm measurements are triggered simultaneously and the dimm integrates the stellar light for 36  sec . including processing time , this results in a mass and dimm measurement every 7090  sec . as the dimm ccd is used to acquire the target star , typically for more than 95% of the collected mass data a dimm measurement was taken within 60  sec . however , sometimes the dimm or mass computations failed to provide valid results . � this is in part due to data taken under cloudy conditions . � as the robotic system operated the telescope whenever the environmental conditions did allow a safe operation , a mass and dimm measurement every 7090  sec . as the dimm ccd is used to acquire the target star , typically for more than 95% of the collected mass data a dimm measurement was taken within 60 individual layer tss are shown in tab .  embodiments [ profilestable ] . for completeness  embodiments that table also shows the mean and rms values for each layer .  embodiments these data represent the statistical properties of each individual layer , but these profiles can not be considered as realistic or representative . in particular because the layers will not be entirely independent from each other .  embodiments for example , for the lowest mass layers , which are spaced close to each other , one might expect that shearing forces could cause interaction between these layers .    the other way to define  embodiments a tp is to compute the ts of the layers under particular seeing , isoplanatic angle and coherence time conditions .  embodiments for example , we looked for the typical tp for the @xmath18%ile of the dimm seeing , which is inverse proportional to the @xmath18%ile of the dimm seeing .  embodiments for example , we first identified @xmath20% of all dimm data with values closest to @xmath19 .  embodiments for example , we first identified @xmath20% of all dimm data with values closest to @xmath19 .  embodiments then , we compute the statistics of the mass data which are weighted equally , explaining the low mass seeing of spm .     the different altitude weighting is also visible in the selected turbulence profiles .     the spread between the profiles selected from the various @xmath25 percentiles is larger than the spread between the @xmath26 selected profiles .     as example , figure  [ t6profiles ] shows the profiles from 13n ( from tables  [ profiledimmseltable ] and [ profiletheta0seltable ] ) .     it can be seen that the difference between the 25%ile and 75% gl ts median values selected from @xmath25 is approximately a factor of 30 larger than in the case of the @xmath26 selected profiles .     as example , figure  [ t6profiles ] shows the profiles from 13n ( from tables  [ profiledimmseltable ] and [ profiletheta0seltable ] ) .     it can be seen that the difference between the 25%ile and 75% gl ts median values selected from @xmath25 is approximately a factor of 30 larger than in the case of the @xmath26 selected profiles .     again , the strong weight put on the heighest layers ( @xmath24 the only site where the agreement is worse is spm .     this can be attributed to the increased acoustic noise due to the trees surrounding the site , which affect the sodar measurements ( see @xcite for details ) .     it can also be seen in figure  [ sodarprofiles ] that the profiles obtained at the chilean sites are similar to each other .    their tps show that the bulk of the gl is located below 40  m and 60  m at tolonchar and armazones , respectively . in comparison ,    the northern sites start from a weaker ts at higher altitudes , but below 100  m they increase much stronger than the chilean sites . between approximately 60  m and 90  m , their profiles are crossing the ts of the chilean sites .    from the presented turbulence profiles we conclude ,    that the topography and surface properties of the sites dominate the optical ts over the lowest hundred meters above ground , which are the main drivers for the overall seeing .    the northern sites start from a weaker ts at higher altitudes , but below 100  m they increase much stronger than the chilean sites . between approximately 60 behaviour of the mass layers below approximately 4  km is anticorrelated with the mass layers at 8  km .    the 4  km and 16  km layer exhibit less pronounced seasonal variations at some sites , if any .    the 8  km mass layer ( @xmath28 10  km to 12  km a.s.l . ) at the sites falls closest to the altitude domain of the tropopause .    the lower mass layers thus trace the troposphere , whereas the 16  km mass layer ( @xmath28 18  km to 20  km a.s.l . )    the 8  km and 16  km mass layers thus trace the troposphere , whereas the 16  km mass layer ( @xmath28 18  km to 20  km a.s.l . )    the 8  km and 16  km mass layers thus rather traces the lower stratosphere . that the parts of the atmosphere below and above this altitude behave differently    it is therefore not unexpected .    we will discuss these two altitude regimes separately . a very low level ( few @xmath27  m@xmath29 ) .      these variations are opposite to what is observed in chile : strong ts in winter and weak ts during summer . at spm       the seasonal variation is not reaching into the 4  km mass layer , whereas 13n might show some faint seasonal trend of this layer .     interestingly , the behaviour of the 0.5  km layer does not correspond to the gl .      for example , during jja the 0.5  km layer becomes strongest at spm whereas its gl is weakest during these months .                                    both sites are not far to the pacific ocean and we expect it to play an important role in the ts . but their local terrain is quite complex ( vegetation at spm and 13n being not on the actual summit ) , not allowing an easy qualitative assessment of the ts behaviour . for the large scale flows it can be said that both sites are located in the flow of the hawaiian high which extends further south however , with more scatter than armazones . in the case of tolonchar � this enhanced scatter is in part due to low statistics during certain months ( see above ) . � nevertheless , the slope ( increase of ts with wind speed , marked as parameter @xmath34 in fig .  [ ncepcn2 ] ) is at the same level at all three sites . on the other hand , above spm and � 13n the ts remains at very low levels up to @xmath35 m/s and only the higher wind speeds show a trend towards stronger @xmath36m@xmath8 values . � in other words , for the same level of wind speed , the turbulence strength at the northern sites is only about half of what is observed above chile . � also the rate of increase is only half of what is observed at the southern sites . � we tested similar correlations for the other mass layers but these do not show significant correlations . � this confirms the findings by @xcite who showed a direct correlation between the 200  mbar wind speed and the total seeing observed at telescopes on mauna kea and la silla . � in other words , for the same level of wind speed , which rises steeply out of the sea , can be expected to show enhanced formation of atmospheric waves . � such waves can also be forced by differential heating patterns like the proximity of the atacama desert to the pacific ocean . � atmospheric waves are commonly thought to result in an increased ts . � unfortunately , such waves and their turbulence production can not yet be modeled properly , even though comparisons between models and observations show promising results ( e.g. , @xcite ) . � our results might indicate that it is the actual interaction between wave and jet stream which is driving the ts . � to investigate the typical behaviour of the ts during the night we computed , similar to the standard year , a standard night . � it consists of the median ts of all data collected during each hour after sunset . � figure  [ txcnnight ] shows the results for the sites . to avoid artefacts introduced by the seasonal variations of the times of sunrise and sunset , the graphs in figure  [ txcnnight ] represent the merged behaviour for the hourly medians computed with respect to sunset and sunrise . � we found that the curves computed with respect to sunrise and sunset match best when midnight is set to 5  hours and the similar to tolonchar , but at a lower level , is the behaviour at 13n and tolar .     we note that our wind speed measurements are unreliable at spm due to the site being surrounded by trees .     from these observations    and therefore , we will not try to interpret the behaviour at spm .    from these observations    we suspect that cooling of the terrain during the night is important for the decrease of the ts .    this is in particular the case for continental sites such as tolonchar and armazones .     from these observations    we attribute the constant ts at armazones during the second half of the night to increased wind shear . due to its much higher heat capacity and its better efficiency to carry thermal energy below its surface ( @xcite ) ,     the sea surface temperature of the pacific ocean remains almost constant during night time .     this certainly affects the turbulent fluxes within the air above and close to the ocean .     we therefore suspect the proximity of the sites of tolar and 13n to the pacific ocean as reason for the almost constant ts observed at these sites . the sites . � the correlations break down at altitudes below the sites . � the correlations break down at altitudes below the sites . � as was seen in the overall profiles , as well as in @xcite , the ground layer at all sites shows the strongest ts by up to a factor of a few . � this is not unexpected , as the mass - dimm defined ground layer covers ( most of ) the atmospheric boundary layer , i.e. , the layer in which turbulence production is dominated by the interaction between air and ground . � shearing forces are strong in this layer as the air speed at surface has to reach zero . also the ground might heat or cool the air above it by means of the sensible heat flux , introducing temperature gradients . � as was already shown in @xcite , the gl shows the lowest @xmath37 in the range of wind speeds between approximately 2  m / s and 8  m / s for the chilean sites and approximately 2  m / s and 3  m / s for 13n mauna kea . � spm shows a continuous increase of @xmath37 of the gl with increasing wind speed . � as was already shown in @xcite indicates that its altitude brings it into the regime of the geostrophic westerly flows which are probably better modelled by ncep and are less dependent on the local orography and therefore the correlation is higher . of optical turbulence in earths atmosphere . m. , skidmore w. , els s. , travouillon t. , bustos e. , seguel j. , walker d. , gillett

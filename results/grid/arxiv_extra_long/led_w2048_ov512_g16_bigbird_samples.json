design spiral structure ,<n> a new test is proposed , in which the resonance ratios of the lindblad resonances of a galaxy s rotation curve are used as a criterion for selecting galaxies with spiral structure so extensive that the cosmic microwave background ( cr ) is within the bright disk . the test is based on the following : ( 1 ) the galaxy has a rotation curve that has a resonance ratio of at least three times the canonical value for a flat rotation curve , and ( 2 ) for each resonance ratio greater than three , there is a corresponding galaxy with a spiral structure that is at least as extensive as the cr in the disk and within the galaxy center . for the test to be effective , it is necessary to have at least one galaxy having a canonical or conservative value for the resonance ratio  the results of a program to image and classify spiral structure in nearby galaxies are reported .<n> the images were obtained with the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys in the f606w ( @xmath0 ) , f850lp ( @ xmath1 ) and f814w ( [ oiii]@xmath2 ) passbands . <n> the goal of this program is to characterize the morphology and kinematics of nearby galaxies in order to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies . in this paper ,<n> the observing program is described , and the resulting sample of galaxies is presented , with particular attention to those objects that are  grand design '' spirals , i.e. , galaxies with clear two - armed grand design spiral structure . as a result , the following results are obtained : ( 1 ) the sample of grand design spirals is complete to morphological type  s '' , including s0 and sd spirals ; ( 2 ) there is a tight correlation between grand design morphology and hubble type ; and ( 3 ) a large fraction of the sample ( about 60% ) shows clear evidence for bar - like features  we present @xmath0-band surface photometry and structural parameters for a sample of 31 spiral galaxies .<n> the galaxies were selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to have at least one galaxy with a well - determined redshift , and to have surface brightnesses and sizes that are typical of spiral galaxies in the local universe . <n> spiral galaxies are thought to be the most common type of galaxy in the universe , accounting for about one - third of the stellar mass density . yet ,<n> their number density is very small , relative to that of the milky way or the large magellanic clouds , suggesting that they are less common than previously thought . to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies , it is important to study their structure and dynamics . in this paper<n> , we present the results of a study of the spiral structure of 31 nearby , early - type , actively star - forming galaxies ( a sample that includes ngc1275 ) . using high - resolution , high - s / n images obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst  the spiral structure of a sample of 19 two - armed , grand - design spiral galaxies is analyzed using a variety of techniques , including a kolmogorov - smirnov test , kinematics , and resonances analysis .<n> the sample includes barred and ringed galaxies , as well as pure spirals . in nearly all cases ,<n> the morphology of the galaxy is regular , with regions of dust and star formation in the inner disk and spiral structure in the outer disk . for most of the galaxies in the sample<n> , the ratio of the two main spiral patterns is close to unity , indicating that the two patterns are resonantly related . however , there are a number of galaxies in which the ratio is less than unity that show evidence for either barred or ringed morphology , or both . <n> the distribution of the equation [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio for barred spirals indicates that barred spirals are limited in spiral extent , while for ringed spirals it indicates that they are limited by the presence of an inner ring or bar . a correlation between limited spiral extent and the existence of a ring<n> is also found , although the relationship between the end of a weak this paper describes an observational project that examined 140 spiral galaxies , measuring the visual extent of their spiral structure . the purpose of the project was to find galaxies for which the corotation resonance of the two - armed grand design spiral structure was likely to be within the bright optical disk .<n> it appears that barred and ringed spirals statistically have more limited spiral extent than pure spirals , but the location of inner rings at the outer lindblad resonance places no extra constraint on spiral extent . we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of hi - selected galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 .<n> the sample is selected from the hamburg / eso survey of galaxies ( ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) . <n> the hi selection criteria are based on the optical depth of the hi absorption features in the spectrum , as determined from the _ galex _ and _ hst _<n> photometry of the galaxies . for the sample as a whole ,<n> we find that the hi properties of galaxies are similar to those of ellipticals , spirals , and irregulars . however , for a subsample of galaxies , we find a significant difference in the hi content of these galaxies : the hi in the disk - like galaxies is about twice as abundant as in the ellipticals or spirals . in the case of the disk galaxies<n> , there is a strong correlation between hi mass and hi surface density , which is consistent with a scenario in which the gas in these galaxies has been enriched by agn activity . the hi mass - to - light ratios ( h / l  we present the results of a search for early - type galaxies with redshifts @xmath0 in the southern sky .<n> we found a total of 16 galaxies with @xcite , which have luminosities between 0.005 and 0.13 l@xmath1 and reddenings between 0.1 and 0.3 , within the area covered by the usno - a catalog . for each galaxy ,<n> we have determined the redshift , the velocity dispersion , and the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy . <n> our results show that , in general , there is a correlation between the galaxy redshift and its velocity dispersion ( fwhm ) , with a power - law slope of -1.9@xcite for velocity dispersions in the range 0.150.3 , decreasing to a slope of -1.35 for dispersions greater than 0.3 . in the same velocity range , we find a correlation with the galaxy luminosity , where the slope of the power -law slope is -1.5@x<n> . this may be due to the presence of dust , or to the fact that the galaxies are in a transitional phase in their evolution , as a result of a merger event , it is shown that the gravitational collapse of rotating massive stars is accompanied by the formation of multiple arms .<n> the structure of these arms is determined by the mass of the collapsing star and the angular momentum of the accreting matter . for a rotating star ,<n> the mass spectrum of the multiple arms is similar to that of the stellar remnant , except that the angular momenta of the two arms are different and the mass ratio between the two is different . as a result , the total mass of a collapsing star is larger than that of its remnant . <n> gravitational collapse is one of the most important processes in the history of the universe , occurring during the early stages of the evolution of our universe @xcite . during the course of the collapse , gravitational waves ( gws ) , which are the result of the gravitational interaction between the stars , become important . in some cases , such as in the case of neutron stars in the early universe or dwarf galaxies in the local group , when the gravitational potential of the stars @xmath0 is of the form of a potential well , a large amount of energy is transferred to the gravitational field of the galaxy , leading to the collapse of the we present a new method to determine the relative orientation of the arms of a binary pulsar .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the phase shift of the electromagnetic field emitted by the pulsar as a function of position , and compares this measurement with the phase shifts of the components of the binary s internal electromagnetic field . as a result<n> , we can determine the orientation of both the two arms of the pulsar and their corresponding phase shifts . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in studying the dynamics of binary pulsars , especially pulsars which have a very short orbital period , i.e. , less than @xmath0 s. for a low - mass pulsar , such as the neutron star or the black hole , the orbital period can be as short as a few tens to a few hundreds of seconds , depending on the parameters of the system , e.g. the spin , magnetic field , etc . in recent years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of such pulsars and their dynamics , particularly their phase shifts @xcite , which can be of great importance for a proper understanding of the physical properties of these pulsars it is shown that the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 of a black hole can be expressed as a sum of two terms .<n> the first one corresponds to the lindblad form and the second one to a gaussian distribution , both of which can be derived from the classical two - body potential . as a result ,<n> the second term is proportional to the area of the black hole horizon , while the first term corresponds to an effective radius . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of black hole properties , especially in relation to the so - called  second law of thermodynamics '' @xcite . in the context of the second law<n> , it has been shown that black holes are  thermodynamically colder '' than their non - black hole counterparts , in the sense that their effective temperatures are smaller than their corresponding black hole horizons , and that the entropy of black holes is smaller than that of their counterparts . to understand the physical origin of this behaviour , one usually associates black hole entropy with the hawking temperature , or equivalently , with the keldysh temperature of a classical black hole . however , the classical hawking we present a new method to determine the orientation of the axial vector field with respect to the line of sight .<n> the method is based on the use of a fourier decomposition of the vector field in the plane orthogonal to the plane containing the axial field and the velocity vector . using this method ,<n> we show that the axial tensor component of the radial velocity field can be decomposed into two components , a vector component and a tensor component , which are orthogonal to each other . <n> recently , there has been considerable interest in the study of axial vector fields in the axially symmetric regime , due to the fact that this type of field may have important implications for a variety of astrophysical phenomena , such as magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , pulsar kicks , gravitational wave emission , etc @xcite . in this letter<n> , we will present a method for determining the orientation and orientation of a vector field along a straight line , using the method of fourier analysis of the tensor component in the radial coordinate system , @xmath0 , in the case where the velocity field has a non - zero radial component . for the purpose of this work , <n> we have considered two we study the effect of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) on the x - ray emission from the early - type galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> we find that the isrf leads to an increase in the effective temperature of the source , but does not change the optical depth of the dust in the source<n> . this may be due to the fact that the density of the ism decreases with increasing redshift , which leads to a reduction of the eigenfrequencies of the ionizing photons . <n> recently , it has been shown that early - types galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath0 sc , sgrs , and s0 galaxies ) emit x - rays which are more than one order of magnitude larger than those emitted by normal galaxies . as a result ,<n> the emission from these galaxies can be strongly affected by the presence of isrf in the host galaxy . in this letter<n> , we will study the influence of the ionization structure of the host galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) , i.e. the density , temperature and optical depth , on the optical properties of the sources . for this purpose<n> we will use",

maxwell - dirac ( emd ) equations @xmath0 , where the amplitude of the modulation is a function of the position and the velocity of the ho , as well as of the angular momentum and the time derivative of the amplitude . for a harmonic oscillator ,<n> the amplitude is proportional to the square of the radius of gyration , while the velocity and the position are functions of the two parameters of the potential , i.e. , the amplitude and the period . on the other hand , for an emd system the amplitude<n> is proportional we present a semiclassical derivation of the exact eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with an anharmonic potential .<n> the derivation is based on the exact solution of the hamiltonian in the semiclassical limit , valid to all orders in @xmath0 , together with a comparison with the results of a first - order perturbative approach . <n> the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) is one of the most important examples of a many - body system with a non - trivial eigenvalue spectrum . in its simplest form<n> , the ho is a linear combination of two harmonic oscillators , with their frequencies determined by the anharmonicity of the potential @xcite . for a harmonic oscillator ,<n> the frequency is given by the sum of two terms : a  harmonic - oscillator potential '' ( ho@xmath1 ) , which is a quadratic function of the frequency , and an  effective potential '' , a square - integrable function with a quadratic term in the radius of the ho . as a result , _ all _ of the energy spectrum is contained in the effective potential , i.e. , we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of a repulsive @xmath0-wave interaction .<n> we show that the ground state of the system is a superfluid , with a density of states ( dos ) that diverges linearly with the strength of the interaction , in agreement with the results obtained from exact quantum - mechanical calculations on a discrete lattice . in the low - energy limit<n> , we find that the dos are split into two sets , one of which consists of circle orbits and the other of which is of diameter orbits ; the latter is responsible for the bifurcation of the circle orbits from their unperturbed counterparts , and for the onset of superfluidity in the system . <n> superfluids have been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . among the various superfluid states ,<n> one of the most intriguing is the superconductor - insulator - superfluid ( si - sif ) phase , which is found in a variety of condensed - matter systems , such as high-@xmath1 cuprates , manganite we present a semiclassical calculation of the quantum - mechanical density of states in a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator with anharmonic couplings .<n> the calculation is based on the exact solution of the radial schrdinger equation on a discrete mesh , and includes the contributions of all periodic orbits . in the semiclassical result<n> we find that the shell structure is dominated by the two - fold degenerate families of diameter and circle orbits , although these are not the most degenerate ones . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.-w , 05.30.-d , 73.21.la , 71.27.+a in recent years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the quantum properties of harmonic oscillators ( hos ) , which are composed of a finite number of quantum mechanical modes @xcite . for a ho ,<n> the interaction strength @xmath0 is proportional to the square of the oscillator s frequency , so that its response to an external harmonic field is similar to that of a classical oscillator , i.e. , it oscillates in phase with the frequency of the field . as such , the ho is an ideal model for the study of we present a semiclassical theory of bifurcations in an integrable system consisting of three - dimensional spherical harmonic oscillators coupled to each other by a quartic potential .<n> the bifurcating oscillators are the so - called  tori '' , i.e. , the circle orbits of the harmonic oscillator and the tori on the other side of the oscillator . here<n> , we show that the semiclassical trace formula for the amplitudes of the circles and tori can be derived from the corresponding trace formulas for the circle and torus orbits , and that it is independent of energy and @xmath0 for all energies . as an application of our theory ,<n> we show how the stationary - phase approximation for the trace formula can be applied to the present system . <n> [ [ section ] ] the classical solution of the schrdinger equation for the motion of a point particle in a harmonic potential @xcite is known as the riemann problem . in this problem<n> the position and the velocity of the point particle are given by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical solutions of the hamilton s equations of motion , which are well - approximated by we have developed a semiclassical trace formula for the density of states of an anharmonic three - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator .<n> we find that its gross - shell structure is dominated by the periodic orbits of diameter and circle shape , whose interference leads to super - shell beats which explain the findings from the numerical hartree - fock results . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / + +<n> + + we have recently derived a perturbative trace formula @xcite for the semiclassical spectrum of anharmonically trapped fermionic atomic gases with a repulsive interaction . here , we have applied it to the three dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , which we have studied in detail in an earlier paper , and found that the gross shell structure of the unperturbed ho is dominated at low energies by the orbits of the three - fold degenerated tori and their lowest repetitions , whereas at higher energies the tori bifurcate , leading only to finer details of the quantum spectrum . in the present paper<n> we have extended the analysis to the purely quartic oscillator , for which we find a completely different result , namely that the interference of the circle and diameter orbits dominates we study the periodic orbits in a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential .<n> we find that the gross - shell structure of the quantum spectrum is dominated by the orbits of next - to - leading order in @xmath0 , i.e. , the diameter and circle orbits occurring in two - fold degenerate families . <n> this is in contrast to the situation in a spherical cavity potential , in which the famous super - shells come from the interference of the shortest three - fold degeneracy ( the triangle and square orbits ) . in this paper<n> , we consider a harmonically trapped fermionic atom gas in a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) harmonic oscillator potential of the woods - saxon type , and study the quantum - mechanical spectrum in the presence of a small perturbation . for this system ,<n> we derive the semiclassical trace formula of balian and bloch @xcite for the supershells , which we compare qualitatively with the results of the numerical quantum mechanical hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations for the trapped fermi gas . from the trace formula<n> we can then determine the strength of the perturbation in the hf potential  we study the effect of anharmonic perturbations on the phase space of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) .<n> we find that , in contrast to the unperturbed ho , the anharmonically perturbed ho has a phase space that is _ 2  _ 1  ( _ e-ik)/ , _<n> i.e. _ flat _ phase space , and that the modulation factor is proportional to the square of the energy density . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + ++ + + /- this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @xcite , where we have studied the effects of adiabatic perturbations to the classical motion of the ho . in that paper , we have shown that the ho can be described by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) of the form @xmath0 where the coupling constants are the parameters of the system of interest . here<n> we show that the coupled odes can be treated by means of perturbation theory , which allows us to derive the modulation factors for the ho system , as well as the equations of motion for the we present a semiclassical derivation of the density of states and the diameter orbits for a particle in a spherical box .<n> the results are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with ideal specular reflection from the boundary using a multi - reflection expansion of the green function . for a given potential ,<n> we show that the semiclassical results reduce to those of the classical case in the limit of large radius and large angular momentum . in recent years<n> there has been a growing interest in the study of classical and quantum many - body systems @xcite . <n> one of the most important classes of systems that have been studied is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , which has been the subject of much interest both experimentally and theoretically . the 1d bec can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where the mass of the particle is the so - called gaussian density of state , and the interaction is mediated by the particle - hole continuum . from the theoretical point of view<n> , it is well - known that the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) potential @x<n> . however , this potential is we derive a semiclassical trace formula for the spectrum of kepler s ellipses .<n> it is valid for arbitrary values of the angular momentum and energy , as well as for arbitrary radial and azimuthal coordinates . in particular , it reproduces the well - known result of balian and bloch for the spherical billiard . as an application<n> , we show that the semiclassical spectrum of the kerr - newman black hole can be obtained from the exact solution of the schrdinger equation with dirichlet boundary conditions . <n> [ [ section ] ] the classical kepler problem @xcite , i.e. , the problem of rotating a spherical body with mass @xmath0 in a black hole of mass @ xmath1 , is one of the most important unsolved problems of modern physics . from the point of view of theoretical physics ,<n> the problem is very interesting because it is closely related to the question of the origin of the radiation from the early universe , which , in turn , can shed light on the properties of the universe at the epoch of reionization . at the same time , from the viewpoint of experimental astronomy , this",

compatible nonperturbative approximation scheme , which allows us to check its validity . <n> pacs numbers : 02.50.-r , 05.30.-d , 75.10.pq , 11.10.gh , 64.60.-i in the last decade , the random field model ( rfim ) ,@xcite which describes the long - distance behavior of a system of @xmath0 identically distributed random fields , has generated a lot of interest , both theoretically and experimentally , due to its close relation to the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of string theory . among the many applications we present a model of superconductivity in which the critical exponents are determined by the running anomalous dimensions of the fermion fields .<n> this model is a generalization of the one - loop superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis - s ) model introduced in [ ] and paper iii@xcite . in the present paper , we focus on the case of an ising - xy ( xy ) or an xy - yy ( yz ) superconducting order parameter . we find that , for the xy order parameter @xmath0 , the superfluid - insulator phase transition is first - order , whereas for the yz order parameter the transition is second - order and the transition becomes continuous . for the sis order parameter<n> , there is no phase transition and the critical temperature for the superconducting transition is the same as for the normal phase transition . <n> the study of the phase diagram of superconductors and insulators is one of the major challenges in modern condensed - matter physics , as the existence of a new state of matter at zero temperature is a prerequisite for a wide variety of physical phenomena , such as high-@xmath1 superconducting and superfluid phases we present a nonperturbative renormalization - group ( rg ) approach to the description of supersymmetric ( susy ) field theory .<n> it is based on the concept of the effective average action , which is defined as the difference between the susy eigenvalues and the corresponding susy hilbert space . in this effective action<n> , susy is encoded in the properties of the _ threhold functions _ which are functions of @xmath0 , the number of _ eigenvectors _ associated with each susy state . as a result ,<n> the rg flow of susy can be reduced to that of the standard one - loop susy field theory ( np - frg ) without supersymmetry ( ss ) . <n> susy theory is a quantum field theory that has been extensively studied in the context of high energy physics and condensed matter physics , as well as in nuclear and particle physics.@xcite it is characterized by a nontrivial superpotential , a higgs scalar field , and a set of yukawa couplings that are related to each other by a number of axioms , such as invariance under we present a new formalism for the study of the superrotational invariance ( susy ) in the random - field ginzburg - landau ( rfim ) model .<n> it is based on the superfield formalism of the nonlinear sigma model ( np - nlsm ) , supplemented by a dimensional - reduction procedure that allows us to compute the susy correlation functions in the long - distance limit . as an application<n> , we show that the breakdown of susy in the rfim near its critical point is associated with the appearance of a cusp in the beta function of the order parameter . <n> _ introduction _ the supersymmetric ( sus)y theory has been a subject of intense study since the pioneering works of lindblad and landau@xcite , who first predicted the existence of a susy phase in a disordered medium . since then , susy phenomena have been found in a variety of physical systems , ranging from superfluid helium-3 in the @xmath0he - b regime to superconductors in the s - wave regime . in this paper<n> we present an extension of the formalism that we have previously used to study susy and we study the critical properties of the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow of the ising model in the limit of low reynolds number @xmath0 , where supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken at a finite ir scale and dimensional reduction breaks down .<n> we show that the rg flow exhibits a transition from susy to normal ( non - supersymmetric ) critical behavior as a function of the dimension of the perturbative parameter space . at the transition point ,<n> the critical exponents are found to depend on the spatial dimension in a non - trivial way , in agreement with results from numerical rg simulations . <n> _ introduction _ the study of critical phenomena in low dimensions has a long and successful history @xcite . in recent years<n> , much progress has been made in the numerical analysis of the nonlinear rg equations , which allow us to study the transition from normal to supersymmetric critical behavior ( np - frg ) , see e.g. refs . and references therein.@xcite in addition , the rr lyapunov instability ( rf@xmath1 m ) has recently been studied in the we study the critical properties of the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice , both analytically and numerically .<n> our results are in excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations and ground - state determinations . in particular , we find that the anomalous dimensions associated with the connected and disconnected pair correlation functions bifurcate at the critical point , and that their dependence on the spatial dimension is described by the same exponents as those found in the derivative expansion at the ( critical ) fixed point . <n> the study of critical properties in lattice models has a long history , going back to the pioneering works of bernoulli , boltzmann , thouless and others@xcite . since then , many theoretical and computational efforts have been devoted to the analysis of such models , especially in the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) gauge theory. in recent years , the interest in lgw gauge theory has grown considerably , due to its connection with the critical behavior of the 2d xy model@xmath1 , a paradigmatic model of critical behavior in the xy universality class , which has been studied extensively both numerically and analytically.@x we have extended our non - perturbative renormalization - group ( np - frg ) approach of disordered systems to finite temperature .<n> we have introduced a nonperturbative , supersymmetry - compatible regulator and a supersymmetric - compatible approximation for the  ultralocal '' cumulants of the renormalized disorder , which allows us to follow the supersymmetry ( more precisely , the superrotational invariance ) and its spontaneous breaking along the rg flow . as a result , we have been able to obtain a consistent description of the critical behavior of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) in @xmath0 dimensions . in this paper and the preceding one [ eqs . <n> ( 139 ) , ( 135 ) of paper iii ] we have considered the property of dimensional reduction and its breakdown in the rfim from the parisi - sourlas ( rf ) perspective of an underlying supersymmetry and its breaking . the objective was to discuss the properties of the ground state and the presence of rare low - energy excitations above the ground - state , known as  droplets '' , in disordered systems . to do so<n> , this is the third in a series of articles on the nonperturbative renormalization - group ( np - frg ) approach to disordered systems .<n> the objective of the present article is to extend the formalism to a superfield formalism , to discuss the critical behavior of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) near its critical point , and to provide a theoretical description of the associated critical exponents . as in the preceding papers ,<n> we discuss the property of dimensional reduction and its breakdown in the rfim from the parisi - sourlas perspective of an underlying supersymmetry and its breaking . in the present paper , we show that spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry ( superrotational invariance ) takes place by going below the upper critical dimension , @xmath0 , which we find at zero temperature . at the same time , the dimensional - reduction predictions are not violated , so that the model can be properly described in terms of dimensionally reduced effective hamiltonians . <n> pacs numbers : 05.70.jk , 05.50.+q , 64.60.de , 75.10.hk , 11.10.kk we use the principle of minimal sensitivity to determine the critical exponents and anomalous dimensions in the nonperturbative renormalization group flow equations for the @xmath0 theory .<n> we find that the flow equations are stable over a wide range of regulator parameters . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.rd , 12.38.bx , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk in the past few years , a great deal of interest has been devoted to the study of the flow equation for the renormalized ( _ i.e. _ non - perturbative ) ginzburg - landau ( ng ) equation @xcite@xcite . in this equation ,<n> the parameters of the ng equation are related to the anomalous dimensions of the theory , which are functions of the parameters (  cutoff functions '' ) of the resummed ng equations . as a result , one can determine the anomalous exponents , the critical parameters , as well as the dependence of the anomalous dimension on the ir ( infrared ) cutoff function and the regulator parameters in a systematic way . here<n> , we supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most important achievements in the theory of disordered systems .<n> however , in spite of its importance , it has never been rigorously implemented in numerical simulations . in this paper<n> we present a new scheme for the numerical integration of the equations of motion of disordered spin systems , based on the use of a derivative expansion in cumulants of the renormalized field , and we apply it to the study of griffiths phases of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model . <n> pacs numbers : 05.20.-y , 05.30.-d , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk , 02.70.lq , 11.10.lm the aim of this paper is to present a numerical scheme for solving the heidelberg model ( hem ) of spin-1/2 fermions , which is based on a derivative -

1980 s<n> , a new divisor appeared in the theory of canonical varieties , which was used to prove the vanishing of the riemann zeta function for the hamiltonian system associated to the jacobian system of @x jacobi polynomials . as a consequence ,<n> it was shown that the zeta functions of hamiltonians associated to jacobians of polynomials of degree at least two are vanishing . for the case<n> that the base is a jacobic variety we show that if @xmath0 is a normal variety g.d.c . , cm , and g. d.c.-cm .<n> if the base is not normal , then there exists a cm-@xmath1-cover @xcite . in this paper , we consider a natural generalization of this problem to the case of a normal base , namely , if the set of primitives of the base ( i.e. the divisorial sheaf of the action ) is abelian . here<n> we consider the following situation : let @x s be an affine subvariety of @x<n> . then there is an abelic subvariety , which is the union of two gorenstein subvarieties , one of which is normal and the other is cm . by lemma [ lem : flatness -

[ eq : spectra ]<n> , the energy distribution of this final parton parton - medium scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in the lbt model ,<n> all outgoing partons , both the leading parton and the thermal recoil parton , are recorded and are allowed to go through further parton- and medium - scattering in the subsequent time intervals .<n> these multiple parton scatterings are studied by monte carlo simulations . <n> the study of the parton spectra and energy - momentum distributions in a qgp is of fundamental importance in understanding the energy loss of energetic partons in a hot and dense qgp medium @xcite-@xcite . the energy and momentum loss of an energetic parton in a medium<n> is determined by the distribution of the energy of the outgoing parton @xmath0 and its four - momentum , as well as by the polar angle of the incident parton with respect to the direction of the medium s motion . as a result<n> , the energy distribution of a parton can be decomposed into two parts , one due to the scattering of the initial parton from the medium and the other due to a subsequent part leading partons propagating in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium lose a significant amount of transverse momentum in each parton - medium scattering .<n> the leading parton s transverse momentum distribution and energy - momentum density in the qgp medium can be obtained from monte carlo simulations in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model @xcite . in this paper , we present the first results on the transverse momentum broadening and the elastic energy loss of the leading quark and gluon in the lbt model . <n> qgp is a hot and dense medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . at the same time , partons propagate in a thermalized medium , which is characterized by a temperature @xmath0 and an energy density @x<n> . the energy density of the thermal parton can be larger than that of the hadrons in the medium . as a result ,<n> partons should lose a considerable amount of energy . to study this effect , one can simulate the propagation of energetic partons in qgp media , i.e. , in a large - scale monte - carlo model , called the light we study the propagation of partons in a thermal qcd medium at finite temperature and zero baryon density using a lattice - based perturbative qcd ( lbt ) model . in this model ,<n> partons are allowed to undergo multiple scatterings in a uniform and static medium with a temperature @xmath0 mev .<n> the energy and momentum are conserved during each parton - medium scattering and are included in the final parton spectra and jet - induced medium excitations . using the small - angle approximation , we obtain an analytic expression for the elastic energy loss per mean free path and compare it with results from lbt simulations of a single scattering . for a gluon with the lowest energy and in a medium at the highest temperature , the energy loss remains almost constant even at a later time . at a temperature of 300 mev and a momentum of 10 fm/@xmath1 , leading partons lose almost all of their energy along their propagation path , while thermal partons carry the same amount of energy as the leading parton , in the form of thermal recoil partons minus that of negative \" partons . <n> parton propagation in a qgp medium is described by the we study parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> we focus on the excitation of jet - induced medium partons in the qgp medium through the interaction of the propagating parton with the background thermal partons . in the lbt model ,<n> the energy density of the background partons is assumed to be much smaller than the thermal parton energy density . as a result<n> , the leading parton in each @xmath0 scattering is designated as the more energetic parton for further propagation and scattering in the medium , while the less energetic one is considered as the recoil medium parton that is also allowed to further propagate and interact with the medium in order to account for the back - reaction in the transport equation . <n> we find that the energy and momentum lost to the medium by the propagating jet will act like a source for excitation of parton - medium interaction , leading to the diffused shock wave in the shape of an elliptic paraboloid , instead of a sharp mach - cone as in the case of shock waves induced by other linear response theories or hydrodynamic simulations or anti - de sitter / conformal field we study the angular distribution of jet - induced medium partons in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .<n> we consider both leading parton and medium parton propagation in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at a constant temperature @xmath0 mev , as well as in a qgp medium with a constant density . in the former case ,<n> we assume a perfect subtraction of the background energy from underlying events if the initial propagating parton is not present . for the latter case<n> , we use a modified version of the anti-@xmath1 jet finding algorithm to approximate final hadronic jets with partonic jets reconstructed from final partons . within this model , the angular distributions of the reconstructed jets are found to have azimuthal anisotropy similar to that of the event - averaged parton distributions , but with a different angular dependence . as a result , there are more energy losses from the back - reaction than from the front - reaction , especially when the energy loss is larger than the initial parton energy . <n> the angular dependence of the parton spectra is a sensitive probe of the initial energy loss of a parton propagating in a we study the evolution of a high energy leading parton propagating through a qgp medium with a complete set of elastic parton - medium scattering processes .<n> we calculate the transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of the energetic parton as it interacts with the medium partons . during its propagation through the medium ,<n> the parton carries a net transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . due to the finite jet - cone size<n> , there is a finite number of soft partons inside the jet cone , which are subtracted from the reconstructed jet . as a result , the energy loss per mean - free - path is a logarithmic function of the initial energy . <n> the study of jet transport in high - energy heavy - ion collisions has a long and successful history @xcite . in this study , we focus on the jet evolution in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at a temperature @xmath0 mev and an initial energy of 100 gev as produced by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . within the framework of the leading - parton approach ( lbt ) , monte carlo we describe in detail the basic elements of a monte carlo model for the study of jet transport in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium .<n> the leading parton propagation in the qgp medium is described by a perturbative quantum molecular dynamics ( pqcd ) approach , while the back - reaction on the parton is treated in the framework of an effective lagrangian . to study jet suppression in high - energy heavy - ion collisions<n> , we implemented in the lbt model a complete set of elastic scattering processes between the leading and thermal medium partons , including thermal recoil partons and negative \" partons from the back reaction . in this paper<n> we present results on the evolution of the jet transverse structure , parton distributions ( fragmentation functions ) and transverse momentum broadening of reconstructed jets as a function of parton energy and propagation time . <n> jet suppression is one of the most important observables at rhic and lhc , revealing the properties of the hot and dense qcd medium created in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . for a complete understanding of jet suppression , it is essential to understand the propagation of partons in the medium , which we present a systematic analysis of identified particle multiplicities in pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev measured by the star collaboration .<n> the analysis is based on a statistical event - by - event analysis of the multiplicity distributions of identified particles in p - p , p - a , a - a+a , and au - au collisions over a broad range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle . in particular , we focus on the dependence of the measured multiplicity distributions on the centrality of the collision and the transverse momentum of the hadrons . we find that the centrality dependence is best described by a power law , while the asymmetries are better described by an exponential function . <n> one of the major goals of relativistic heavy ion ( rhic ) collisions is to search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition and the possible formation of a deconfined phase of hot and dense matter @xcite . at rhic energies , the energy density of the qgp is expected to be of the order of 10@xmath1 erg / c , which corresponds to a temperature of about 10 mev and",

dimensional lattice . more recently , it has developed into a fruitful area of research , with applications in many branches of physics , ranging from in this note , i discuss some recent developments in the theory of the exclusion process .<n> in particular , it is shown that the well - known exclusion process on the complete graph can be extended to a  weighted graph '' setting , in which each vertex is associated with a probability density @xmath0 and each edge has a probability distribution that depends on the weight of the vertex . as a consequence ,<n> one obtains a new class of models in which the probability of an agent acquiring a given amount of money is determined by the distribution of the weights of the vertices in the graph . <n> the study of exclusion processes has a long history , going back to the work of john hutchings in the 1950s and refs . @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been a resurgence of interest in the subject , mainly due to the development of artificial intelligence ( ai ) , which is able to model the behavior of a wide variety of physical systems , ranging from biological systems ( e.g. , cells , molecules , polymers , proteins , ... ) to the mathematical setting of lattice gauge theories ( see , for example , @x this is a survey of some recent results on the limiting behavior of certain discrete time stochastic processes on weighted graphs .<n> the main message is that the well - understood fpp process on the lattice and the complete graph can be viewed as special cases of a general  weighted graphs '' process . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is intended to be a tutorial introduction to the subject of _ limiting behavior _ in stochastic processes . in particular ,<n> i want to thank my advisor , stephen pankavich , for his encouragement , and the many other people at cornell who have contributed significantly to my education and research career . we consider a simple model of a public health epidemic in which a population is initially infected , and then the process of infection evolves over time until the whole population is infected .<n> the model is a discrete version of the  random graph with prescribed degree distribution '' model of an epidemic , but here we treat it in a  deterministic , discrete '' way . in this way<n> , we are able to derive a number of mean - field results , including a characterization of the time at which the onset of the epidemic occurs , as well as mean field approximations to the distribution of the number of infectives in the pandemic phase . <n> [ [ section ] ] in a recent paper @xcite , i showed how to model the spread of an infectious disease in terms of a _ social network _<n> @xmath0 , where the network is defined as the set of individuals in which each individual has interacted with at least one other person over the course of at least two weeks . here<n> i shall concentrate on the case of an _ epidemic _ , that is , a process of infectious disease that starts with a population being infected but then infects itself . we consider the complete graph geometry @xmath0 , with agents labeled according to their opinion on a set of random variables .<n> we study the  fmie model '' @xcite for this geometry , in which agents change opinion at random rates . in the fpp limit ,<n> the proportion of the population with opinion 1 increases with the number of agents , and scales with the square root of the size of the set of agents to which the opinion is assigned . <n> we show that the behavior of this model can be derived from the precise understanding of pandemic given by p. a. yule [ pnas * 98 * , 656 ( 1995 ) ] . as an application<n> , we study two new variants of pandemic over the graph geometry : the first is a  generalized '' yule model ; the second is a variant of the generalized  slave - to - authority '' model . for the generalized pandemic model , which is not a complete graph , there is an intermediate phase between the initial phase and the end of the pandemic phase , where the fraction of the total population with a given opinion is determined by the distribution of the random variables in the graph . we review recent results on the behavior of the deference model in the complete graph geometry , and the contact process on small -

coupling limit<n> the contributions of these bound states are proportional to the square of the coupling constant , and therefore they can not be considered as bound states . as a consequence ,<n> the effective mass is a nonmonotonic function of the chemical potential and temperature , with a maximum at a chemical potential of about twice the deconfinement temperature of the qcd vacuum . <n> recently , the observation of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of quarks and gluons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite has opened a new field of research , namely the study of the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the large-@xmath0 thermodynamic potential @xmath1 is calculated in the coulomb gauge , using the landau expansion of the effective interaction .<n> the results show that the ratio of the average effective mass to the chemical potential , which is known as the  landau parameter '' , can be expressed as a function of the temperature , as well as the number of colors of the quark , in terms of the coefficients of the legendre polynomials of the interaction , and are consistent with the phenominological landau argument . <n> recently , we have studied the thermodynamic properties of the hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in that work ,<n> we have considered the problem of the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the early stage of the collision , i.e. , when the collision energy is of the order of a few gev / c . from the analysis of the energy loss in the qgp<n> , it was found that the temperature of the system should be in the range of a couple of mev to a few hundred mev , while the density of the medium we calculate the large-@xmath0 thermodynamic potential of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the coulomb gauge using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .<n> we find that the qgp can be well described by a single parameter @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the quark mass to the debye screening mass of the qcd vacuum . in the limit of high quark density<n> , we obtain the well - known result that the quarks in a qgp behave like massless fermions , while in the opposite limit of low quark densities , they behave as massive bosons . <n> the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at brookhaven national laboratory has opened a new era in the study of strongly interacting quarks and gluons in the early universe @xcite . at the lhc<n> there is a strong evidence for the existence of a deconfined qgp in the non - perturbative regime , in which quarks behave as massless bosons while gluons are massive fermionic quasiparticles ( qpcs ) with a chiral symmetry . due to the large number of colors available at we study the thermodynamic properties of a system of two flavors of massless quarks at finite temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xcite .<n> we find that the leading - order corrections to the thermodynamic potential density and to the effective mass are of the same order as the first - order ones , which are dominated by particle - hole creation and particle - particle interaction , respectively . in the low - temperature limit ,<n> the two - flavor system behaves as a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , with the bec playing the role of an ideal bose gas . for small temperatures ( t@xmath1 ) and low chemical potentials , the system is described by the usual bec model , while at high temperatures the system can be described by a lattice qcd ( lqcd ) model . <n> the study of the thermodynamics of strongly interacting quark - gluon plasmas ( qgps ) is one of the most important topics in nuclear physics , since it is closely related to the search for the qcd phase diagram , and also to the physics of confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , as well as deconfinement . we calculate the thermodynamic potential perturbatively in the large-@xmath0 limit and the effective mass of the quarks by using fermi - liquid theory for an imbalanced cold dense quark system .<n> the temperature dependence is obtained by using the gluon self - energy , from which the contributions from transverse and longitudinal gluons are explicitly shown . for the two - flavor imbalanced quark systems , the effective masses<n> are obtained both analytically within the weak - coupling limit , and numerically within the rpa approximation . we find that , in contrast to the strong - coupling result , which depends on the chemical potentials of both flavors due to the static screening of the electric gluons at long wavelength , this effective mass is a consequence of the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat . <n> we expect that such a logarithmic dependence shall have important effects on the imbalanced qcd phase diagram at low temperatures and directly influence the properties of quark matter in the core of neutron stars . to better understand these effects , it is necessary to go further , such as including the gluons self - interaction and extending our discussion to the three - flavors imbalanced case . in this paper<n> we calculate a statistical field theory approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is presented .<n> the theory is based on the minkowski quantum field theory ( qft ) of qcd in the coulomb and lorentz gauges , which is transformed to a euclidean statistical field theories ( sfts ) in the presence of a confining potential . in this paper<n> it is shown how to turn the qft into a s ft , and how to construct the hamiltonian and the effective interaction , using the symmetries of the theory , such as gauge invariance , unitarity and unitarity of the energy momentum tensor , as well as the gauge symmetry of the interaction . as an example<n> , it is demonstrated how to calculate the free energy of the quark - antiquark system . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 11.10.kk , 11.15.tk the study of the properties of a many - particle system is one of the oldest and most fundamental problems in physics . since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study the statistical field theory ( sft ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature @xmath0 is transformed into a euclidean qcd theory suitable for studying the dynamical properties of a many -

de gennes ( bdg ) theory . within the pt approach<n> the equation of state ( eos ) can be written as @xmath0 , where the temperature is taken to be the temperature of the vacuum , and the chemical potential and the entropy are in this talk , we report on our recent results on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) of quark -

relativistic and is described by the relativistic dirac equation ( rde ) for the quark and gluon fields . at high temperatures , however , the relativistic effects become important , and the rder equation is no longer valid . as a result ,<n> the relativistic eos becomes non -

[ [ section ] ] consider the following problem : given a time - dependent stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , one has the following question : what is the best possible time to stop the particle ?<n> this is a difficult question to answer in general , because it involves a number of combinatorial and combinatorial invariants . in particular , it is not clear whether one can consider a situation in which the stopping time of the particle is equal to the time it would take the particle to travel from one point in the past to the other point in in this paper , we consider a class of @xmath0-optimal stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) .<n> these equations are obtained by solving a sde under partial observation . in the case of linear hamiltonians ,<n> the optimal stopping times are given by the solution of a hamiltonian system , while in the general case , one has to solve an auxiliary sd . for this class of problems , in the first part of this work , by using a quantization technique that is a powerful method suitable for numerical computation and iteration of conditional expectations , and by combining two special properties of our problem , which we call the induction property and the translation property , the following results are obtained : 1 . <n> we prove that this problem has a finite number of solutions , that is , it is in the optimal phase of the phase space . as a consequence<n> , there exists an optimal stopping time for all values of the parameters . 2 . by using this result , a computable approximation of the value function<n> is obtained . 3 . using this approximation , an algorithm for the computation of the optimal time<n> is proposed . in this paper , we consider the following optimal stopping problem .<n> let @xmath0 be the number of observations made at each time step . then , for any fixed stopping time , there exists a markov process that returns the value function at each observation . moreover , this value function can be obtained by iterating the dynamic programming operator associated with this process . in this work ,<n> we present a quantization technique to discretize this markov chain and we manage to overcome the difficulty of computing the conditional expectations that appear in the expression of the operator . we propose a computable , explicit and stable , algorithm for computing a numerical approximation of our value function and a computatable optimal stopping time<n> . _ keywords : _ optimal stopping , conditional expectations , dynamic programming , quantization , lemme s golden rule , competitive learning vector quantization ( clvq ) is a powerful technique that has been applied to a large number of problems in different areas of science and engineering , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . however , in many cases , one has to deal with partial observations of the data  in this paper , we introduce a new approach to the dynamic programming equation for partial differential equations ( pdmp ) .<n> this approach is based on the following simple idea : we replace the markov chain by its quantized approximation within the different recursions . then , the computation is carried out in a very simple way since the quantized process is generally not markovian . <n> let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional , parametrically - valued , random variable . in this case<n> , it is well - known that the expression of the solution of the dynamic program equation is given by the sum of two terms . the first one is the gaussian , and the second one is an exponential function of the position of the input , called the _ mean _ or _ variance _ term of the program equation . for the sake of clarity ,<n> we will only call the first term the mean , while the variance term is defined in terms of the first and second terms only . as far as we are aware , this is the first time that the mean and variance terms are defined in the same way for a hamiltonian - type dynamic program  we present a numerical approximation scheme for the value functions of the linear wave equation .<n> the scheme is based on a quantization of the wave equation in a finite number of grids , each of size @xmath0 , where the number of points in the quantization grid scales as @xcite . in this paper<n> , we investigate the convergence properties of this approximation scheme and obtain bounds for the approximation error terms . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ theo]*theorem * + + + [ theoree]*proposition * + in this paper , we study the markov inequality for conditional expectations of linear operators .<n> we prove that the law of iterated conditional expectations is locally log - normally distributed on the interval @xmath0 $ ] . in this case<n> , one has that the conditional expectation of a linear operator is given by the product of the expectation of another linear operator and the conditional distribution of the first one . <n> markov inequalities ( mi ) @xcite are useful in many practical situations , for example , when one wants to estimate the uncertainty in the outcome of a measurement , or when one is uncertain about the state of a physical system . as such , they have been extensively studied in many areas of science and engineering , e.g. , probability theory , statistics , mathematics , physics , computer science , and many others . the main purpose of this paper is to study mi in more detail . for this purpose ,<n> we start from the following lemma : given a system of linear equations , define the operator @xxmath1 as the operator that assigns a value to each variable of the system @x<n> . then , let @x in this paper , we consider a class of operators @xmath0 arising in the theory of quantum teleportation .<n> these operators can be viewed as a generalization of the classical teleportation operators , which have been considered in the literature under the name of the quantum - teleportation operator ( qbo ) @xcite . in the qbo<n> , one encodes the state of the sender and the receiver of a quantum state in a unitary transformation , while the sender encodes a classical state in the unitary transform of the receiver s state . <n> the main purpose of this paper is to study the class of qbo operators that can be defined in terms of a finite number of classical states . for this purpose ,<n> we consider operators that arise in quantum information theory as well as in the theoretical foundations of teleportation theory , and study the behavior of the operators as the number of quantum states is increased . as a particular example , for a qubit encoded in a superposition of two maximally entangled qubits we consider the case of a single qubit teleportation channel , where the amount of entanglement between the two qubits is equal to the product of the entanglement fidelity and the fidelity of the state in this paper , we introduce the concept of @xmath0-optimal stopping and we prove that it provides a good approximation of the optimal stopping time for the partially observed optimal stopping problem .<n> we also show that this concept can be extended to optimal stopping problems for binary trees . <n> optimal stopping is one of the most fundamental concepts in the theory of stochastic processes @xcite . in this problem ,<n> the goal is to minimize the expected reward when stopping at a specified time interval . for a given stopping time<n> , there is an associated random variable which is supposed to have the same asymptotic behavior as the observed value of the stopping time . under the assumption that the values of this random variable are known , one has the problem of minimizing the expected value of this value . by using the schauder fixed point theorem , this problem can be reduced to the study of the behavior of the corresponding markov chain , which is defined as follows : given the value @x , the system is expected to stop when the value of its corresponding random variable is equal to the value given by the stopping rule . if the stopping times of the system are bounded , then the value obtained by stopping at some particular time in this paper , we construct an @xmath0-optimal stopping time for the euler - lagrange equation .<n> the construction is based on a recursive procedure that involves the quantization grids of the hamiltonian . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to show that , for this equation , the error between the first and the second moment of the stopping time is of order one . <n> let us consider the problem of finding an optimal stopping time @xcite for a system described by the following hamiltonians : ( i ) the _ euler _ lagrangian , ( ii ) a _<n> linear _ differential equation called _ hamilton _ ( hde ) , and ( iii ) an _ ising _ model . in the case of the first equation<n> , it is well - known that the value of the optimal stopping times is given by the formula [ 1 ] . for the other two equations , in the past , exact results have been obtained only for very special values of the parameters of the models . when considering the second equation with the same parameters , one can not find an exact solution . in this paper , we present a new approach to the analysis of time - series data , based on the concept of quantization grids .<n> this approach allows us to study the error associated to the quantization of a given data set as a function of the number of points in the grid . as an application ,<n> we derive a theoretical bound for the error in the case of two - dimensional data sets . <n> _ keywords _ : error analysis , quantization grid , markov chain , multi - dimensional systems . +<n> pacs numbers : 02.50.-r , 02.50.ey , 05.20.-y , 89.70.+c _ introduction _ in the field of quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite , it has been shown that the error of an error - correcting code can be made arbitrarily small while maintaining a desired level of accuracy . in particular , the error correction can be performed in two steps : first , an error correction is applied to the observed data ; second , a quantization is performed on the corrected data . for a given error<n> , this quantization can be defined as follows in this paper , we introduce a new stochastic model for brownian motion .<n> it is based on the concept of a brownian bridge , which is a generalization of the well - known girsanov bridge . in this model ,<n> the brownian motions of the particles are described by a set of random variables , each of which is assumed to be of brownian character . <n> let @xmath0 be a brownians particle moving in a _ brownian _ potential , i.e. , a finite , possibly infinite , number of time intervals , with zero mean and unit variance . for any positive number of times in a given period of time , the system is said to be _<n> brownian_. in other words , there is an unbounded number of particles in the system , and each particle moves according to a deterministic law , that is , it moves as slowly as possible with the probability proportional to the square of the mean of the parameters of the potential . the _ <n> bridge \" , as it is known , is a special case of the more general _ bremaud bridge _ introduced in @xcite  in this paper , we present an optimal quantization scheme for the class of multiplicative and non - perturbative problems arising in finance .<n> the scheme is based on the hamiltonian formulation of the problem , which allows us to obtain the value function of the optimal stopping problem . as an application ,<n> we consider the problem of calculating the expected rate of return of a portfolio asset . <n> optimal quantized markov chain , path integral , mcmc , quantization 02.30.ik , 03.65.db , 05.45.mt in recent years , there has been a growing interest in quantization of a wide class of problems in finance ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in this context , one of the most important issues is that of optimality , i.e. , what is the best way to find the optimal solution ?<n> this question has already been considered by a number of authors in different contexts , see for example refs.@xcite . here<n> we will focus on a problem of this type , namely : given a portfolio of @xmath0 assets ,",

section can be of the order of the susy higgs production cross section , provided that the lightest susy particle is heavier than about tev and has a mass of about , or larger than , the mass of the sneutrino @xcite . in this case<n> the dominant susy contributions come from the superpartners of the quarks and leptons , and we show that these contributions can be significant in the case where the superpartner mass is of order the gravitino mass . the study of the properties of the superparticles produced in high energy collisions is one of the main tasks of present and future colliders , in particular we present the program for the calculation of supersymmetric contributions to @xmath0 production at the tevatron .<n> the program is based on the  comphep '' package . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . in the susy scenario ,<n> the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) plays the role of the higgs boson , which can be produced copiously at hadron colliders . as a result<n> , it is expected that a number of observables , such as the production cross sections of the lightest neutralino , @xcite , the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and the tau lepton , as well as their decay products , will be measured at the lhc . among the most promising observables to search for<n> are the neutralino lsp decays and the anomalously large @x <n> 1/@xmath2 ratio of the tau to muon anomalous magnetic moment . the measurement of these observables will provide a crucial test of the sm and will shed light on the structure of the theory . at the present tev scale ,",

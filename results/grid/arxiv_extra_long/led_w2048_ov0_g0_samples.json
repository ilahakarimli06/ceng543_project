[ fig_histo ] ) .   the most common explanation is that most of the galaxies contributing to the peak are barred and ringed galaxies .    the most common explanation is that the distributions of the values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio are graphed separately in figure  [ fig_type ] for three morphological classes : pure spirals with no sign of ring or bar , barred galaxies ( which may have a ring ) , and ringed galaxies ( which may also have a bar ) including galaxies with pseudorings .    the most common explanation for the low values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio is that most of the galaxies showing signs of strong interaction , . @@@@@@@@ so the rationale explaining why galaxies with bars tend to have less extensive spiral structure may be only a partial explanation @@@@@@@@ the explanation may be true often enough , however , to explain why there is a peak around 0.50.7 in fig . @@@@@@@@ the explanation may be true often enough , however , to explain why there is a peak around 0.50.7 in fig . @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral arms are exceptionally thin . @@@@@@@@ there is some irregularity in the emergence of the two - armed spiral . @@@@@@@@ it appears that there is a single spiral arm in the inner disk that leads continuously , except for a kink or cusp , to one of the two main outer arms . @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious connection to the inner disk . a short arm or arc emerges from the interarm region interior to the main arm with the kink . @@@@@@@@ the short arm is initially bright but quickly dims and broadens . @@@@@@@@ both of the main arms make a transition from narrow and bright to fainter and more diffuse in the outer disk .    _ @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious . m. , & magri , c. 1988 , , 95 , 607 hewitt , j. n. , haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1983 , , 88 , 272 hickson , p. , kindl , e. , & auman , j. r. 1989 , , 70 , 687 huchtmeier , w. k. , & richter , o .- g . 40709&ugc02885&&7.02&5799&(1)36210&ugc08058&anon1254 + 57&1.7&21300&(2)34330&ic1551&ugc00268&2.6&13204&(3)31292&ic0983&ugc09061&5.5&13204&(3)31292&ic0983&ugc09061&5.75&5442&(1)30697&ugc11473&&6.60&4651&(1)29476&ugc10104&anon1555 + 30&2.69&9992&(4)26472&ugc02339&&1.60&16545&(1)26472&ugc02339&&1.60&16545&(1)26472&ugc02339&&1.60&16545&(1)25571&ugc3883&ugc06754&3.64&7025&(1)25341&ngc5174&ugc08475&3.70&6849&(1)25341& d.&bic0421&ugca111&  &  &0&  &mixed&bpic0983&ugc09061&  &  &0&  &2-arm g.d.&bpic1142&ugc10055&148&10&32&7&multiple arms&bpic1237&ugc10621&20&1&71&1&2-arm g.d.&bpic1237&ugc10621&20&1&71&2-arm g.d.&b : p:&(4)ic2421&ugc05789&39&2&55&2&2-arm g.d.&bngc3347&&175&3&64&3&2-arm g.d.&bp&(3)ngc3381&ugc05909&75&20&17&6&2-arm g.d.&bpic1551&ugc05981&46&8&37&2&2-arm g.d.&bpic1551&ugc05981&46&8&37&2&2- 19&5&2-arm g.d.&srngc7738&ugc12757&70&7&52&2&2-arm g.d.&brugc1279&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1279&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1279&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1279&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1279&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1280&&96&14&30&7&2-arm g.d.&brugc1281&&96&14&30&2-arm g.d.&brugc1282&&96&14&30&2-arm g.d.&brugc1283&&96&14&30&2-arm g.d.&brugc1284&&96&14&30&2-arm g.d.&brugc12 .3&ngc2206&ugca123&20&67&0.99&.&0.58&.&5.4&(2)&&27&128&1.40&.&0.82&.&4.7&(3,12)ngc6177&ugc10428&23&44&0.56&.&0.58&.&4.4&(3,7)ngc6181&ugc10428&23&44&0.56&.&0.65&.&4.4&(3)ngc6181&ugc10439&22&59&0.79&.&0.65&.&4.4&(3)ngc2460&ugc04097&82&160&0.57&.&0.34&.&4.7&(5)ngc6412&ugc10897&10&53&1.52&.&0.85&.&27.2&ngc6632&ugc11226&27&42&0.46&.&0.27&.&33.1 07065&&26&54&0.61&.&0.34&.&6.6&ugc09107&&17&42&0.74&.&0.43&.&4.8&ugc09808&&7&45&1.87&@xmath64&1.05&.&6.2&(4)ugc10104&anon1555 + 30&10&75&2.20&n&1.24&.&0.38&.&5.0&ugc10837&&25&54&0.65&0.65&.&0.38&.&5.1&ugc11406&anon1906 + 42&46&71&0.45&.&0.65&.&0.38&.&5.1&ugc11453&anon1930 + 54&23&57&0.73&.&0.41&.&0.41&.&19.4&ugc11585&&15&34&0.66&.&0.39&.&0.38&.&5.1&ugc11695&",

pringle instability was found in simulations for initially axisymmetric tori @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ such complete axial symmetry may not develop in compact binary mergers . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ numerical simulations of compact binary mergers have not yet shown signs of the development of the papaloizou -

axis observers , eventually becoming linear for observers in the equatorial plane . for sufficiently strong gw signals from the inspiral phase , reconstructing the eccentricity of the gw polarization could provide information on the opening angle . with a large number of measurements , the angular structure of the jet could be mapped as well @xcite .     these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave @xcite .     for instance , due to the relatively weak change in gw polarization with angle , the gw polarization may only be identified for large ( @xmath112 ) angular differences , and/or for very high snr ( @xmath113 ) , making the utility of gw polarization limited .     these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the rino cooling @xcite may all leave their mark on the evolution of rotational instabilities and the resulting gw emission . further , \u001c if a hypermassive ( or supramassive ; see section [ subsubsection : mergerphase ] for their definition ) ns collapses into a bh due to either losing angular momentum or accretion , the rotational frequency prior to collapse provides information on the ns eos @xcite . \u001c this rotational frequency may be inferred from the gw signal from the rotating ns @xcite . \u001c * accretion physics *  because gw emission from massive stellar collapses can be produced by the accretion onto the central object following the collapse , the gw signal therefore can provide insight into accretion physics : ( i ) the mechanisms that transport angular momentum ; ( ii ) instabilities ; and ( iii ) interaction with the black hole . and to some extent the merger phase @xcite . for such systems with properties in a highly limited parameter space , it is beneficial to use a signal waveform template bank and perform matched filtering based analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the following section below we review the gw search strategies targeting the progenitors of grbs .    in the following section we indicate the prospects of such searches through presenting projected sensitivity estimates based on observational results with initial detectors .    in the following section the results of chen & holz imply that the sensitivity of externally triggered searches is greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same sensitivity increase was found by dietz et al . @xcite .    in the following section the results of chen & holz imply that while this increased horizon distance means that many more sources fall within observable reach , the actual number of detected sources will be decreased by the beaming of the electromagnetic ( or other ) signal , as well as the sky coverage of the available electromagnetic telescopes . on the other hand , � most compact object mergers observed by ligo / virgo will not be accompanied by observable grbs due to the small gamma - ray beaming angle . � for this reason , the last few years have seen extensive investigation into rapid follow - up search strategies for more isotropic , but more difficult to identify , electromagnetic counterparts . � follow - up searches aim to minimize the time between the identification of a gw event candidate and the start time of the observation with electromagnetic telescopes in the required directions . the time delay of sending a request for follow - up search to electromagnetic telescopes after a gw event was @xmath25tens of minutes for initial searches ( mostly due to the manual confirmation of event selection ) . � this delay will likely be reduced to @xmath25minutes for searches with advanced detectors @xcite . � the time delay of sending a request for follow - up search to electromagnetic telescopes after a gw event candidate will likely be in the @xmath25tens of square degrees range ( e.g. , @xcite ) . � this delay will likely be reduced to @xmath25minutes for searches with advanced detectors @xcite . � the uncertainty in direction reconstruction of gw this is an appealing model , because it suggests that virtually all ligo detected ns - ns or bh - ns mergers would have detectable optical counterparts .     however , finding these counterparts in the large gw directional uncertainty region would likely require a combination of powerful survey telescopes and follow - up spectroscopy , as used by palomar transient factory , and pan - starrs , or the future lsst @xcite .     this is an appealing model , because it suggests that in the case of ligo detected ns - ns or bh - ns mergers, the relativistic outflow from a grb central engine interacts with matter in the circumburst medium , emitting a long - lasting electromagnetic afterglow in a wide range of frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at x - ray and optical frequencies ( lasting from minutes to a day ) ,     this is the most likely candidate to be detected by the relativistic outflow from a grb central engine .     this is the most likely candidate to be detected by the relativistic outflow from a grb central engine , emitting a long - lasting electromagnetic afterglow in a wide range of frequencies ( e.g. , method that combines the significance and other information from the two messengers .     the location of potential or confirmed host galaxies of grbs can be utilized in gw searches to enhance sensitivity as well as in event selection or localization .     long grbs are found to occur in star - forming regions of distant galaxies , in accordance with their association to the deaths of massive stars .     consequently , the rate of long grbs is correlated to the blue luminosity of galaxies .     long grbs are actually found in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies , which are significantly fainter and more irregular than typical host galaxies of core - collapse supernovae , suggesting that they are associated with extremely massive stars , and galaxies with limited chemical evolution @xcite .     the distribution of short grbs seem to follow that of old ( @xmath75gyr ) stellar populations within normal star forming as well as elliptical galaxies @xcite , in stark contrast with the distribution of long - grb host galaxies @xcite , in stark contrast with the distribution of long - grb host galaxies @xcite .     it is highly unlikely that short and long grbs are drawn from the same underlying population @xcite .     the distribution of major directions in which gravitational - wave ( gw ) astronomy has the potential of advancing our understanding of grbs and their progenitors .",

5 ,    this review is organized as follows : in section 4 , the definition of a compact group is discussed , along with methods of identification and surveys that have been made . in sections 3 - 5 ,     the observed properties of these systems are summarized and discussed .       the results of the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) provided a new and extensive resource for the bias . \u0013 the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature .      in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used .      in addition , the galaxies in the catalog are not compact groups .     in addition , a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters .      in addition , attempts to rectify these problems have been made by hickson et al ( 1989 ) and sulentic ( 1997 ) .      in addition to this, however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups .     a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups .     in addition , rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters . 22 for the hcgs ; prandoni et al ( 1994 ) obtain @xmath23 for the scgs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ similar values were found for several shakhbazian groups ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian 1989 , lynds et al 1990 , amirkhanian et al 1991 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ also well established is morphological type concordance , observed in both the hcgs and scgs ( sulentic 1987 , hickson at al 1988b , prandoni et al 1994 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a given compact group is more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for a random distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the shapes of compact groups were first ” sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ for the rscgs , the figure is comparable : for groups of four or more galaxies , barton et al ( 1996 ) obtain a compact group abundance of @xmath34 mpc@xmath3 which leads to a luminosity density ratio of approximately 3% . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ their best -

resolution studies of individual groups ( williams & van gorkom 1988 , williams et al 1991 ) showed clearly that the gas is not confined to the galaxies . in two of \u001c three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . these results strongly indicate that at least these compact groups are physically dense systems and not chance alignments or transient configurations in loose groups . \u001c they also show that many groups have evolved to the point that gas contained within individual galaxies has been distributed throughout the group . \u001c in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . \u001c however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity , and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact - group galaxies . \u001c in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ( kent 1981 , wu et al 1994 ) . � pildis et al ( 1995 ) derived baryon fractions of 12 -

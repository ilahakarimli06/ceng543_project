      "reference": "we establish the existence of fixed points for certain gauge theories candidate to be magnetic duals of qcd with one adjoint weyl fermion . in the perturbative regime of the magnetic theory the existence of a very large number of fixed points is unveiled . we classify them by analyzing their basin of attraction . the existence of several nonsupersymmetric fixed points for the magnetic gauge theory lends further support towards the existence of gauge - gauge duality beyond supersymmetry . we also discover that among these very many fixed points there are supersymmetric ones emerging from a generic nonsupersymmetric renormalization group flow . we therefore conclude that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric lagrangian without the need for fine - tuning of the bare couplings . our results suggest that supersymmetry can be viewed as an emergent phenomenon in field theory . in particular there should be no need for fine - tuning the bare couplings when performing lattice simulations aimed to investigate supersymmetry on the lattice .",

third of the sample , making their statistics somewhat noisier than those for barred or ringed galaxies . ) the distributions of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio for barred and ringed galaxies , in contrast to pure spirals , are decidedly peaked at small values ( around 0.5 to 0.7 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the different appearance of the distributions in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig_type ] can be quantified by a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( cf . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ press et al . ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the probability that the ratios for pure spirals are drawn from the same population as those for the barred spirals is less than 1% ; the probability is just over 1% . @@@@@@@@ so the rationale explaining why galaxies with bars tend to have less extensive spiral structure may be only a partial explanation @@@@@@@@ . the explanation may be true often enough , however , to explain why there is a peak around 0.50.7 in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ fig_type ] for barred spirals but no peak for pure spirals . @@@@@@@@ a correlation between limited spiral extent and the presence of an inner ring can also be explained if , as is fairly well established , inner rings are resonance phenomena . @@@@@@@@ inner rings and pseudorings seem to be located at the inner 4:1 resonance ( cf . @@@@@@@@ combes 1996 ) , which is exterior to the ilr . @@@@@@@@ limiting spiral structure to the range between inner 4:1 and olr also decreases the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio . @@@@@@@@ other aspects of rings are neutral to the discussion or are problematic . @@@@@@@@ the location of an outer ring at the olr ( buta & crocker 1991 ) does not place an extra limitation on spiral extent , and so does nothing to decrease the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio . @@@@@@@@ other aspects of rings are neutral to the discussion or are problematic . @@@@@@@@ the location of the group .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ this galaxy may have a central oval , although the morphology of the spiral arms may contribute to the illusion of the oval . in the inner disk ,    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral structure is bright and sharply defined , with regions of dust and star formation .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral structure is very regular and winds through a turn and a half .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ in the outer disk , spiral arms are faint , smooth , and broad . one spiral arm wraps through considerably more phase than the other .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral structure penetrates to very small radius in this galaxy .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the arms are somewhat faint and diffuse , although they are lightly dappled with regions of star formation .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ ngc1042 .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ much of the spiral structure of this galaxy is faint , diffuse , and punctuated by bright knots ( thus resembling ic0211 ) . the spiral structure in the inner disk consists of two short , bright arcs .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the inner disk has very regular , two - armed spiral structure .    _ @@@@@@@@ abrupt transition from bright to faint after about a full turn .     _ @@@@@@@@ the spiral arms in the outer disk are still rather narrow and are not diffuse , in contrast to other galaxies with different arm brightnesses in the inner and outer disk .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ the spiral arms are exceptionally thin .    _ @@@@@@@@ there is some irregularity in the emergence of the two - armed spiral .     _ @@@@@@@@ it appears that there is a single spiral arm in the inner disk that leads continuously , except for a kink or cusp , to one of the two main outer arms .     _ @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious connection to the inner disk . a short arm or arc emerges from the interarm region interior to the main arm with the kink .     @@@@@@@@ the short arm is initially bright but quickly dims and broadens .    @@@@@@@@ it appears that both of the main arms make a transition from narrow and bright to fainter and more diffuse in the outer disk .     _ @@@@@@@@ the spiral arms are narrow and emerge from nearby the nucleus . optical disk .     the likelihood that the corotation resonance is within the optical disk can be assessed by comparing the measured ratio of outer to inner spiral extent with the value of the canonical ratio ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ) .    the test using the canonical ratio is not conclusive because of variations due to rotation curve shape .    it is also possible that there is no inner lindblad resonance . to counter our ignorance of the rotation curve ,     a test with a more conservative value of the ratio than equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] should be used ( here , an extra factor of two ) .     a few galaxies were found that have large spiral extent and whose corotation resonance radius is very likely to be within the bright optical disk . among the best candidates for kinematic study are ngc5829 , ngc6907 , ic0211 , ngc1042 , and ngc0132 .     a few galaxies were found that have large spiral extent and whose corotation resonance radius is very likely to be within the bright optical disk . among the best candidates for kinematic study are ngc5829 , ngc6907 , ic ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . , g. 1980 , , 81 , 198 dalcanton , j. j. , spergel , d. n. , & summers , f. j. 1997 , , 482 , 659 elmegreen , b. g. 1996 , in _ barred galaxies _ , ed . . m. , & magri , c. 1988 , , 95 , 607 hewitt , j. n. , haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1983 , , 88 , 272 hickson , p. , kindl , e. , & auman , j. r. 1989 , , 70 , 687 huchtmeier , w. k. , & richter , o .- g . a. 1981 , a revised shapley -

provides a theoretical framework within which such phenomena can be studied , here no such framework exists and one has to resort to studies of specific models in order to gain some understanding of the phenomena involved .    one class of such models is driven diffusive systems ( dds ) @xcite . driven by an external field these systems do not generically obey detailed balance so that the steady state has non - vanishing currents . theoretical studies of dds have revealed basic differences between systems in thermal equilibrium and systems far from thermal equilibrium .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with short - range interactions do not exhibit phenomena such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and phase separation ( except in the limit of zero temperature or in the context of long - range interactions ) @xcite .    in contrast , some examples of noisy @xmath0 dds with local dynamics have been found to exhibit such phenomena .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with , such as defect sites @xcite or particles @xcite . in these models � it has been found that macroscopic regions of high densities are formed near the defect , much like a high density of cars behind a slow car in a traffic jam @xcite . here � the phase separation is triggered by the defects . � it is of interest to study whether phase separation can occur in @xmath0 noisy homogeneous systems such as on a ring geometry with no defects , where _ all _ possible local transition rates which are consistent with the symmetry and conservation laws of the model are non vanishing . � recently , lahiri and ramaswamy have introduced a lattice model in the context of sedimenting colloidal crystals , where phase separation is found to take place without any inhomogeneities @xcite . in this model , there are two rings coupled to each other and particles on each ring undergo an asymmetric exclusion process . � the hopping rate between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 on each ring depends on the occupation at the @xmath1th site on the other ring . however , this model is studied mainly using monte carlo simulations and no analytical results are available so far . where the three densities are equal the model is exactly described by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian .    we note that the model not only has long - range correlations but has generic long - range _ order_. the mechanism found in this study suggests that systems with dynamical rules defined completely locally and _ a priori _ without respect to any hamiltonian , may have a steady state where the configuration space is sampled according to a measure that is intrinsically global .    we note that the hamiltonian also allows us to identify the analog of a temperature in the microscopic dynamics as related to the drive of the system ; for zero drive , that is symmetric diffusion of the particles , the effective temperature is infinite and phase separation is lost .    in the present work we note that a related but distinct three - species model has recently been introduced by arndt _     in the present work we analyze in detail the @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xcite and then generalize it to larger @xmath4 .    in the present work we provide the complete proof of phase separation which follows from the exact calculation of the partition sum in of particles of different species it is of interest to investigate the steady - state behavior in finite - size systems . � we have found it convenient to do this by employing a matrix product technique previously used to solve the steady state of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite . � however , in the case of three species the simplest form of this technique @xcite is applicable only to a limited class of systems @xcite . for the present model � we generalize the matrix product to a product of rank 6 tensors and write the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions � the paper is organized as follows : � the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species of particles has zero density . in section iii � we study the special case where the model satisfies detailed balance and explicitly write down the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions � the paper is organized as follows : in section iv we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as to the following rates @xmath9 the particles thus diffuse asymmetrically around the ring . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the @xmath12 case is special . here � the diffusion is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move . � the system thus obeys detailed balance reaching a steady state in which all microscopic configurations ( compatible with the number of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equally probable . � this state is homogeneous , and no phase separation takes place . � we now present a simple argument suggesting that for @xmath13 the steady state of the system is not homogeneous in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity the case @xmath14 � is examined . as a result of the bias in � the exchange rates an @xmath6 particle prefers to move to the left inside a @xmath7 domain and to the right inside a @xmath8 domain . � similarly the motion of @xmath ite . � eventually the system phase separates into three domains of the three species of the form @xmath26 .    in a finite system � the phase separated state may further evolve and become disordered due to

is instructive to first present the proof of ( [ psum ] ) for small values of @xmath54 .  embodiments this proof will then serve as the basis for the proof for any @xmath35 .  embodiments we start by noting that in calculating the partition sum ( [ psum ] ) , configurations with energy larger then @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) may be neglected in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity  embodiments we first demonstrate this for @xmath124 , although later we show it for any @xmath35 .  embodiments the contribution to the partition sum from these energy states , @xmath125 , is given by @xmath126

the partition sum can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the truncated partition sum of one of the @xmath5 sets of configurations . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we proceed to calculate @xmath136 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done by considering all the possible energy excitations with energy less than @xmath131 above one ground state . consider a specific domain boundary , say @xmath17 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 at this boundary can be created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath6 particles into the @xmath6 domain ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an @xmath6 particle moving into the @xmath7 domain is considered as a walker . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the excitation energy increases linearly with the distance the walker has moved . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 is created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is

5 ,   the observed properties of these systems are summarized and discussed .   in sections 6 and 7 focus mainly on interpretation of the observations , and on implications of these results .    in section 7 , the results of all work on compact groups of galaxies can not possibly be discussed in this short paper , although an attempt is made to touch upon most current topics .    in section 7 , the results of all work on compact groups 170 triplets , 33 quartets , and 2 quintets . � unfortunately , the sample received little follow - up study . � sulentic ( 1983 ) re - examined the 35 rose groups which contain four or more galaxies and found that only a third actually satisfied the selection criteria . � this is testimony to the difficulty of visual searches . � a more fundamental problem is that the fixed magnitude limit in the selection criteria makes the sample susceptible to strong distance - dependent biases .    in an attempt to reduce such effects , hickson ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) adopted a relative magnitude criterion , selecting systems of four or more galaxies whose magnitudes differ by less than 3.0 . � a distance independent ( to first order ) compactness criterion was employed : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean surface brightness of the group calculated by distributing the flux of the member galaxies over the smallest circular area containing their geometric centers . to avoid including the cores of rich clusters , hickson ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) adopted a relative magnitude criterion , selecting systems of four or more galaxies whose magnitudes differ by less than 3.0 . � a distance independent ( to first order ) compactness criterion was employed : @x contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . � in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used . � attempts to rectify these problems have been made by hickson et al ( 1989 ) and sulentic ( 1997 ) . � however , it should be emphasized that changes , such as using photometric magnitudes in the selection criteria , are not corrections to the catalog , but are actually the imposition of _ additional _ a postiori selection criteria . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the new criteria are applied only to the visually - selected hcg catalog and not to the entire sky . � because of the difficulty of identifying faint groups , the hcg catalog starts to become significantly incomplete at an integrated magnitude of about 13 ( hickson et al 1989 , sulentic & rabaa 1994 ) . a more subtle effect results from the difficulty of recognizing low - surface - brightness groups . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the new criteria are applied only to ski 1995 ) . � an alternative approach is to identify groups of galaxies from redshift information , as was first done by humason et al ( 1956 ) . with the advent of large - scale redshift surveys , � it has become possible to identify a reasonably - large sample of compact groups in this way . � barton et al ( 1996 ) have compiled a catalog of 89 redshift - selected compact groups ( rscgs ) found by means of a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey . � galaxies having projected separations of @xmath8 kpc or less and line - of - sight velocity differences of 1000 km s@xmath3 or less are connected and the sets of connected galaxies constitute the groups . the numerical values were chosen to best match the characteristics of the hcg sample , and indeed , many of those rscgs that have at least four members are also hcgs . � there are some significant differences , however : because foreground and background galaxies are automatically eliminated by the velocity selection criteria , this technique is more effective at finding groups in regions of higher galaxy density , which would fail the hcg isolation criterion . � this criterion requires that the distance to the bias .     the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature .     the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) .    the hcgs are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters .     this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion .     the hcgs are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters .     this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion .      however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups .    a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups .    a recent study by rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters .     a number of studies of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( vennik et al importance to the question of the physical nature of compact groups , discussed below in section 6 .    in addition , many independent studies have found significant differences between galaxies in compact groups and those in other environments .    these are examined in section 5 .   in addition , the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , burbidge & sargent 1971 , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters . however , because of the small number of galaxies , estimates of the space velocities and physical separations of galaxies in individual groups are highly uncertain .    in addition , the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass -

to - light ratio of @xmath16 ( solar units ) for the hcgs . � similar values were found for several shakhbazian groups ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian 1989 , lynds et al 1990 , amirkhanian et al 1991 ) . � since the mass - to - light ratios of individual hcg galaxies is on the order of @xmath17 ( rubin et al 1991 ) , the galaxies appear to contain only @xmath18% of the total mass . � the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . � if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . � if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . � the shapes of compact groups were first investigated by arp ( 1973 ) who concluded that galaxy `` chains '' were unusually predominant . however , rose ( 1977 ) determined noticed in visual searches \u001c . it will be interesting to see if these results are confirmed by studies of groups found by automated searches . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if the intrinsic shapes of compact groups are related to their formation process , one might expect to see a relationship between the orientation angle of a group and the environment . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ palumbo et al ( 1993 ) examined the environments of the hcgs , and found that the orientations of the major axes of the groups were consistent with an isotropic distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if compact groups are not simply projection effects , they might be expected to show a centrally - concentrated surface density profile , as is seen in clusters of galaxies . although the number of galaxies in individual compact groups is small , with a large sample it is possible to estimate a mean profile . by scaling and superimposing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the hcgs , hickson et al ( 1984 ) found evidence for central concentration . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ mendes de oliveira & girard ( 1994 ) , using a similar analysis , concluded that the mean surface density profile is consistent with a king ( 1962 ) model with typical core radius of 15@xmath19 kpc . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ most recently , montoya et al ( 1996 ) have analyzed the profiles of the 42 hcg 22 for the hcgs ; prandoni et al ( 1994 ) obtain @xmath23 for the scgs . � both these values are substantially lower than those found for field galaxy samples ( @xmath24 , gisler 1980 , nilson 1973 ) . � also well established is morphological type concordance , observed in both the hcgs and scgs ( sulentic 1987 , hickson at al 1988b , prandoni et al 1994 ) . � a given compact group is more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for a random distribution . � white ( 1990 ) has pointed out that such concordance could result from a correlation of morphological type with some other property of the group . � the strongest such correlation found to date is between morphological type and velocity dispersion ( hickson et al 1988b ) . � as figure 3 shows , groups with higher velocity dispersions contain fewer late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies . � they also tend to contain fewer late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies . � they also tend to be more luminous . � the importance of velocity dispersion , in addition to local in their study ,  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) and rubin et al ( 1991 ) observed 12 hcg elliptical galaxies and detected nuclear emission in 11 of them .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this high fraction suggests that interactions and mergers may be supplying gas to these galaxies .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this idea received independent support from radio observations in which neutral hydrogen emission was detected in three compact groups which contain only elliptical galaxies ( huchtmeier 1994 ) .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) found that elliptical galaxies in compact groups tend to have lower internal velocity dispersions than do ellipticals in other environments having the same effective radii , absolute magnitudes and colors .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that they therefore do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other elliptical galaxies .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies that have `` disky '' or irregular isophotes tend to have lower velocity dispersion .  sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) argued that this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies - sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � obtained a luminosity function for hcg galaxies similar to that of field galaxies . � however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . � for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . � because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . � redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . � the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . � their best - fit luminosity function is deficient in faint galaxies , although a normal field - galaxy luminosity function is not excluded .  � redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . 1991 ) , particularly at the faint end , but it is not evident that the bias is sufficient to account for the apparent faint - galaxy deficit . � on the other hand , the small sample used by ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) may not be representative of compact groups in general . � hickson ( 1997 ) points out that the ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) sample has a spiral fraction of 0.60 , substantially higher than that of the whole hcg catalogue , and contains 7 of the 16 hcgs found to be in a high density environment by palumbo et al ( 1995 ) . � this suggests that the their sample has more than the usual amount of field galaxy contamination . � hickson ( 1994 ) , note that the faint galaxies form a more extended distribution than do the brighter galaxies . � thus they may be a dynamically distinct component , or simply unrelated field galaxies . � on the other hand , the redshift - selected rscg sample also shows mild evidence for a faint galaxy deficiency . � this suggests that the their sample has more than the usual amount of field galaxy contamination . � de carvalho et al ( 1994 ) , note that the faint galaxies form a more extended distribution than do a ratio of 3.3% . � for the rscgs , the figure is comparable : for groups of four or more galaxies , barton et al ( 1996 ) obtain a compact group abundance of @xmath34 mpc@xmath3 which leads to a luminosity density ratio of approximately 3% . � these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . � evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . � maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . � evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . � maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � compact groups , with their high galaxy density and evident signs of galaxy interaction should be ideal systems in which to study such effects . � many hcgs do error . � analysis of improved data ( eg . allam et al 1996 ) should soon resolve questions about the identifications and infrared fluxes . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � zepf ( 1993 ) compared the ratio of 60 @xmath35 m to 100 @xmath35 m fluxes of compact group galaxies with those of isolated galaxies and also with those of galaxies believed to be currently merging . � he found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated spirals it originates in the disk . � if this is also true for the infrared flux , there must be an enhancement inwards toward the nucleus , resulting in enhanced star formation in the nuclear region , and possibly fueling an active nucleus . � although there is a clear example of tidal interaction stimulating disk radio emission in at least one compact group ( menon 1995a ) , statistical evidence for a link between interactions and radio emission in compact groups is only now accumulating . � if interactions are stimulating nuclear radio emission , one would expect the radio luminosity to be correlated with some index describing the degree of interaction such as the projected distance to the nearest neighbor . � evidence in support of this was found by vettolani & gregorini ( 1988 ) who observed that early - type galaxies which have a high ratio of radio - to - optical emission show an excess of nearby neighbors . � a similar effect was observed by malumian ( 1996 ) for spiral galaxies in groups . � examining compact group galaxies , menon ( 1992 ) found that elliptical and s0 galaxies detected at a wavelength of 20 cm had closer neighbors than the undetected galaxies . � the effect was not found for spiral galaxies , but if one considers only the detected galaxies , there is a significant correlation between radio - to - optical luminosity and nearest neighbor distance for both early and late type galaxies ( al ( 1980 ) although these authors made no distinction between elliptical and spiral galaxies . � it is difficult to imagine any explanation for this result in which the compact group is not a true physical system . � it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . � it would appear that stars stripped from galaxies by tidal forces should accumulate in the potential well of the group . and may be detectable as diffuse light . in an early photographic study , rose ( 1979 ) found no evidence for diffuse light in his groups , and was lead to the conclusion that most of his groups must be transient configurations . � however , bergvall et al ( 1981 ) were successful in detecting ionized gas and a common halo around a compact quartet of interacting early - type galaxies , and evidence for a common halo in vv 172 was reported by sulentic & lorre ( 1983 ) . � diffuse light can clearly be seen in hcg 94 , and has been found in hcg 94 , and has been found in hcg 55 ( sulentic 1987 ) , but pildis et al ( 1995b radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . � high - resolution studies of individual groups ( williams & van gorkom 1988 , williams et al 1991 ) showed clearly that the gas is not confined to the galaxies . in two of � high - resolution studies of the three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . these results strongly indicate that at least these compact groups are physically dense systems and not chance alignments or transient configurations in loose groups . � they also show that many groups have evolved to the point that gas contained within individual galaxies has been distributed throughout the group . � in contrast to the hi results , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . � however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity , and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact - group galaxies . � further co studies , currently in progress , should soon settle this question . � x - ray pointed rosat observations revealed massive hydrogen envelopes surrounding the ngc 2300 group , a bright elliptical - spiral pair with two fainter members ( mulchaey et al 1993 ) , and hcg 62 , a compact quartet of early - type galaxies ( ponman & bertram 1993 ) , and showed that these systems are dominated by dark matter . � subsequent investigations detected x - rays from 18 additional compact groups , either from individual galaxies , or from diffuse gas ( ebeling et al 1994 , pildis et al 1995a , sarraco & ciliegi 1995 , sulentic et al 1995 ) . � these studies showed that the physical properties of individual systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . � moreover , the detected compact groups all contained a majority of early - type galaxies . � no spiral - rich groups were detected ( although mulchaey et al 1996b pointed out that they might be found from qso absorption spectra ) . � these studies showed that the physical properties of individual systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . � pildis et al ( 1995 ) derived baryon fractions of 12 - 19% . � davis et al ( 1996 ) obtains 10 - 16% for the ngc 2300 group . these are comparable to the fractions found for poor clusters ( dellantonio et al ( 1995 ) and are about half the typical values found for rich clusters � . however , the derived baryon fraction depends sensitively on the radius within which it is measured and on the assumed background level ( henriksen & mamon 1994 ) . � both the total mass , which is dominated by dark matter , and the gas mass continue to increase with radius . consequently , both the baryon fraction and the gas fraction are poorly determined . � the contribution of compact groups to the x - ray luminosity function has been estimated by pbeb , who find that on the order of 4% of the total luminosity in the range @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 comes from hcgs . � this is higher than the contribution of hcg galaxies to the local optical luminosity density estimated at 0.8% by mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) , but it is comparable to the 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) . \u001c if the frequency of discordant galaxies is inconsistent with the statistics of chance projection , it might signify the need for new physical theories ( arp 1987 ) , or for gravitational amplification of background galaxies ( hammer & nottale 1986 ) . \u001c initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . \u001c however , such probabilities were recognized to be difficult to determine reliably , because the a priori probability of _ any _ particular configuration of galaxies is also very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects , \u001c can meaningful estimates of the probabilities be made . \u001c the explicit selection criteria of the hcg catalog in principal makes this sample suitable for a quantitative statistical investigation of the discordant - redshift question . sulentic ( 1987 ) \u001c first concluded that the number of discordant galaxies is too large to explain by chance . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of ( kent 1981 , wu et al 1994 ) . physical binaries ( mamon 1995 ) . \u001c the high fraction of hcgs showing diffuse x - ray emission is very strong evidence that a large fraction of these systems are physically dense , and are not transient configurations or projection effects . although the exact numbers are not final , due to the faintness of the sources and the problems of contamination by sources associated with the individual galaxies , it seems evident that many groups are dense bound systems .  embodiments the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties , and the fact that the x - ray properties of compact groups are not inconsistent with those of clusters reinforces this conclusion .  embodiments ostriker et al ( 1995 ) have argued that the relatively low x - ray luminosities of compact groups might not be due to a low gas fraction , but instead could be understood if the groups are filaments seen in projection ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . however , ponman et al ( 1996 ) point out that in order to explain even the fainter compact groups , gas temperatures @xmath40 kev and densities @xmath41 @xmath42 would be required . these appear to be ruled out by both observations ( briel & henry 1995 ) and simulations ( diaferio et al 50 and @xmath51 . � here we have neglected a small edge contribution that is unimportant for small values of @xmath52 ( walke and mamon s case 3 ) . � this gives f(x , n ) = n^2 x^2n-2 now , an observer would infer a galaxy space density that is higher by a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 n^2 x^2n-5 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor of 12.0 for triplets ( or quartets containing a physical binary ) , 3.2 for true quartets fit in this picture ? \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ recent studies ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian et al 1988 , 1991 , amirkhanian 1989 , kodaira et al 1988 - 91 , stoll et al 1993 - 1996 ) show that these objects are typically compact clusters or groups of early - type galaxies . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ although the systems were selected on the basis of red colors and compact appearance of their galaxies , both of these factors result from their large distances because k - corrections and contrast effects become significant . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the galaxies are in fact relatively normal , although luminous ( del olmo et al 1995 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ however , the number of blue ( gas rich ) galaxies in these systems does seem to be very small . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus it appears the shakhbazian groups are mostly small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if the groups are dynamically bound , galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times ( carnevali et al 1981 , ishizawa et al 1983 , barnes 1985 , ishizawa 1986 , mamon 1987 , 1990 , zheng et who found that the luminosities of first - ranked galaxies were consistent with a single luminosity distribution for all group galaxies . of course � this may just mean that in small groups the first - ranked galaxy is not necessarily the most evolved . � rather , one should ask if _ any _ galaxies in compact groups show indications of merging . � the relative paucity of merging galaxies in compact groups was first noted by tikhonov ( 1987 ) , from a visual inspection of optical images . � zepf & whitmore ( 1991 ) realized that elliptical galaxies formed by recent mergers of gas - rich systems should have bluer colors than normal . � examining the hcgs , they found only a small enhancement in the fraction of early - type galaxies having blue colors , a conclusion reinforced by an independent study by moles et al ( 1994 ) . on � the other hand , caon et al ( 1994 ) argued that the large effective radii of compact group elliptical galaxies is indicative of an origin by merging or accretion of companions . � zepf & whitmore ( 1993 ) estimated that roughly 7% of the galaxies in compact groups are in the process of merging . � this conclusion was based on roughly et al 1995 ) in which we find strong gravitational interactions . at the other end \u001c are lower density compact groups , such as hcg 44 , which most likely are in a less - advanced stage of evolution . � this picture is supported by radio observations : seyfert s sextet and hcg 31 are both embedded in extended hi clouds whereas in hcg 44 the hi is associated with individual galaxies ( williams et al 1991 ) . � it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time . � the hcg catalog includes several examples of compact groups containing both starburst galaxies and agn . � the hcg catalog includes several examples of compact groups containing both starburst galaxies and agn . � it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time . � simulations indicate that merging should destroy the group on a time scale @xmath54 that is typically an order of magnitude larger than @xmath55 , depending on the distribution of dark matter ( cavaliere et al 1983 , barnes 1984 , navarro et al 1987 , kodaira et al 1990 ) and by at least a factor of two , and may be underestimated because of selection biases .     if there is then the potential problem of producing too many relics .        a second problem is the fact that the integrated luminosities of compact groups are typically a factor of three to four times greater than luminosities of isolated elliptical galaxies ( sulentic and rabaa 1994 ) .    it is possible that interaction - induced star formation has boosted the luminosities of some compact - group galaxies , and that some degree of fading of the merger product is expected .      however , at this point it is not clear whether or not the relics can be identified with isolated elliptical galaxies .    despite these problems , a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    in this case , a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    in this case , a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have detected a luminous isolated elliptical galaxy surrounded by diffuse x - ray emission which is consistent with the expected end - product of a compact group .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have ai 1994 , hutchings 1995 , hutchings et al 1995 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these observations provide support to the idea that tidally - triggered star formation is a predominant factor in the galaxy formation process ( lacey & silk 1991 , lacey et al 1993 ) . in this model disk star formation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( schade et al 1995 ) , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath59 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ compact groups may possibly play a role in the formation of other systems . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . at the other end of the scale , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a unique formation mechanism . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one possibility is that they form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris ( duc & mir systems 5 - 10 times more distant should produce a non - negligible fraction of giant arcs .  embodiments studies of small groups may provide clues to the overall structure of the universe .  embodiments the baryon fractions found in clusters of galaxies appear to be inconsistent with a density parameter @xmath60 , unless the dark matter is more prevalent outside clusters ( white 1992 , babul & katz 1993 ) .  embodiments compact groups provide a means to study dark matter in such regions .  embodiments the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .  embodiments david et al ( 1995 ) argued that the gas is the most extended component ; galaxies being the most compact and the dark matter being intermediate .  embodiments they concluded that the baryon fraction approaches 30% on large enough scales , which is comparable to the values found for clusters .  embodiments the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .  embodiments david et al ( 1995 ) argued that the gas is the most extended component ; galaxies being the most compact and the dark matter being intermediate .  embodiments they concluded that the baryon fraction approaches 30% on large enough scales , which is comparable to the values found for clusters . What is their role in the evolution of galaxies and what is their role in the evolution of galaxies both past and present ? given the current interest and research activity in this area , it is likely that many of these questions may soon be addressed . \u001c it is a pleasure to thank the observatories of brera and capodimonte for hospitality during the initial work on this review . \u001c i have benefitted from discussions with many individuals , but i would like to acknowledge particularly the contributions of a iovino , e kindl , g longo , g mamon , c mendes de oliveira , tk menon , g palumbo , h rood , and j sulentic . \u001c i thank g mamon , a sandage and j sulentic for providing helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript . \u001c financial support was provided by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and nato . \u001c [ a]llam s , assendorp r , longo g , braun r , longo g , braun m , richter g. 1996 . _ \u001c _ astrofizika _ 117:39 - 82 [ a]mbartsumian ba \u001c 66:536 [ b]ahcall na , harris de , rood hj . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ 284:l29-l33 [ b]aier fw , petrosian , mb , tiersch h , shakhbazian rk . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 10:327 - 35 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1975 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 11:221 - 28 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1975 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 11:221 - 28 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1976 . _ astrofizika _ 12:7 - 12 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1976 . _ astrofizika _ 12:409 - 15 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1978 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 14:279 - 82 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 14:279 - 82 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ astrofizika _ 15 , casoli f. 1996 . � _ 314:738 - 44 [ b]riel ug , henry jp . 1995 . � astrophys . _ 302:l9-l12 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr . � 130:23 - 25 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 130:23 - 25 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 130:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 130:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 130:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:244 - 47 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:244 - 47 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:248 - 56 [ b]urbidge em , sargent wlw . 1971 . � 35:351 - 78 [ c]ampos - aguilar a , moles zky rf , burstein d. 1996 .

induced collapse of white dwarfs that accrete mass and angular momentum from a non - degenerate companion may produce the most rapidly rotating protomagnetars . ㅋ due to continued accretion , such white dwarfs will be rapidly rotating upon collapse , resulting in a rapidly rotating protomagnetar , and a strong gw signal . on the other hand ㅋ , the remnant of a binary white dwarf merger will likely collapse to a magnetar with a significant delay ( @xmath106yr ) , allowing the remnant to lose most of its angular momentum via stellar winds @xcite . ㅋ due to continued accretion , such white dwarfs will be rapidly rotating upon collapse , resulting in a rapidly rotating protomagnetar , and a strong gw signal . on the other hand example , observing grbs in coincidence with those binaries for which numerical simulations predict the formation of accretion disks would indicate a connection between accretion disks and grbs .  practition already , analyses of gw data from initial detectors targeting gamma - ray bursts have helped rule out binary mergers as the central engines of selected events @xcite .  practition * population prospects *  the populations of short grbs @xcite , as well as compact binaries @xcite , are highly uncertain  practition . the observation of gws from compact binary coalescences could be an effective way of determining the source population . due to the very large field - of - view of gw detectors and the very weak beaming of gw emission  practition , they can be used efficiently to locate practically all sources within their well - determined horizon distance of hundreds of megaparsecs .  practition as source distances can also be determined using gws ( see next subsection ) , the binary coalescence population could also be mapped as a function of redshift , although only with the sensitivity of third - generation gw detectors @xcite .  practition * cosmological parameters *  the detection of a binary coalescence gw signal from an observed short grb could be used efficiently to of the inspiral gw signals in principle could be used to characterize the viewing angle of observed grbs @xcite .  embodiments the gw polarization from a binary inspiral depends on the viewing angle compared to the rotational axis of the binary . towards the rotational axis ,  embodiments the gw signal is circularly polarized , while the polarization becomes elliptical for off - axis observers , eventually becoming linear for observers in the equatorial plane . for sufficiently strong gw signals from the inspiral phase , reconstructing the eccentricity of the gw polarization could provide information on the opening angle . with a large number of measurements , the angular structure of the jet could be mapped as well @xcite .  embodiments these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave @xcite .  embodiments nevertheless , due to the relatively weak change in gw polarization with angle , the gw polarization may only be identified for large ( @xmath112 ) angular differences , and/or for very high snr ( @xmath113 ) , making the utility of gw polarization limited .  embodiments these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave w energy spectrum during the last few orbits of a ns - ns binary prior to merger can be used to determine the compactness ratio ( mass / radius ) of the nss @xcite . for these last few orbits of the binary \u001c , the gw frequency is at a high but still reasonably sensitive frequency for ligo -

torus systems the strength of viscosity ( and possibly the strength of other processes through which the torus loses angular momentum ) can be determined , as these are competing effects for angular momentum loss : the total loss of angular momentum can be inferred from the rate of change of the gw signal therefore can provide insight into accretion physics : ( gws from nss excited by , e.g. , starquakes , could be used to infer the ns mass , radius and eos @xcite , or potentially even the strength of magnetic fields inside the ns @xcite .     the detection of millisecond magnetars gw signature in coincidence with a grb would confirm their presence and role as the central engine behind some grbs .     further , the gw signature of millisecond magnetars may indicate their origin ( e.g. , typical rotation rates may differ for different mechanisms ; see section [ section : millisecondmagnetars ] ) .     advanced gw detectors will also be able to determine , out to @xmath121mpc , whether the progenitor of a short grb was a binary merger of a ns with another ns or a bh @xcite .     the confirmation of a compact binary merger would rule out the other scenarios in which millisecond magnetars can form , e.g. , white dwarf accretion - induced collapses , or white dwarf accretion - induced collapses , or white dwarf binary mergers .     the success of detection of gws from grb progenitors depends on the strength of the emitted gws , and to some extent the merger phase @xcite . for such systems with properties in a highly limited parameter space , it is beneficial to use a signal waveform template bank and perform matched filtering based analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the following section below we review the gw search strategies targeting the progenitors of grbs .    in the following section we indicate the prospects of such searches through presenting projected sensitivity estimates based on observational results with initial detectors .    in the following section we indicate that the advanced detectors will be @xmath122 more sensitive than initial detectors , the exclusion distances therefore will be @xmath122 greater , corresponding to a @xmath251000-fold improvement in achievable source rate constraints .    in the following section we indicate that the advanced detectors will eventually be larger , with the inclusion of kagra and probably ligo india .     in the following section we indicate that these improvements will further increase the achievable sensitivity of the advanced detector network @xcite , and will further improve signal parameter reconstruction ( e.g. , source direction ; @xmath251000-fold improvement in achievable source rate constraints .    in the following section we indicate that , @xcite )    for realistic grb beaming angles     , the beaming of gw emission from grb progenitors is weak ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for realistic grb beaming angles     , there will likely be more observations of gws from off - axis grb progenitors than gw observations triggered by grbs @xcite .    to help quantify the source population detectable with untriggered ( and other ) searches , it is useful to characterize the sensitivity of a gw observatory to a gw source with the so - called _ horizon distance _ @xmath123 .    the horizon distance is defined as the distance at which a gw source from optimal orientation ( such that emission towards the earth is the strongest ) and optimal location ( i.e. the most sensitive direction of the gw detector ) is observed with a given snr ( typically chosen to be @xmath124 for untriggered searches ; see also section [ subsubsection : extrig ] ) by a single gw detector .    for a gw source from optimal orientation ( such that emission towards the earth is the strongest ) and optimal location the number of triggered and untriggered detections of gws from grb progenitors would be comparable . further , even for greater beaming factors ( i.e. smaller opening angles ) , externally triggered searches will enable the detection of some additional , particularly interesting , sources . � the extra information in external triggers can be taken into account in the horizon distance by effectively lowering the snr threshold ( i.e. by keeping the false - alarm rate constant ) . � the results of chen & holz imply that the sensitivity of externally triggered searches is greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same sensitivity increase was found by dietz et al . @xcite . � the results of chen & holz imply that the sensitivity of externally triggered searches is greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same sensitivity increase was found by dietz et al . @xcite . � while this increased , it is worth noting that , given their expected rate of occurrence , a binary merger within the distance of andromeda or m81 ( @xmath132mpc ) would be extremely unlikely . a short period after its onset .   a short period after its onset .   since gw emission is , in many cases , expected to precede the onset of electromagnetic emission , telescopes have the chance to commence follow -

quark fields are then present in the ope \u001c .    we will argue that it is conceptually simpler to integrate out charm immediately at the scale @xmath89 , assuming a hierarchy @xmath426 , and that this can be done without any loss in accuracy .     we will argue that the charm - quark effects are then entirely contained in the coefficients of the operators , as is apparent from the formulation of the ope given in section 3 .    to illustrate the point we consider the following example . xmath324 � , we note that the coefficient in ( [ kh6d ] ) has a logarithmic divergence in this limit . � this is of no consequence if @xmath429 , where @xmath351 still represents a hard scale . � in fact , for higher - dimensional operators generated by ( [ kh6c ] ) , that is operators with more factors of the gluon field and its derivatives , the coefficients will scale as inverse powers of @xmath351 . � a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 . � a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 . � the effect of the corresponding charm loops has been refered to as intrinsic charm in @xcite , where the issue was discussed in great detail . � the above consideration indicates how the nonperturbative @ [ abmll ] ) . � it contains the component @xmath439 @xmath440 which receives a nonlocal , hadronic contribution @xmath441 from the matrix element of the nonleptonic weak hamiltonian @xmath366 in addition to the semileptonic form factor terms ( @xmath442 ) . � although the hadronic part @xmath443 is relatively small numerically outside the narrow - resonance region ( @xmath444 of @xmath445 ) , it needs to be reliably computed in order to achieve very accurate predictions . � we have presented a detailed study of the hadronic contribution in the region of large dilepton invariant mass @xmath17 , based on an operator product expansion in inverse powers of the hard scale @xmath200 . working with @xmath25-quark fields in full qcd and factorizing the dependence on @xmath89 , @xmath200 and @xmath351 into the coefficient functions , we obtain the following results :     * to leading order in the ope and to all orders in @xmath116 , @xmath17 , based on an operator product expansion in inverse powers of the hard scale @xmath200 . working ille is entirely negligible . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have clarified the relationship between the ope at high @xmath2 and qcd factorization at low @xmath2 by showing that both descriptions yield consistent results at intermediate values of @xmath30 . * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a relevant topic at high @xmath2 is the issue of quark - hadron duality , which is closely related to the existence of an ope . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have defined the ope with the help of a spurion momentum that allows for an independent scaling of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath453 and kaon energy . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this allows one to clarify the analytic structure of the matrix elements of the correlator ( [ khconcl ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , resulting in about @xmath329 for the rate integrated over the high-@xmath2 region . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an important aspect is the different sensitivity to duality violation of the contributions to the rate linear or quadratic in @xmath443 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , to @xmath456 or @xmath457 . � we show that the ope of @xmath76 in ( [ khdef ] ) and ( [ khdef ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath458 at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459 ��� we show that at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459 ��� , right -

for instance , the mobility of dislocations , a kind of topological solitons , is of paramount importance in the physics of plastic deformation of metals and other crystalline bodies @xcite .    in that vein , a prototypical class of discrete models , relevant to a variety of applications , consists of the klein - gordon dynamical lattices @xcite .    in that vein , one of the main representatives of this family of models is the so - called @xmath of caution that should be made ; see e.g. the discussion of @xcite ) .    in that vein , recently , a number of non - integrable discrete klein - gordon equations free of the peierls - nabarro barrier ( pnb - free ) has been systematically constructed .    in that vein , the first set of such models which were , by construction , hamiltonian ones , was obtained by speight and co - workers @xcite using the bogomolnyi argument @xcite .    in that vein , a second successful attempt led to the construction of momentum - conserving discretizations @xcite .     in that vein , it was then demonstrated , surprisingly , that the pnb - free models of that kind conserving both energy and classical momentum do not exist @xcite .     in that vein , a number of new pnb - free @xmath0 lattices were derived by barashenkov _    ( [ kleingordondiscrete1 ] ) .    in that vein , we note that for the lattices derived in @xcite , only the kink - type solution has been considered the hamiltonian of the klein - gordon field , @xmath5 , with the kinetic and potential energy functionals respectively defined as , @xmath6 @xmath7dx\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the unknown field and @xmath9 is a given potential function .      the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath10 where @xmath11 𓺫 ( [ kg ] ) will be discretized on the lattice @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the lattice spacing .    we would like to construct a nearest - neighbor discrete analog to eq .  𓺫 ( [ kg ] ) of the form @xmath15 such that in the continuum limit @xmath16 we have @xmath17 _ and _ that the solution to the three - point static problem corresponding to eq .  𓺫 ( [ kg ] ) of the form @xmath17 can be found from a reduced two - point static problem corresponding to eq .  𓺫 ( [ kg ] ) of the form @xmath17 , @xmath17 _ and _ that the solution the pn barrier is defined to be equal to @xmath27 . for hamiltonian models \u0013 this definition is equivalent to the classical one because @xmath27 is equal to the energy difference between the second ( possibly higher energy unstable ) configuration and the first ( possibly lower energy stable ) configuration . for non - hamiltonian models \u0013 this definition is equivalent to the classical one because @xmath27 is equal to the energy difference between the second ( possibly higher energy unstable ) configuration and the first ( possibly lower energy stable ) configuration . for non - hamiltonian models \u0013 , @xmath28 will depend on the path connecting the initial and final configurations of particles . to calculate @xmath27 one          , therefore , has to specify such a path .          while the height of the pn barrier in a non - hamiltonian lattice depends on the path , the pnb - free , non - hamiltonian lattice can be unambiguously defined as the translationally invariant lattice where the quasi - static transformation between the two configurations of interest can be done continuously through the set of _ equilibrium _ configurations . along the path through the equilibrium configurations , forces acting on particles are zero and thus , @xmath29 note in passing that while our presentation will be geared towards the @xmath0 models , our results regarding the existence of solutions can equally well be applied to discrete equations of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type @xcite , such as e.g. the ablowitz - ladik model . \u001c in particular , let us consider equations of the form : @xmath31 ( where the overbar denotes complex conjugate ) with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . then , \u001c looking for standing wave solutions of the form @xmath34 , with @xmath21 real , one would obtain the klein - gordon static problem for the standing wave spatial profile @xmath21 . \u001c hence all the discussion given below for the existence of such solutions can be appropriately translated in the existence of standing waves of the corresponding discrete nls models . \u001c the reader should be cautioned however that the stability properties in the latter context may differ [ a relevant example will be discussed later in the text ] . \u001c our presentation will be structured as follows . in section [ sec : \u001c pnpfreekg ] , we develop the dfi approach and derive pnb - free klein - gordon models supporting one ref .

[ the reason why we lose , in general , an @xmath288 in the decay exponent as @xmath289 , is that we need to use a little bit of decay @xmath290 in order to sum over all diagrams and scales , see ref.@xcite for details . ]    in order to guarantee that the flow of the chemical potential remains bounded , we fix the initial data ( via a fixed point theorem , such as the contraction mapping theorem ) so that @xmath291 , in the limit as @xmath292 . thanks to the dimensional gain of @xmath293 , due to the irrelevance of the interaction 295(const.)@xmath296 , for all scales @xmath301 .    finally , once the chemical potential is fixed so that @xmath313(const.)@xmath296 , we immediately infer that the beta functions of @xmath274 and @xmath212 are bounded by ( const.)@xmath296 , as well : therefore , their flows converge exponentially fast , and the dressed values of @xmath274 and @xmath212 are analytic functions of @xmath0 , analytically close to their bare values . leads to the plot in fig.[figaltezza ] .     note that , as discussed in sect.[sec.symm ] , there is no symmetry reason why @xmath34 should be equal to @xmath35 .     actually , an explicit computation shows that @xmath320 is different from zero along the critical line , unless we are at one of the highly symmetric points @xmath321 or @xmath192 , see fig.[fig1 - 2 ] , where we plot the value of @xmath320 on the critical line at second order in @xmath0 , for two different values of @xmath0 .     in this section we compute the jump discontinuity of the hall conductivity across the critical line , as well as the value of the longitudinal conductivity on the same line , and prove a universality result for both of them , i.e. , we prove that their values are quantized and exactly independent of the interaction strength @xmath0 .     note that this fact is highly non - trivial , due to the unusual renormalization of the fermi velocity and of the wave function renormalizations , which depends explicitly on the spinor index and break the asymptotic relat [ [ sec.rg ] : in particular , the condition that we are not at a graphene point means that @xmath325 should be kept finite as @xmath326 . using the definition , as well as the fact that @xmath327 is differentiable in @xmath100 outside the critical line , we can rewrite @xmath328.\\ ] ]  [ sec.rg ] : in particular , proceeding as in ref.@xmath101 , we can rewrite @xmath327 .

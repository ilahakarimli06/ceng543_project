\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this paper presents a test to identify galaxies whose cr is favorably structure is constrained to be between the ilr and olr of the spiral pattern .    the cr is between the ilr and olr .    the cr is between the ilr and olr .    it is not known how often spiral structure remains relatively bright , or even optically detectable , at radii approaching the olr .    it is not known how often the spiral structure is probably detectable at the cr in most galaxies .     we seek galaxies for which the spiral structure is not merely detectable , but is genuinely bright , at the cr .

modifications and interpretation of equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] when the rotation curve is not flat . the numerical coefficient in equation  [ eq_ilrcr ]  [ eq_ilrcr ] and  [ eq_ilrolr ] was referred to in  [ sec_extensive ] as the `` typical '' ratio . \u001c what is the characteristic of spiral structure bounded between the ilr and o value of @xmath28 . ㅋ figure  [ fig_4graph]_a _ shows the variation of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ratios for @xmath31 . ㅋ the @xmath29 curve is asymptotic to @xmath32 and the @xmath33 curve is asymptotic to @xmath34 , diverging strongly only for very low pattern speeds . ㅋ consider the following family of rotation curves : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rotation speed as a function of radius @xmath37 and @xmath28 and @xmath27 are free parameters . for small @xmath37 , @xmath38 is approximately linear , and for large @xmath37 , @xmath39 is approximately constant , thus approximating the shapes of many real rotation curves . ㅋ graphs of the ratios @xmath29 and @xmath40 are shown in figure  [ fig_4graph]_b _ for the equation  [ eq_rcfamily ] family . ㅋ the ratios are independent of the asymptotic rotation speed and the slope of the inner part . ㅋ the ratios depend weakly on pattern speed until the pattern speed is a significant 29 and @xmath30 ratios can be arbitrarily large . rotation curves of this shape are shown in fig .  4 in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1990 ) .    the numerical solution for the resonance ratios led to the curves graphed in figure  [ fig_4graph]_d_. in this case , too , the range between the canonical test value and the conservative test value includes much of the variation in the resonance ratios shown in fig .  4 in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1990 ) .    in all cases of realistic rotation curve shapes examined above , most of the variation in the resonance ratios falls within the range between the canonical and conservative tests derived for a flat rotation curve . for many rotation curves , the ratio is smaller than that for a flat rotation curve ( see , e.g. , fig .  4 in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1990 ) .    in all cases of realistic rotation curves examined above , most of the variation in the resonance ratios falls

groove mode . in these cases , apparent extension of the spiral structure through lindblad resonance should not be apparent .  perspect ccd frames have been obtained for 140 galaxies .  perspect the

galaxies with an inner and an outer pattern , � separate computations were made for the end of the bright spiral pattern and the end of its faint extension . � the column in table  [ tab_spextent ] labeled `` s / n '' indicates the signal - to - noise ratio for the outer spiral structure detection . � the signal was measured as a @xmath56-pixel ( @xmath57 , a typical spiral arm width for

structure was determined was typically much brighter than @xmath58 . using the calibrated surface photometry shown in fig .  [ fig_surphot ] and outer spiral extents from table  [ tab_spextent ] , the mean surface brightness at the outer extent of the spiral structure was computed ( table  [ tab_spbright ] ) .    the mean surface brightness of the spiral arms are significantly brighter than the mean surface brightness , though . given that the gain of the tek1k chip ( the most frequently used detector for this study ) is @xmath60 , its read noise ( @xmath61 ) is insignificant compared to sky noise for 30-minute exposures , and that the mean sky brightness at the u.  s. naval observatory flagstaff station at @xmath2-band is @xmath62 , the s / n per pixel equals unity for the @xmath63 isophote .    the mean surface brightness at the u.  s. naval observatory flagstaff station at @xmath2-band is @xmath62 , the s / n per pixel equals unity for the @xmath63 isophote .     the mean surface brightness at and if the measured ratio is over 2.0 , there is an `` n '' in the `` pass ? '' column , indicating a violation of the conservative ratio test .      the distribution of values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] and equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratios is shown in figure  [ fig_histo ] .      only a single increment is shown for each galaxy in table  [ tab_spextent ] , except that ngc5248 and ngc6632 have two contributions because these galaxies have two distinct spiral patterns . in other cases where there are two entries for the same galaxy in table  [ tab_spextent ] , the entry that represented the most extensive , continuous , two - armed spiral structure was chosen .      ratios corresponding to the extent of extra or detached arms are not illustrated in fig .      [ fig_histo ] .      most of the galaxies have values of the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio that are less than unity .      this observation is consistent with spiral density wave theory ( spiral structure bounded by the lindblad resonances ) and the fact that most rotation curves are approximately flat .      most of the galaxies have equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio .    the best explanation for the low values of the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio involves the resonant interaction of spirals with bars and rings , as will be discussed below .    there is a peak in the distribution of values of equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] near 0.5 ( see fig .  [ fig_histo ] ) .    most of the galaxies contributing to the peak are barred and ringed galaxies .     the distributions of the values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio are graphed separately in figure  [ fig_type ] for three morphological classes : pure spirals with no sign of ring or bar , barred galaxies ( which may have a ring ) , and ringed galaxies ( which may also have a bar ) including galaxies with pseudorings .     the three morphological classes are graphed separately in figure  [ fig_type ] for three morphological classes : pure spirals with no sign of ring or bar , barred galaxies ( which may have a ring ) , and ringed galaxies ( which may also have a bar ) including galaxies with pseudorings . ringed class to the pure spiral class ( for instance `` b : '' might be `` b '' or `` s '' , and `` r : '' might be `` r '' or `` s '' ) , the galaxy is graphed on histograms for both possible classes as an unshaded box . ============ the values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio are much more evenly distributed for pure spirals than they are for the other morphological classes . ============ ( pure spirals comprise less than one - third of the sample , making their statistics somewhat noisier than those for barred or ringed galaxies . ) the distributions of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio for barred and ringed galaxies , in contrast to pure spirals , are decidedly peaked at small values ( around 0.5 to 0.7 ) . ============ the different appearance of the distributions in fig . ============ [ fig_type ] can be quantified by a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( cf . ============ press et al . ) . ============ the probability that the ratios for pure spirals are drawn from the same population as those for barred spirals is less than 1% ; the probability is just over 1% for . @@@@@@@@ so the rationale explaining why galaxies with bars tend to have less extensive spiral structure may be only a partial explanation  [ fig_type ] for barred spirals but no peak for pure spirals . @@@@@@@@ . the explanation may be true often enough , however , to explain why there is a peak around 0.50.7 in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ fig_type ] for barred spirals but no peak for pure spirals . @@@@@@@@ a correlation between limited spiral extent and the presence of an inner ring can also be explained if , as is fairly well established , inner rings are resonance phenomena . @@@@@@@@ inner rings and pseudorings seem to be located at the inner 4:1 resonance ( cf . @@@@@@@@ combes 1996 ) , which is exterior to the ilr . @@@@@@@@ limiting spiral structure to the range between inner 4:1 and olr also decreases the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio . @@@@@@@@ other aspects of rings are neutral to the discussion or are problematic . @@@@@@@@ the location of an outer ring at the olr ( buta & crocker 1991 ) does not place an extra limitation on spiral extent , and so does nothing to decrease the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio . @@@@@@@@ the group .    _ @@@@@@@@ _ this galaxy may have a central oval , although the morphology of the spiral arms may contribute to the illusion of the oval . in the inner disk ,     _ @@@@@@@@ _ much of the spiral structure is bright and sharply defined , with regions of dust and star formation .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ in the outer disk , spiral arms are faint , smooth , and broad . one spiral arm wraps through considerably more phase than the other .    _ @@@@@@@@ spiral structure penetrates to very small radius in this galaxy .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ the arms are somewhat faint and diffuse , although they are lightly dappled with regions of star formation .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ ngc1042 .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ much of the spiral structure of this galaxy is faint , diffuse , and punctuated by bright knots ( thus resembling ic0211 ) . the spiral structure in the inner disk consists of two short , bright arcs .     _ @@@@@@@@ _ the inner disk has very regular , two -

armed spiral .     _ @@@@@@@@ it appears that there is a single spiral arm in the inner disk that leads continuously , except for a kink or cusp , to one of the two main outer arms .     _ @@@@@@@@ the second main arm emerges in a manner symmetrical to the first , but without obvious connection to the inner disk . a short arm or arc emerges from the interarm region interior to the main arm with the kink .     _ @@@@@@@@ the short arm is initially bright but quickly dims and broadens .     _ @@@@@@@@ it appears that both of the main arms make a transition from narrow and bright to fainter and more diffuse in the outer disk .     _ @@@@@@@@ the spiral arms are narrow and emerge from nearby the nucleus optical disk .    the likelihood that the corotation resonance is within the optical disk can be assessed by comparing the measured ratio of outer to inner spiral extent with the value of the canonical ratio ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ) .    the test using the canonical ratio is not conclusive because of variations due to rotation curve shape .    it is also possible that there is no inner lindblad resonance . to counter our ignorance of the rotation curve ,    a test with a more conservative value of the ratio than equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] should be used ( here , an extra factor of two ) .    in this research, a few galaxies were found that have large spiral extent and whose corotation resonance radius is very likely to be within the bright optical disk . among the best candidates for kinematic study are ngc5829 , ngc6907 , ic0211 , ngc1042 , and ngc0132 .    in this research, it was incidentally found that barred and ringed spirals statistically have more limited spiral extent than pure spirals .     this observation can be explained if many bars end at their inner 4:1 or corotation ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . , g. 1980 , , 81 , 198 dalcanton , j. j. , spergel , d. n. , & summers , f. j. 1997 , , 482 , 659 elmegreen , b. g. 1996 , in _ barred galaxies _ , ed . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen ( asp conf . ser . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen ( asp conf . ser . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen , b. g. 1990 , , 355 , 52 elmegreen , b. g. , elmegreen , d. m. , & montenegro , l. 1992 , , 79 , 37 elmegreen , b. g. , elmegreen , d.m . , & seiden , p. e. 1989 , , 343 , 602 elmegreen , d. m. , & elmegreen , b. g. 1987 , , 314 , 3 elmegreen , d. m. , & elme . m. , & magri , c. 1988 , , 95 , 607 hewitt , j. n. , haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1983 , , 88 , 272 hickson , p. , kindl , e. , & auman , j. r. 1989 , , 70 , 687 huchtmeier , w. k. , & richter , o .- g . a. 1981 , a revised shapley -

provides a theoretical framework within which such phenomena can be studied , here no such framework exists and one has to resort to studies of specific models in order to gain some understanding of the phenomena involved .    one class of such models is driven diffusive systems ( dds ) @xcite . driven by an external field these systems do not generically obey detailed balance so that the steady state has non - vanishing currents . theoretical studies of dds have revealed basic differences between systems in thermal equilibrium and systems far from thermal equilibrium .    for example , it is well known that one dimensional ( @xmath0 ) systems in thermal equilibrium with short - range interactions do not exhibit phenomena such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and phase separation ( except in the limit of zero temperature or in the context of long - range interactions ) @xcite .    in contrast , some examples of noisy @xmath0 dds with local dynamics have been found to exhibit such phenomena .    one example of a noisy system which exhibits ssb in @xmath0 is the asymmetric exclusion model , such as defect sites @xcite or particles @xcite . in these models � it has been found that macroscopic regions of high densities are formed near the defect , much like a high density of cars behind a slow car in a traffic jam @xcite . here � the phase separation is triggered by the defects . � it is of interest to study whether phase separation can occur in @xmath0 noisy homogeneous systems such as on a ring geometry with no defects , where _ all _ possible local transition rates which are consistent with the symmetry and conservation laws of the model are non vanishing . � recently , lahiri and ramaswamy have introduced a lattice model in the context of sedimenting colloidal crystals , where phase separation is found to take place without any inhomogeneities @xcite . in this model , there are two rings coupled to each other and particles on each ring undergo an asymmetric exclusion process . � the hopping rate between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 on each ring depends on the occupation at the @xmath1th site on the other ring . however , this model is studied mainly using monte carlo simulations and no analytical results are available so far . where the three densities are equal the model is exactly described by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian .    we note that the model not only has long - range correlations but has generic long - range _ order_. the mechanism found in this study suggests that systems with dynamical rules defined completely locally and _ a priori _ without respect to any hamiltonian , may have a steady state where the configuration space is sampled according to a measure that is intrinsically global .    the hamiltonian also allows us to identify the analog of a temperature in the microscopic dynamics as related to the drive of the system ; for zero drive , that is symmetric diffusion of the particles , the effective temperature is infinite and phase separation is lost .     in the present work we note that a related but distinct three - species model has recently been introduced by arndt _    in the present work we analyze in detail the @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xmath3 species model which was introduced in @xcite and then generalize it to larger @xmath4 .    in the present work we provide the complete proof of phase separation which follows from the exact calculation of the partition sum in the thermodynamic of particles of different species it is of interest to investigate the steady - state behavior in finite - size systems . � we have found it convenient to do this by employing a matrix product technique previously used to solve the steady state of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite . � however , in the case of three species the simplest form of this technique @xcite is applicable only to a limited class of systems @xcite . for the present model � we generalize the matrix product to a product of rank 6 tensors and write the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation

steady - state weight for the three - species model . � the paper is organized as follows : in section iv we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species to the following rates @xmath9 the particles thus diffuse asymmetrically around the ring . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the @xmath12 case is special . here � the diffusion is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move . � the system thus obeys detailed balance reaching a steady state in which all microscopic configurations ( compatible with the number of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equally probable . � this state is homogeneous , and no phase separation takes place . � we now present a simple argument suggesting that for @xmath13 the steady state of the system is not homogeneous in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity the case @xmath14 � is examined . as a result of the bias in � the exchange rates an @xmath6 particle prefers to move to the left inside a @xmath7 domain and to the right inside a @xmath8 domain . � similarly the motion of @xmath ite . � eventually the system phase separates into three domains of the three species of the form @xmath26 .    in a finite system � the phase separated state may further evolve and become disordered due to fluctuations . � however , the time scale for this to happen grows exponentially with the system size . � for example it would take a time of order of @xmath27 for the @xmath6 domain in the totally phase separated state to break up into smaller domains . � hence in the thermodynamic limit , this time scale diverges and the phase separated state remains stable provided the density of each species is non - zero . � however , these fluctuations affect the densities only near the domain boundaries . � however , these fluctuations affect the densities only near the domain boundaries . they result in a finite width

current in the phase separated the dynamical rules are invariant under the transformation @xmath39 together with @xmath40 .  embodiments in this section we show that the dynamics ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , for the special case @xmath34 , satisfies detailed balance .  embodiments the corresponding hamiltonian , which determines the steady - state distribution , is found to have long - range asymmetric interactions . using this hamiltonian ,  embodiments we calculate analytically the partition sum and bounds on the correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit .  embodiments these are then used to prove the existence of phase separation in the model . later ,  embodiments in section [ matrixans ] we study finite systems for this case and the approach to the thermodynamic limit .  embodiments the general argument presented in the previous section suggests that for the special case @xmath34 , the steady state carries no current for any system size .  embodiments we demonstrate this explicitly by showing that the _ local dynamics _ of the model satisfies detailed balance with respect to a _ long - range asymmetric _  embodiments the hamiltonian @xmath41 .  embodiments we define the occupation variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 the variables @xmath45 and @ math34 is taken into account , the hamiltonian as given by ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is indeed translationally invariant ( see appendix b ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore site @xmath57 may be chosen arbitrarily . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an expression for @xmath41 which is manifestly translationally invariant will be derived at the end of this section . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note that @xmath58 since the lhs yields the number of @xmath19 ( and @xmath15 ) pairs in the system . using this relation the hamiltonian may also be written in a form where the cyclic symmetry is more apparent : @xmath59-(n/3)^2 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the proof of eqs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done by considering a nearest - neighbor particle exchange and verifying that detailed balance is satisfied with respect to ( [ eq : weight ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we start by considering nearest - neighbor sites in the interior of the lattice , namely pairs other than @xmath60 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ for example consider the exchange @xmath61 taking place at two adjacent sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done by considering a nearest to write @xmath41 in a manifestly translationally invariant form we define @xmath74 as the hamiltonian in which site @xmath75 is the origin . @xmath15 nn pairs exist ; only @xmath87 and @xmath19 nn pairs may be found in addition to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains follow @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .     the metastable state is therefore each metastable state has an equal number of domains , @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath92 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains each of length @xmath57 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a total of @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath92 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a total of @xmath93 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath94 corresponds to the @xmath95 state , composed of a total of @xmath5 domains each of length @xmath57 .    the metastable state is thus composed of a total of @ xmath103 rightmost domains are of size @xmath57 and the three leftmost domains are of size @xmath104 each . ccording to the energy of this state , @xmath105 satisfies the following recursion relation @xmath106 with @xmath107 . to see this ccording one notes that the @xmath91-state may be created from the @xmath108-state by first moving a @xmath7 particle from the leftmost @xmath7 domain across @xmath109 @xmath8 particles to the right and then moving an @xmath6 particle from the leftmost @xmath6 domain to the right across the adjacent @xmath7 and @xmath8 domains . ccording the energy cost of these moves is @xmath109 , yielding ( [ rr ] ) . ccording the recursion relation ( [ rr ] ) , together with @xmath110 , is then readily solved to give @xmath111 the energy of all metastable @xmath91-states is larger or equal to @xmath105 as given by eq.([emss ] ) . in the following section we find that the energy cost of these moves is @xmath109 , yielding ( [ in this limit . for @xmath12 all configurations with @xmath34  embodiments are equally probable , so that the partition sum is given by @xmath120 which goes like @xmath121 for large @xmath5 .  embodiments it is instructive to first present the proof of ( [ psum ] ) for small values of @xmath54 .  embodiments this proof will then serve as the basis for the proof for any @xmath35 .  embodiments we start by noting that in calculating the partition sum ( [ psum ] ) , configurations with energy larger then @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) may be neglected in the thermodynamic limit . for simplicity  embodiments we first demonstrate this for @xmath124 , although later we show it for any @xmath35 .  embodiments the contribution to the partition sum from these energy states , @xmath125 , is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of configurations of energy @xmath128 .  embodiments we start by noting that in calculating the partition sum ( [ psum ] ) , configurations with energy larger then @xmath122 are bounded crudely from above by @xmath121 .  embodiments this bound implies @xmath124 reached by uphill steps from a ground state . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , using translational invariance , the partition sum can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the truncated partition sum of one of the @xmath5 sets of configurations . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we proceed to calculate @xmath136 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done by considering all the possible energy excitations with energy less than @xmath131 above one ground state . consider a specific domain boundary , say @xmath17 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 at this boundary can be created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath6 particles into the @xmath6 domain ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , in this picture an excitation of energy @xmath128 at this boundary can be created by moving one or more @xmath6 particles into the @xmath7 domain ( this is equivalent to moving @xmath7 particles into the @xmath6 domain ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an @xmath6 particle moving into the @xmath7 domain is considered as a walker . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the excitation energy increases linearly with the distance this we calculate upper and lower bounds on @xmath52 and show they converge for large enough @xmath5 .    for this    we have to consider the entire energy spectrum of the hamiltonian .    we have to show that any configuration of the system which is neither a ground state nor a metastable state can be obtained from at least one ground state ( @xmath93 ) or a metastable state ( @xmath147 ) as follows : starting from this @xmath91-state exchange nearest neighbors such that the energy always increases along the path until the configuration is reached . in what follows it    it is demonstrated that none of the configurations which can be obtained from @xmath91-states , with @xmath147 , by the above procedure of particle exchange , contributes to the partition sum in the thermodynamic limit .

is given by @xmath154 thus , for large @xmath5 the lower bound ( [ lowbound ] ) converges to ( [ psum ] ) as does the upper bound ( [ zupperb1 ] ) . therefore , for calculating the correlation function it is sufficient to consider the @xmath5 ground states and excitations above them which may be reached by moves which only increase the energy .  perspect as we have seen , these states form @xmath5 disjoint sets of states , each associated with one of the ground states . using this  perspect we now show that @xmath169 . for this purpose  perspect we use a restricted partition sum

[ gsc ] the sum is over all periodic orbits @xmath9 of the classical system , @xmath10 are their action integrals , the amplitudes @xmath11 depend on their stabilities and degeneracies , and @xmath12 are some phases called maslov indices .   [ gqm ] the average part @xmath13 of the density of states , which by definition varies smoothly with energy , is obtained by the extended thomas - fermi ( The trace formulae developed over many aspects of the pot and illustrative applications are given in @xcite .     the one problem that remains with all the trace formulae developed in the work quoted above is that the amplitudes @xmath17 diverge in situations where a continuous symmetry is broken or restored under the variation of a system parameter ( which may also be the energy @xmath18 ) , or where bifurcations of periodic orbits occur . in such situations     one has to go beyond the stationary phase approximation which is underlying the semiclassical approach .     the trace formulae developed for this has , besides @xcite , been developed most systematically by ozorio de almeida and hannay @xcite for both situations , leading to local uniform approximations with finite amplitudes @xmath17 .     the trace formulae developed for the so - called global uniform approximations , which yield finite amplitudes at symmetry - breaking and bifurcation points and far from them go over into the standard ( extended ) gutzwiller trace formula , were developed for the breaking of u(1 ) symmetry in @xcite , for some cases of effects in the total energy @xmath23 of the interacting system as a function of the number @xmath24 of atoms were found , which remind about the so - called super - shells predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in metallic clusters . in a first attempt to interpret these shell effects semiclassically @xcite , we parameterised the self - consistent mean field of the interacting system by the hamiltonian and applied the semiclassical perturbation theory of creagh @xcite to explain qualitatively the shell structure of the hf results .    in the present paper    in section [ secpert ] we describe some of the mathematical details of the semiclassical perturbation theory for the symmetry breaking u(3 ) @xmath25 so(3 ) and develop a uniform trace formula valid for arbitrary strengths @xmath1 in the hamiltonian . in section [ secpert ] we present the perturbative trace formula for the density of states which is valid in the limit of small @xmath1 and has been presented shortly in @xcite . it already puts the dominance of the shortest periodic orbits , namely the circles and diameters , into evidence .    in section [ secpert ] we present acy possible in a three - dimensional spherical system , but due to their length they only affect the finer quantum structures of the density of states .    in the limit @xmath30 , this situation is completely different from that of a spherical billiard @xcite where the contribution of the diameter orbits to the density of states is practically negligible .    in the limit @xmath30 ,    in this limit the system becomes a purely quartic oscillator which in many respects is easier to handle .    in particular , in this limit the system acquires the `` scaling property '' that its classical dynamics becomes independent of the energy which can be absorbed by a rescaling of coordinates and time .     in the limit @xmath30 ,    in particular , in this limit the system acquires the `` scaling property '' that its classical dynamics becomes independent of the energy which can be absorbed by a rescaling of coordinates and time . ating part given by the following exact trace formula @xcite g_0(e ) = 2g_0^etf(e)_k=1^(-1)^k ( 2k ) = 2g_0^etf(e)_k=1^(-1)^k ( 2k ) = 2g_0^etf(e)_k=1^(-1)^k . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ dg3ho ] it can be understood as a sum over all periodic orbits of the system . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ hereby @xmath36 represents the repetition number of the primitive classical periodic orbit which has the action @xmath37 . keeping only the leading tf term of @xmath34 in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , the density of states can also be written in the form g_0(e ) = e _ -^(-1)^ke^i2ke/ + o(^-1 ) , [ g3hoc ] since the imaginary parts cancel upon summation . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note that the smooth tf part in comes from the contribution with @xmath38 in . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ next we follow creagh @xcite by writing the perturbed trace formula in the form g_pert(e ) ) characterising a member of the unperturbed ho orbit family , and @xmath44 is the lowest -

2900  @xcite .    among the predictions for g2  a *  and sgr  a *  are strong increases in radio through millimeter spectrum driven by two processes .    in the case of g2 , increasing the mass accretion rate at separations of a few schwarzschild radii would be expected to lead to enhanced emission from the accretion flow and/or jet .     in the case of g2 , the timescale for this accretion event may be as short as the free - fall time ( @xmath8 yr ) or as long as the viscous time ( 0.1  100 yr ) .    in the case of g2  a *  additionally , a strong precursor effect has been predicted for low radio frequencies due to the potential shock forming between snapshots of a few minutes duration in each of the eight frequency bands .  embodiments observations of 3c 286 were obtained for absolute gain calibration .  embodiments standard pipeline calibration techniques in casa were carried out by nrao staff @xcite .  embodiments the pipeline produced calibrated visibility files that we then analyzed with our own software .  embodiments table  [ tab : vlaobs ] summarizes beam sizes for sgr a * for l and q band ( 1.5 and 40 ghz , respectively ) from images obtained from all of the data in each epoch . unlike the reduction described below ,  embodiments the images included short baselines as a means of demonstrating the large beams that occurred .  embodiments the ratio of q to l band beam sizes does not exactly follow the expected frequency scaling ratio , which is indicative of the poorly shaped beams from these snapshot observations and frequency - dependent weighting in the imaging stage .  embodiments we averaged the data in time into 30s intervals and in frequency for each spectral window .  embodiments we then exported the data for further analysis with our code .  embodiments we performed two kinds of analyses .  embodiments for the first , we extracted flux densities for sgr  a *  by averaging visibility amplitudes on baselines longer than 50 @ of the @xmath10 distance . � that is , longer baselines have greater weight than shorter baselines in order to bias against contamination from extended structure . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � this visibility subtraction scheme works well given the large number of data sets and the fine frequency resolution of the observations . � the frequency resolution permits us to make comparisons that are not limited by the steep spectral indices of some of the extended structures present in the galactic center . � the large number of data sets gives good overlap between extended and compact structures . � the method is sensitive to the effect of pairs of observations with significant overlap in @xmath10 coverage , i.e. , those conducted at the same sidereal time and in the same configuration . in this case � the method effectively differences those two epochs and does not provide a difference with respect to the average . � this effect can be seen in the epoch minutes . � the total flux density , corresponding to stokes i , was produced by summing the response of parallel handed cross - correlations of the orthogonal linearly polarized feeds . � we set absolute amplitude calibration with observations of titan and neptune and set bandpass gains with observations of the compact source j1427 - 421 . � all calibrator sources and sgr  a *  were phase - self - calibrated on timescales of a single integration ( 10 sec ) . � we plot alma and sma light curves for sgr  a * , phase self - calibration solutions were obtained only for baselines longer than @xmath11 . � flux densities for calibrators were determined by bootstrapping amplitude self - calibration solutions to the absolute flux density calibrator . � time - dependent amplitude gain solutions were applied to sgr  a*. unfortunately , alma observations did not include system temperatures obtained for sgr  a*itself . � the pipeline software applied system temperatures obtained for j1733 - 130 ( nrao 530 ) to sgr  a * , which introduces an error because of the different atmospheric optical depth toward these two sources . to correct for this effect , we fitted system temperatures alma bands .      the variability of the calibrators sets an upper bound on the calibration accuracy for sgr  a*. j1733 - 130 , j1700 - 261 , and j1427 - 421 show 5% , 9% , and 14% variability , respectively , in the fitted intensity at 230 ghz assuming a power - law spectrum for these sources .      thus , we take 5% as the systematic calibration error in the sgr  a*flux density .      the alma and sma light curves at 230 ghz ( top ) and 345 ghz ( bottom ) for sgr  a*. each alma spectral window is plotted , covering 218 to 235 ghz ( top ) and 341 to 355 ghz ( bottom ) .      the two lower frequency spectral windows for each alma band are plotted with filled symbols .      these match most closely the plotted sma flux densities , which are in the range 212 to 241 ghz and 331 to 356 ghz , respectively , and have mean frequencies of 221 and 338 ghz . ]    . for a polarization of 10 percent has an rms error of 7 percent . � this error is comparable to the level of the statistical errors . to this data set � were added more extensive observations over several hours in dual polarization mode on 5 july and 15 aug 2013 , which allowed short - term monitoring . � data from each observing period were calibrated with the millimeter interferometer reduction ( mir ) suite of reduction routines developed by the sma , involving removal of visibility phase scatter due to atmospheric instability and scaling visibility amplitude via comparison with the flux standard . � neptune was the primary flux standard used ( 85% of observations ) , with uranus ( 13% ) and titan ( 2% ) as the other standards . for uranus and neptune � , we used the spectral model from @xcite . � however , due to the presence of broad co absorption in the spectrum of neptune which is not included in the griffin and orton spectral fit , we opted to use data that were at least 8 ghz separated from either the co(1 - 2 ) or co(3 - 2 ) rotational transitions . for uranus and neptune � , we used the spectral model developed by author g are tabulated in table  [ tab : smaresults ] .  embodiments the mean spectrum of sgr  a *  from vla , alma , and sma observations is presented in table  [ tab : meanspec ] and figure  [ fig : meanspec ] , along with variability , minimum flux , and maximum flux .  embodiments the ratio of the rms variability to the total flux density , known as the modulation index , is 8% at 40 ghz and below , while it is @xmath15 at millimeter wavelengths .  embodiments this variability can not be attributed to differences in calibration accuracy .  embodiments the mean spectrum of sgr  a *  from vla and alma observations .  embodiments the solid black line shows the mean and the shaded regions show the @xmath16 boundaries for the flux density based on the rms of the variations .  embodiments the ratio of the rms variability to the total flux density , known as the modulation index , is 8% at 40 ghz and below , while it is @xmath15 at millimeter wavelengths .  embodiments we plot several model curves representing synchrotron emission from relativistic thermal maxwell - juttner distributions .  embodiments we also plot n 0.4 to + 0.2 , with a mean of -0.13 . , ranging from @xmath28 k , assuming an emission region of size @xmath29 .     the observed brightness temperature of sgr a * at 230 ghz is @xmath30 k @xcite .     these are fiducial values spanning the range from the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? � * and references therein ) , to illustrate how stratified , self - absorbed regions can add to a near - flat spectrum , but also to place some limits on the fraction and distribution of non - thermal particles present .     the peak of a given temperature component can shift by a factor of a few in frequency for different emission size regions or energy partition between radiating particles and the magnetic energy density .     however , it is clear that a peak temperature ( in the plasma closest to the black hole ) below a few @xmath31 k can not account for the extension of the self - absorbed spectrum through the alma range shown , and that a peak temperature much higher than a few @xmath32 k would violate the ir limits .     it is also clear from these spectra that a purely thermal distribution can not account for the ir flux .     the intersection of the ir power - law The simultaneous observations between alma , ir , and x - ray , particularly during flaring , would provide strong constraints on the upper extreme of the nonthermal population and accelerating mechanisms .      bow shock emission from the interaction of g2 with the accretion flow was anticipated to appear and peak months before the center of mass reached periastron @xcite .     the bow shock would excite nonthermal electrons that then produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the accretion flow .      the synchrotron radiation is expected to peak at frequencies near 1 ghz and decline with an optically thin power - law index @xmath34 .      the predicted peak flux density of the radio light curve scales with a number of factors , including the relative velocity of the cloud , the accretion flow density profile , the efficiency of nonthermal electron energy production , and the timescale for electrons to cool .     the flux density of the bow shock is predicted to peak at frequencies near 1 ghz and decline with an optically thin power - law index @xmath34 .    the predicted peak flux density of the radio light curve scales with a shorter time scale variations through an analysis of all the measurements in the three lowest vla frequency bands .     we compute estimates of the flux density excess above the average at 1.0 ghz using low frequency measurements ( figure  [ fig : bowshock ] ) .      we extrapolate the flux density excess at 1.5 , 3.1 , and 5.4 ghz to 1 ghz , assuming a power - law spectrum with index @xmath40 , appropriate for optically thin synchrotron emission . at frequencies above 5 ghz ,    the intrinsic variability rises rapidly and is likely to exceed estimates of any bow shock - related variability .     [ fig : bowshock ] .    the new data appear to show higher radio flux densities at frequencies @xmath45 ghz over historical averages ( figure  [ fig : specvla ] and table  [ tab : meanspec ] ) .    the 40.9 ghz flux density , for instance , has a mean of 1.5 jy and a range of 1.3 to 1.9 jy , whereas @xcite found a 43 ghz flux density mean of 1.0 jy and a range of 0.6 to 1.9 jy .    the new vla data appear to show similar results with smaller amplitudes differences are apparent at lower frequencies .    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are higher than those of @xcite but still show a lower average flux density at most frequencies relative to the new vla data .    the new vla data appear to show similar results with smaller amplitudes differences are apparent at lower frequencies .    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are higher than those of @xcite but still show a lower average flux density at most frequencies relative to the new vla data .    the new v 230 ghz is @xmath51 jy . � similarly , for band 7 ( 345 ghz ) and historical 345 ghz data , we find @xmath52 jy and @xmath53 jy , respectively . results from the sma data are comparable . � thus , increases in the millimeter and submillimeter mean flux density are no more than 20% relative to historical averages , again consistent with typical llagn variability levels . � a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the alma and sma measurements are consistent ( @xmath54 ) with originating from the same distribution . � the alma and sma measurements differ from the @xcite measurements with varying significance . � the alma 230 and 345 ghz data differ from the @xcite distributions with @xmath55 , while the band 6 ( 230 ghz ) and band 7 ( 345 ghz ) distributions differ with significances of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . � these variations may be partly the result of different calibration accuracies . � the alma and sma measurements differ from the @xcite measurements with varying significance . � the alma and sma 230 and 345 ghz ite . � it is plausible that an enhancement of emission caused by g2 might have produced long term variations indicative of red noise . � however , there is no evidence for this effect . � the spectrum of sgr  a *  from radio to submillimeter wavelengths has remained remarkably stable over the past 30 years . � our new vla , alma , and sma results demonstrate that this stability has continued throughout the apparent periastron passage of g2 . in the case of low - frequency emission , � the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole . � these observations do not resolve the nature of g2 . � the smaller bow shock size is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models . � @xcite propose a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent with our results . � the @xmath7 continuum observations reveal a compact source while br-@xmath6 observations reveal an extended source that appears to be tidally disrupted . � these observations do not retion rate .    the amplitude and timescale for a change in the accretion rate , should g2 be fully disrupted , are uncertain . in order for the disrupted material to enhance the flux density , the gas must reach a radius of a few schwarzschild radii to contribute to the accretion flow and/or enhance jet power . the free - fall time from @xmath63 is @xmath64 yr . if a fraction @xmath65 of the material were on a plunging orbit due to tidal disruption or a spread in orbital characteristics , we would have expected an enhancement of the overall flux density during these observations .    the flux density should scale as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a model - dependent constant for jet and accretion disk models . for a g2 mass of @xmath68 appropriate for the gas - cloud model and a steady - state accretion rate onto sgr  a *  of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 for @xmath72 .    the flux density should scale as @xmath72 .    the flux density should scale as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a model -

      "generated": "ression of the low - energy part of bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic electrons passing through an amorphous scattering medium is the celebrated lpm - effect @xcite , named after landau and pomeranchuk who predicted it qualitatively @xcite , and migdal @xcite who provided an accurate theory for bremsstrahlung in a semi - infinite uniform medium .     it has also been studied for finite - thickness targets @xcite , and for the opposite limit of thin target , which is of intrinsic interest @xcite .     the theoretical predictions were accurately tested experimentally only within the last two decades @xcite , and the theoretical and experimental state of the art is reviewed in @xcite .    a natural further step , both for practice and for theory , is to study composite targets .    one of the simplest configurations thereof is a sequence of thin plates with a gap between them comparable to the photon formation length @xmath1 the latter quantity depends on the electron energy @xmath2 and photon energy @xmath0 in the window covered by the detector , @xmath3 standing for the electron mass .    the problem of structured target as the theory @xcite , but also found some departures from it , and , surprisingly , from other theoretical predictions , which were expected to be more accurate .    to clarify the origin of remaining discrepancies    , it may be instructive to recollect underlying assumptions for the theories at the market . the latter is that it naturally invokes fourier transforms of scattering - angle distribution functions , which from solution of the kinetic equation express as simple exponentials of the fourier - transformed scattering differential cross - section . factor , and @xmath13 the radiation angle .     the use of the latter expression suggests that for the distance @xmath14 between the plate centers , the main spectral maximum should be located at @xmath15 .     it is not a priori obvious whether there should be a factor @xmath10 , as expected , but also a denominator @xmath16 , which might compensate it .     it is not a priori obvious whether there should be a factor @xmath10 , as expected , but also a denominator @xmath16 , which might compensate it .     practically , though , it is not a priori obvious , with respect to which direction the radiation angles should be counted , and what are their typical values . if one estimates them as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the rms scattering angle in the plates @xcite , then for @xmath19 the compensation between the @xmath10 factor and the denominator can be significant . but numerically , such estimates still contradict the experimental findings @xcite .     concerning the comparative strength of the contributions from the enhancement region and the suppression region at low @xmath0 , introduce appropriate visibilities of the interference pattern . � the absence of interference in the total radiative energy loss at successive random scatterings has a simple physical reason : equivalently , it can be expressed as a _ time _ integral of the particle acceleration squared , in which time - separated scatterings obviously give non - interfering contributions @xcite : @xmath37 hence , if a suppression occurs in one region of the spectrum ( typically at lowest @xmath0 where it is associated with the lpm effect ) , it should be accompanied by a commensurable _ enhancement _ in some other region ( which is natural to call the anti - lpm effect ) . � the established property is undoubtedly general and must hold as well for a number of scatterings greater than 2 . � but it may contradict our experience that in a target with @xmath35-correlated scatterings , interference effects to the spectrum are purely suppressive , and there is seemingly no enhancement region at all @xcite . the contradiction is resolved if one takes into account that in condensed matter , distances between atoms are very short indeed , being usually far shorter than photon formation length . specifically , if we consider inequality @xmath38 where _ quantum _ arguments stipulate that @xmath39 , condition ( [ aa - g the smallness of scattering angles ( dipole limit ) , when @xmath44 . in that case , the structure of currents ( [ j21-def])([j32-def ] ) appreciably simplifies . ] ) of the structure @xmath60 .    the large - angle asymptotics of ( [ f - def ] ) is logarithmic : @xmath61 the logarithm here stems from the fact that although for a large - angle scattering , the radiation cones from the initial and final electron lines are well separated , the region between them is filled by an enhanced radiation , owing to the interference between the cones .     it is integration over this inter - jet domain which gives rise to the large logarithm in ( [ f - la ] ) .

the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite based on our model obviates this lift . )    the main advantage of our model is related to its combinatorial nature .    the combinatorial nature of this model is computationally efficient because it uses simple labels for the vertices of an irreducible crystal , namely certain finite sets of positive integers ( called admissible subsets ) ; these can be efficiently constructed .     the combinatorial nature of our model is related to its  chains .  embodiments we will give an explicit construction of a @xmath0-chain ( in proposition [ constr -

accretion disks and grbs . � * gw data *  in fact , gw data has helped rule out binary mergers as the central engines of selected events @xcite . � * population prospects *  the populations of short grbs @xcite , as well as compact binaries @xcite , are highly uncertain � . the observation of gws from compact binary coalescences could be an effective way of determining the source population . due to the very large field - of - view of gw detectors and the very weak beaming of gw emission � , they can be used efficiently to locate practically all sources within their well - determined horizon distance of hundreds of megaparsecs . � * source distances *  the binary coalescence population could also be determined using gws ( see next subsection ) , the binary coalescence population could also be mapped as a function of redshift , although only with the sensitivity of third - generation gw detectors @xcite . � * cosmological parameters *  the detection of a binary coalescence gw signal from an observed short grb could of the inspiral gw signals in principle could be used to characterize the viewing angle of observed grbs @xcite .  embodiments the gw polarization from a binary inspiral depends on the viewing angle compared to the rotational axis of the binary . towards the rotational axis ,  embodiments the gw signal is circularly polarized , while the polarization becomes elliptical for off - axis observers , eventually becoming linear for observers in the equatorial plane . for sufficiently strong gw signals from the inspiral phase , reconstructing the eccentricity of the gw polarization could provide information on the opening angle . with a large number of measurements , the angular structure of the jet could be mapped as well @xcite .  embodiments these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave @xcite .  embodiments nevertheless , due to the relatively weak change in gw polarization with angle , the gw polarization may only be identified for large ( @xmath112 ) angular differences , and/or for very high snr ( @xmath113 ) , making the utility of gw polarization limited .  embodiments these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave w energy spectrum during the last few orbits of a ns - ns binary prior to merger can be used to determine the compactness ratio ( mass / radius ) of the nss @xcite . for these last few orbits of the binary � , the gw frequency is at a high but still reasonably sensitive frequency for ligo - type detectors , making the analysis of these last few orbits feasible . � + the tidal deformation of a ns in the inspiral phase can be described by one parameter ( the so - called _ love number _ @xcite ) , which is effectively the ratio of the star s induced quadrupole moment to the quadrupole moment of the perturbing tidal gravitational field of the binary companion . � flanagan & hinderer @xcite showed that the nuclear eos of nss can be constrained even through the early inspiral phase due to the effect of tidal deformation on the waveform . � read et al . � @xcite simulated the inspiral phase of ns - ns binaries , showing that the ns eos can be constrained ( the ns radius can be determined to within @xmath115 km precision , which ,

individual pulsars ( e.g. , from their spindown rate @xcite ) . in the inspiral phase , internal magnetic fields in nss ( for realistic field strengths )  神 have negligible effect on the dynamics of the binary coalescence @xcite .  神 while magnetic tension in the ns can reduce tidal deformation , this effect will be too weak to be detectable with planned gw iperiodic gw emission from instabilities in the accretion disk , probably together with the detection of the earlier inspiral phase from the binary , can be utilized to reconstruct properties of the accretion disk , even if no electromagnetic signal is observed from the source . beyond reconstructing the mass and lifetime of the accretion disk ,  the development of the instabilities is sensitive to the properties of the accretion disk ( see section [ section : accretiondiskinstabilities ] ) , i.e. the development of the instabilities by itself can already be informative .       1 .      1 .     1 .     1 .     1 .

rotational instabilities and the resulting gw emission . further ,  神 if a hypermassive ( or supramassive ; see section [ subsubsection : mergerphase ] for their definition ) ns collapses into a bh due to either losing angular momentum or accretion , the rotational frequency prior to collapse provides information on the ns eos @xcite .  神 this rotational frequency may be inferred from the gw signal from the rotating ns @xcite .  神 * accretion physics *  because gw emission from massive stellar collapses can be produced by the accretion onto the central object following the collapse , the gw signal therefore can provide insight into accretion physics : ( i ) the mechanisms that transport angular momentum ; ( ii ) instabilities ; and ( iii ) interaction with the black hole .  神 the strength of viscosity ( and possibly the strength of viscosity ( and possibly the strength of other processes through which the torus loses angular momentum ) can be determined , as these are competing effects for angular momentum loss : the total loss of angular momentum can be inferred from the rate of change of the gw frequency , while the loss through gws gws from nss excited by , e.g. , starquakes , could be used to infer the ns mass , radius and eos @xcite , or potentially even the strength of magnetic fields inside the ns @xcite .    the detection of millisecond magnetars gw signature in coincidence with a grb would confirm their presence and role as the central engine behind some grbs .    the detection of millisecond magnetars gw signature may indicate their origin ( e.g. , typical rotation rates may differ for different mechanisms ; see section [ section : millisecondmagnetars ] ) .    the detection of millisecond magnetars gw signature in coincidence with a grb would rule out the other scenarios in which millisecond magnetars may form , e.g. , typical rotation rates may differ for different mechanisms ; see section [ section : millisecondmagnetars ] ) .    the detection of millisecond magnetars by advanced gw detectors will also be able to determine , out to @xmath121mpc , whether the progenitor of a short grb was a binary merger of a ns with another ns or a bh @xcite .    the confirmation of a and to some extent the merger phase @xcite . for such systems with properties in a highly limited parameter space , it is beneficial to use a signal waveform template bank and perform matched filtering based analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .     in the following we review the gw search strategies targeting the progenitors of grbs .     in the following we indicate the prospects of such searches through presenting projected sensitivity estimates based on observational results with initial detectors .     in the following we indicate that the advanced detectors will be @xmath122 more sensitive than initial detectors , the exclusion distances therefore will be @xmath122 greater , corresponding to a @xmath251000-fold improvement in achievable source rate constraints .     in the following we indicate that the advanced detector network will eventually be larger , with the inclusion of kagra and probably ligo india .      in the following we indicate that these improvements will further increase the achievable sensitivity of the advanced detector network @xcite , and will further improve signal parameter reconstruction ( e.g. , source direction ; @xcite ) @xcite .     in the following we indicate that the gw search strategies for , @xcite )    for realistic grb beaming angles     , the beaming of gw emission from grb progenitors is weak ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for realistic grb beaming angles     , there will likely be more observations of gws from off - axis grb progenitors than gw observations triggered by grbs @xcite .    to help quantify the source population detectable with untriggered ( and other ) searches , it is useful to characterize the sensitivity of a gw observatory to a gw source with the so - called _ horizon distance _ @xmath123 .    the horizon distance is defined as the distance at which a gw source from optimal orientation ( such that emission towards the earth is the strongest ) and optimal location ( i.e. the most sensitive direction of the gw detector ) is observed with a given snr ( typically chosen to be @xmath124 for untriggered searches ; see also section [ subsubsection : extrig ] ) by a single gw detector .    when compared to this optimal orientation and location , the orientation and direction - averaged distance at which the source produces the the number of triggered and untriggered detections of gws from grb progenitors would be comparable . further , even for greater beaming factors ( i.e. smaller opening angles ) , externally triggered searches will enable the detection of some additional , particularly interesting , sources . � the extra information in external triggers can be taken into account in the horizon distance by effectively lowering the snr threshold ( i.e. by keeping the false - alarm rate constant ) . � the results of chen & holz imply that the sensitivity of externally triggered searches is greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same sensitivity increase was found by dietz et al . @xcite . � the results of chen & holz @xcite find that while this increased horizon distance means that many more sources fall within observable reach , the actual number of detected sources will be decreased by the beaming of the electromagnetic ( or other ) signal , as well as the sky coverage of the available electromagnetic telescopes . on the other hand , � all triggered sources will be detected face - on , while , it is worth noting that , given their expected rate of occurrence , a binary merger within the distance of andromeda or m81 ( @xmath132mpc ) would be extremely unlikely . a short period after its onset .     since gw emission is , in many cases , expected to precede the onset of electromagnetic emission , telescopes have the chance to commence follow - up observation in a very early emission stage , or even catch the onset of the electromagnetic event .    gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   the

the sensitivity of multimessenger searches depends on the false alarm statistics of the different detectors included in the search , as well as the types of messengers . @@@@@@@@ transient messengers

the sensitivity of multimessenger searches depends on the false alarm statistics of the different detectors included in the search , as well as the types of messengers . @@@@@@@@ transient messengers with amplitude signatures , such as gws or high - statistics photon signals , will have a relatively well defined horizon distance � most compact object mergers observed by ligo / virgo will not be accompanied by observable grbs due to the small gamma - ray beaming angle . � for this reason , the last few years have seen extensive investigation into rapid follow - up search strategies for more isotropic , but more difficult to identify , electromagnetic counterparts . � follow - up searches aim to minimize the time between the identification of a gw event candidate and the start time of the observation with electromagnetic telescopes in the required directions . the time delay of sending a request for follow - up search to electromagnetic telescopes after a gw event was @xmath25tens of minutes for initial searches ( mostly due to the manual confirmation of event selection ) . � this delay will likely be reduced to @xmath25minutes for searches with advanced detectors @xcite . � the

magnetosphere of the other , highly magnetized ns ( @xmath147 g ) ,    the induced electromagnetic force across the non - magnetic ns sets up a circuit connecting the two stars .       some of this electric potential dissipates either in the surface layer of the magnetic ns or in the space between the two stars , depending on the resistivity of the space between the two stars .                                       a part of the dissipated energy is carried away through electromagnetic emission , which can reach up to @xmath98erg@xmath50s@xmath148 in the last @xmath7s prior to merger @xcite .

selten linear tracing procedure .  embodiments for each algorithm , we use the uniform distribution as the prior distribution , which is a natural choice .  embodiments the van den elzen - talman algorithm uses a homotopy based on a starting mixed -

talman algorithm restricted to the two - player case uses the homotopy @xmath281 where for @xmath282 @xmath287 has a payoff of @xmath289 for the row player , regardless of how the column player plays ( thus , @xmath287 is dominated by all the other strategies ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the payoffs to the column player are chosen in such a way that , if in fact the row player uses the uniform distribution over @xmath290 , then the column player s payoffs will be 1 for @xmath227 and 0 for @xmath229 , for @xmath230 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the new strategy @xmath288 has a similar definition . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note that the new payoffs are at most @xmath45 in absolute value . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these new strategies ensure that we have the desired @xmath1 of section  [ sec : lt ] , when we restrict each player to his first @xmath45 strategies . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the new strategies @xmath287 and @xmath288 are not used in any nash equilibrium of @xmath169 , since they are strictly dominated for all @xmath2 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we let @xmath48 be the uniform distribution . in @xmath167 , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the new strategies ensure that we have the desired @xmath1 of section  [ sec : l the same ( lower ) payoffs .    [ lhtheorem ] the lemke - howson ( l - h ) algorithm is an important and rich research subject in and by itself within game theory ; for the purposes of this reduction , it is helpful to take a point of view that considers the l - h algorithm as a homotopy  @xcite , where an arbitrary strategy ( the one whose label is dropped initially ) is given a large `` bonus '' to be played , so that the unique equilibrium consists of that strategy together with its best response from the other player ; the homotopy arises from reducing that bonus continuously to zero .    [ lhtheorem ] it is -complete to find _ any _ of the solutions of a 2-player game that are constructed by the lemke - howson algorithm .

The subsequent detailed investigation , at many wavelengths , has produced a large body of observational data for the hickson catalog . as a result , it has now become possible to address some of the outstanding questions concerning the nature of compact groups and their role in galaxy evolution . not surprisingly , new questions have been raised and new controversies have appeared . 170 triplets , 33 quartets , and 2 quintets .     unfortunately , the sample received little follow - up study .    sulentic ( 1983 ) re - examined the 35 rose groups which contain four or more galaxies and found that only a third actually satisfied the selection criteria .     this is testimony to the difficulty of visual searches .     a more fundamental problem is that the fixed magnitude limit in the selection criteria makes the sample susceptible to strong distance - dependent biases .    in an attempt to reduce such effects , hickson ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) adopted a relative magnitude criterion , selecting systems of four or more galaxies whose magnitudes differ by less than 3.0 .    in order to reduce such biases , a distance independent ( to first order ) compactness criterion was employed : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean surface brightness of the group calculated by distributing the flux of the member galaxies over the smallest circular area containing their geometric centers . to avoid including the cores of rich clusters , an isolation criterion was necessary so as to reject the group if a non - member galaxy , not more than 3 mag fainter than the brightest member , occurred within three radii contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . � in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used . � attempts to rectify these problems have been made by hickson et al ( 1989 ) and sulentic ( 1997 ) . � however , it should be emphasized that changes , such as using photometric magnitudes in the selection criteria , are not corrections to the catalog , but are actually the imposition of _ additional _ a postiori selection criteria . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the new criteria are applied only to the visually - selected hcg catalog and not to the entire sky . � because of the difficulty of identifying faint groups , the hcg catalog starts to become significantly incomplete at an integrated magnitude of about 13 ( hickson et al 1989 , sulentic & rabaa 1994 ) . a more subtle effect results from the difficulty of recognizing low - surface - brightness groups . � the resulting subsample is by no means complete because the catalog also becomes incomplete at surface ski 1995 ) .      an alternative approach is to identify groups of galaxies from redshift information , as was first done by humason et al ( 1956 ) . with the advent of large - scale redshift surveys ,      it has become possible to identify a reasonably - large sample of compact groups in this way .      barton et al ( 1996 ) have compiled a catalog of 89 redshift - selected compact groups ( rscgs ) found by means of a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey .      there are some significant differences , however , in the hcg sample , there are some significant differences , however , in the hcg sample , there are some significant differences , however , in the hcg sample , there are some significant differences , however , in the hcg sample , there are some significant differences , however , in the hcg sample , there are some significant differences , however : because foreground and background galaxies having projected separations of @xmath8 kpc or less and line - of - sight velocity differences of 1000 km s@xmath3 or less are connected and the sets of connected galaxies constitute the groups . the numerical values were chosen to best match the characteristics bias . � the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature . � the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) . � a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters . � this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion . � however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups . � a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups and clusters . � rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters . � studies of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( vennik et al 1993 , ramella et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , garcia 1995 , barton et al 1996 ) indicate that compact sub - condensations do occur within loose groups and filaments . importance to the question of the physical nature of compact groups , discussed below in section 6 .    in addition , many independent studies have found significant differences between galaxies in compact groups and those in other environments .    in addition , these are examined in section 5 .    in addition , the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , burbidge & sargent 1971 , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters . however , because of the small number of galaxies , estimates of the space velocities and physical separations of galaxies in individual groups are highly uncertain .    in addition , meaningful dynamical conclusions about systems containing only four or five galaxies requires statistical analysis of large homogeneous samples .    by 1992    in addition , velocities had been measured for almost all 462 galaxies in the hcg catalog ( hickson et al 1992 ) .    in addition , the distribution of galaxy velocities , relative to the median of each group , is shown in figure 2 . and obtained a mean mass - to - light ratio of @xmath16 ( solar units ) for the hcgs . � similar values were found for several shakhbazian groups ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian 1989 , lynds et al 1990 , amirkhanian et al 1991 ) . � since the mass - to - light ratios of individual hcg galaxies is on the order of @xmath17 ( rubin et al 1991 ) , the galaxies appear to contain only @xmath18% of the total mass . � the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . � if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . � if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . � the shapes of compact groups were first investigated by arp ( 1973 ) who concluded that galaxy `` chains '' were unusually predominant . � if they are primarily projections noticed in visual searches � . it will be interesting to see if these results are confirmed by studies of groups found by automated searches . � if the intrinsic shapes of compact groups are related to their formation process , one might expect to see a relationship between the orientation angle of a group and the environment . � palumbo et al ( 1993 ) examined the environments of the hcgs , and found that the orientations of the major axes of the groups were consistent with an isotropic distribution . � if compact groups are not simply projection effects , they might be expected to show a centrally - concentrated surface density profile , as is seen in clusters of galaxies . although the number of galaxies in individual compact groups is small , with a large sample it is possible to estimate a mean profile . by scaling and superimposing � the hcgs , hickson et al ( 1984 ) found evidence for central concentration . � mendes de oliveira & girard ( 1994 ) , using a similar analysis , concluded that the mean surface density profile is consistent with a king ( 1962 ) model with typical core radius of 15@xmath19 kpc . � most recently , montoya et al ( 1996 ) have analyzed the profiles of the 42 hcg 22 for the hcgs ; prandoni et al ( 1994 ) obtain @xmath23 for the scgs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ both these values are substantially lower than those found for field galaxy samples ( @xmath24 , gisler 1980 , nilson 1973 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ also well established is morphological type concordance , observed in both the hcgs and scgs ( sulentic 1987 , hickson at al 1988b , prandoni et al 1994 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a given compact group is more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for a random distribution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ white ( 1990 ) has pointed out that such concordance could result from a correlation of morphological type with some other property of the group . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the strongest such correlation found to date is between morphological type and velocity dispersion ( hickson et al 1988b ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ as figure 3 shows , groups with higher velocity dispersions contain fewer late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ they also tend to be more luminous . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the importance of velocity dispersion , in addition to local density , on the galaxy morphology had previously been emphasized by de souza et al ( 1982 in their study ,  they examined a sample consisting of 10 hcg elliptical galaxies and detected nuclear emission in 11 of them .   they concluded that this high fraction suggests that interactions and mergers may be supplying gas to these galaxies .   they also concluded that there is no evidence of interactions and mergers in these galaxies .   they concluded that this idea received independent support from radio observations in which neutral hydrogen emission was detected in three compact groups which contain only elliptical galaxies ( huchtmeier 1994 ) .   they examined a sample consisting of 10 hcg elliptical galaxies and detected nuclear emission in 11 of them .   they examined a sample consisting of 10 hcg elliptical galaxies and detected nuclear emission in 11 of them .   they examined a sample consisting of 10 hcg elliptical galaxies and found that these galaxies are not elliptical in nature and that they therefore do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other elliptical galaxies .   they also found that this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies that have `` disky '' or irregular isophotes tend to have lower velocity dispersion .  they also found that hcg elliptical galaxies are less likely to have `` boxy - sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � obtained a luminosity function for hcg galaxies similar to that of field galaxies . � however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . � for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . � because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . � redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . � the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . � their best - fit luminosity function is deficient in faint galaxies , although a normal field - galaxy luminosity function is not excluded .    to avoid the selection problem , ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) obtained deeper photometry 1991 ) , particularly at the faint end , but it is not evident that the bias is sufficient to account for the apparent faint - galaxy deficit . � on the other hand , the small sample used by ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) may not be representative of compact groups in general . � on the other hand , mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1997 ) points out that the ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) sample has a spiral fraction of 0.60 , substantially higher than that of the whole hcg catalogue , and contains 7 of the 16 hcgs found to be in a high density environment by palumbo et al ( 1995 ) . � this suggests that the their sample has more than the usual amount of field galaxy contamination . � de carvalho et al ( 1994 ) , note that the faint galaxies form a more extended distribution than do the brighter galaxies . � thus they may be a dynamically distinct component , or simply unrelated field galaxies . � finally , the redshift - selected rscg sample also shows mild evidence for a faint galaxy deficiency . � while the faint end of the lf in compact groups appears to be depleted , there is evidence that the bright end may be enhanced . � a ratio of 3.3% . � for the rscgs , the figure is comparable : for groups of four or more galaxies , barton et al ( 1996 ) obtain a compact group abundance of @xmath34 mpc@xmath3 which leads to a luminosity density ratio of approximately 3% . � these are surprisingly high figures considering the short dynamical times of most compact groups . � evidence is accumulating that tidal interactions play an important role in triggering starburst activity in galaxies ( eg . � maccagni et al 1990 , campos - aguilar & moles 1991 , kormendy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � compact groups , with their high galaxy density and evident signs of galaxy interaction should be ideal systems in which to study such effects . � many hcgs do in fact contain galaxies showing starbursts or harboring active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . for example , hcg 16 is found to contain a seyfert 2 galaxy , two liners , and three starburst galaxies ( ribeiro et al 1996 , ribeiro et al 1996 ) . � hcg 31 contains five galaxies showing signs of recent star error . � analysis of improved data ( eg . allam et al 1996 ) should soon resolve questions about the identifications and infrared fluxes . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � zepf ( 1993 ) compared the ratio of 60 @xmath35 m to 100 @xmath35 m fluxes of compact group galaxies with those of isolated galaxies and also with those of galaxies believed to be currently merging . � he found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated spirals it originates in the disk . � if this is also true for the infrared flux , there must be an enhancement inwards toward the nucleus , resulting in enhanced star formation in the nuclear region , and possibly fueling an active nucleus .      although there is a clear example of tidal interaction stimulating disk radio emission in at least one compact group ( menon 1995a ) , statistical evidence for a link between interactions and radio emission in compact groups is only now accumulating .      if interactions are stimulating nuclear radio emission , one would expect the radio luminosity to be correlated with some index describing the degree of interaction such as the projected distance to the nearest neighbor .      evidence in support of this was found by vettolani & gregorini ( 1988 ) who observed that early - type galaxies which have a high ratio of radio - to - optical emission show an excess of nearby neighbors .      a similar effect was observed by malumian ( 1996 ) for spiral galaxies , menon ( 1992 ) found that elliptical and s0 galaxies detected at a wavelength of 20 cm had closer neighbors than the undetected galaxies .      the effect was not found for spiral galaxies , but if one considers only the detected galaxies , there is a significant correlation between radio - to - optical luminosity and nearest neighbor distance for both early and late type galaxies ( tk menon , private communication ) . al ( 1980 ) although these authors made no distinction between elliptical and spiral galaxies . � it is difficult to imagine any explanation for this result in which the compact group is not a true physical system . � it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . � it would appear that , regardless of absolute luminosity , only the first - ranked ( presumably the most massive in the group ) elliptical galaxy can develop a radio source . � stars stripped from galaxies by tidal forces should accumulate in the potential well of the group . and may be detectable as diffuse light . in an early photographic study , rose ( 1979 ) found no evidence for diffuse light in his groups , and was lead to the conclusion that most of his groups must be transient configurations . � however , bergvall et al ( 1981 ) were successful in detecting ionized gas and a common halo around a compact quartet of interacting early - type galaxies , and evidence for a common halo in vv 172 was reported by sulentic & lorre ( 1983 ) . � diffuse light can clearly be seen in hcg 94 , and has been radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . pointed rosat observations revealed massive hydrogen envelopes surrounding the ngc 2300 group , a bright elliptical - spiral pair with two fainter members ( mulchaey et al 1993 ) , and hcg 62 , a compact quartet of early - type galaxies ( ponman & bertram 1993 ) , and showed that these systems are dominated by dark matter . � subsequent investigations detected x - rays from 18 additional compact groups , either from individual galaxies , or from diffuse gas ( ebeling et al 1994 , pildis et al 1995a , sarraco & ciliegi 1995 , sulentic et al 1995 ) . � these studies showed that the physical properties of individual systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . � moreover , the detected compact groups all contained a majority of early - type galaxies . � no spiral - rich groups were detected ( although mulchaey et al 1996b pointed out that they might be found from qso absorption spectra ) . � this result is consistent with the fact that x - ray - selected groups ( henry et al 1995 ) and loose groups ( mulchaey et al 1996a ) . � pildis et al ( 1995 ) derived baryon fractions of 12 - 19% . � davis et al ( 1996 ) obtains 10 - 16% for the ngc 2300 group . these are comparable to the fractions found for poor clusters ( dellantonio et al ( 1995 ) and are about half the typical values found for rich clusters � . however , the derived baryon fraction depends sensitively on the radius within which it is measured and on the assumed background level ( henriksen & mamon 1994 ) . � the baryon fraction is comparable to both the total mass , which is dominated by dark matter , and the gas mass continue to increase with radius . consequently , both the baryon fraction and the gas fraction are poorly determined . � the contribution of compact groups to the x - ray luminosity function has been estimated by pbeb , who find that on the order of 4% of the total luminosity in the range @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 comes from hcgs . � this is higher than the contribution of hcg galaxies to the local optical luminosity density estimated at 0.8% by mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) .      if the frequency of discordant galaxies is inconsistent with the statistics of chance projection , it might signify the need for new physical theories ( arp 1987 ) , or for gravitational amplification of background galaxies ( hammer & nottale 1986 ) .     the initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) .        however , such probabilities were recognized to be difficult to determine reliably , because the a priori probability of _ any _ particular configuration of galaxies is also very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) . only with a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects ,     can meaningful estimates of the probabilities be made .           the explicit selection criteria of the hcg catalog in principal makes this sample suitable for a quantitative statistical investigation of the discordant - redshift question . sulentic ( 1987 )    sulentic ( 1987 ) ( kent 1981 , wu et al 1994 ) . physical binaries ( mamon 1995 ) . � the high fraction of hcgs showing diffuse x - ray emission is very strong evidence that a large fraction of these systems are physically dense , and are not transient configurations or projection effects . although the exact numbers are not final , due to the faintness of the sources and the problems of contamination by sources associated with the individual galaxies , it seems evident that many groups are dense bound systems . � the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties , and the fact that the x - ray properties of compact groups are not inconsistent with those of clusters reinforces this conclusion . � the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties , and the fact that the x - ray properties of compact groups are not inconsistent with those of clusters reinforces this conclusion . � the correlations seen between x - ray and optical properties are not inconsistent with those of clusters . � ostriker et al ( 1995 ) have argued that the relatively low x - ray luminosities of compact groups might not be due to a low gas fraction , but instead could be understood if the groups are filaments seen in projection ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . however , ponman et al ( 50 and @xmath51 . � here we have neglected a small edge contribution that is unimportant for small values of @xmath52 ( walke and mamon s case 3 ) . � this gives f(x , n ) = n^2 x^2n-2 now , an observer would infer a galaxy space density that is higher by a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 n^2 x^2n-5 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor of 12.0 for triplets ( or quartets containing a physical binary ) , 3.2 for true quartets fit in this picture ? � recent studies ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian et al 1988 , 1991 , amirkhanian 1989 , kodaira et al 1988 - 91 , stoll et al 1993 - 1996 ) show that these objects are typically compact clusters or groups of early - type galaxies . � although the systems were selected on the basis of red colors and compact appearance of their galaxies , both of these factors result from their large distances because k - corrections and contrast effects become significant . � the galaxies are in fact relatively normal , although luminous ( del olmo et al 1995 ) . � however , the number of blue ( gas rich ) galaxies in these systems does seem to be very small . � thus it appears the shakhbazian groups are mostly small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . � if the groups are dynamically bound , galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times ( carnevali et al 1981 , ishizawa et al 1983 , barnes 1985 , ishizawa 1986 , mamon 1987 , 1990 , zheng et who found that the luminosities of first - ranked galaxies were consistent with a single luminosity distribution for all group galaxies . of course � this may just mean that in small groups the first - ranked galaxy is not necessarily the most evolved . � rather , one should ask if _ any _ galaxies in compact groups show indications of merging . � the relative paucity of merging galaxies in compact groups was first noted by tikhonov ( 1987 ) , from a visual inspection of optical images . � zepf & whitmore ( 1991 ) realized that elliptical galaxies formed by recent mergers of gas - rich systems should have bluer colors than normal . � examining the hcgs , they found only a small enhancement in the fraction of early - type galaxies having blue colors , a conclusion reinforced by an independent study by moles et al ( 1994 ) . on � the other hand , caon et al ( 1994 ) argued that the large effective radii of compact group elliptical galaxies is indicative of an origin by merging or accretion of companions . � zepf ( 1993 ) estimated that roughly 7% of the galaxies in compact groups are in the process of merging . � this conclusion was based on roughly consistent frequencies of et al 1995 ) in which we find strong gravitational interactions . at the other end \u001c are lower density compact groups , such as hcg 44 , which most likely are in a less - advanced stage of evolution .  embodiments this picture is supported by radio observations : seyfert s sextet and hcg 31 are both embedded in extended hi clouds whereas in hcg 44 the hi is associated with individual galaxies ( williams et al 1991 ) .  embodiments it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time .  embodiments it seems clear that merging should destroy the group on a time scale @xmath54 that is typically an order of magnitude larger than @xmath55 , depending on the distribution of dark matter ( cavaliere et al 1983 , barnes 1984 , navarro et al 1987 , kodaira et al 1990 ) and initial conditions ( governato et al 1991 ) . assuming that the groups are in fact bound dynamical systems  embodiments it can draw two conclusions : _ ( a ) _ there must be an ongoing mechanism for forming or replacing compact groups , and _ ( b )  embodiments _ there must be a significant population of relics of merged groups . by at least a factor of two , and may be underestimated because of selection biases .     if there is then the potential problem of producing too many relics .      a second problem is the fact that the integrated luminosities of compact groups are typically a factor of three to four times greater than luminosities of isolated elliptical galaxies ( sulentic and rabaa 1994 ) .    it is possible that interaction - induced star formation has boosted the luminosities of some compact - group galaxies , and that some degree of fading of the merger product is expected .     however , at this point it is not clear whether or not the relics can be identified with isolated elliptical galaxies .    despite these problems , a fossil compact group may have actually been found .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have detected a luminous isolated elliptical galaxy surrounded by diffuse x - ray emission which is consistent with the expected end - product of a compact group .    ponman et al ( 1995 ) have detected a luminous isolated elliptical galaxy surrounded by diffuse x - ray emission which is consistent with the expected end - product of a compact group .    ponman et al ai 1994 , hutchings 1995 , hutchings et al 1995 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these observations provide support to the idea that tidally - triggered star formation is a predominant factor in the galaxy formation process ( lacey & silk 1991 , lacey et al 1993 ) . in this model disk star formation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( schade et al 1995 ) , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath59 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ compact groups may possibly play a role in the formation of other systems . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . at the other end of the scale , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a unique formation mechanism . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one possibility is that they form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris ( duc & mir systems 5 - 10 times more distant should produce a non - negligible fraction of giant arcs .     studies of small groups may provide clues to the overall structure of the universe .     the baryon fractions found in clusters of galaxies appear to be inconsistent with a density parameter @xmath60 , unless the dark matter is more prevalent outside clusters ( white 1992 , babul & katz 1993 ) .    the baryon fractions found in compact groups provide a means to study dark matter in such regions .     the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .    the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .     david et al ( 1995 ) argued that the gas is the most extended component ; galaxies being the most compact and the dark matter being intermediate .     they concluded that the baryon fraction approaches 30% on large enough scales , which is comparable to the values found for clusters .     they concluded that given the constraints of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis this would imply that the density parameter @xmath61 is at most 0.2 . What is their role in the evolution of galaxies and what is their role in the evolution of galaxies both past and present ? given the current interest and research activity in this area , it is likely that many of these questions may soon be addressed . press [ b]ahcall na , harris de , rood hj . � _ 284:l29-l33 [ b]aier fw , petrosian , mb , tiersch h , shakhbazian rk . � _ astrofizika _ 10:327 - 35 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1975 . � _ astrofizika _ 11:221 - 28 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1975 . � _ astrofizika _ 11:221 - 28 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1976 . _ astrofizika _ 12:7 - 12 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1976 . _ astrofizika _ 12:409 - 15 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1978 . � _ astrofizika _ 14:279 - 82 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . � _ astrofizika _ 14:279 - 82 [ b]aier fw , tiersch h. 1979 . � _ astrofizika _ , casoli f. 1996 . � _ 314:738 - 44 [ b]riel ug , henry jp . 1995 . � astrophys . _ 302:l9-l12 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr . � 130:23 - 25 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:541 - 50 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:244 - 47 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:244 - 47 [ b]urbidge em . , burbidge gr � 134:248 - 56 [ b]urbidge em , sargent wlw . 1971 . � 35:351 - 78 [ c]ampos - aguilar a , m zky rf , burstein d. 1996 .

since the box is periodic , scaling to larger numbers of galaxies is linear . � parameter fitting requires weighting the data points according to how independent they are , with two highly independent points contributing more than two less independent points all else equal . � the covariance matrix describes how independent the measured multipoles at each @xmath123 are . for our algorithm to be useful � we must show that the covariance matrix can be controlled ;

resonance region , @xmath202 is still fairly small in comparison to the hard scale . on the other hand ,    the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) at such a value of @xmath22 is already larger than the qcd scale @x the case of a pseudoscalar kaon in the following . � neglecting the small penguin coefficients @xmath134 and adapting the expressions in @xcite to our notation , the second contribution reads ( @xmath207 ) @xmath208\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the ope limit , defined by treating @xmath209 and taking ( [ q2eklambda ] ) , we have @xmath210 . � this term is therefore subleading with respect to ( [ dela9h5 ] ) , consistent with the absence of a @xmath211 term in @xmath176 . � the remaining term is given by @xmath212 where ( @xmath213 ) @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 the formulas from @xcite have been slightly rewritten here to make them more convenient for application in the high-@xmath2 region where @xmath219 . to make contact with the ope result we eliminate @xmath2 from ( [ tpardef ] ) using @xmath220 and expand in @xmath221 . � the terms proportional to @xmath222 and @xmath223 cancel and we find real part of the ope approximation is @xmath232 larger in magnitude than the qcdf result , for the imaginary part the discrepancy is about @xmath233 .  embodiments such differences are to be expected since the expansion leading from qcdf to the ope is governed by @xmath234 . within this accuracy  embodiments , the ope formula still gives a very good estimate of the more complete qcdf result at @xmath169 . for larger values of @xmath2  embodiments the numerical difference between the two sides in ( [ da9ph5 ] ) becomes smaller and towards the endpoint the ope is the more appropriate description .  embodiments the above exercise suggests that even at @xmath2 as low as @xmath201 the ope is a valid method to obtain the second - order correction ( [ dela9h5 ] ) .  embodiments the difference with the qcdf estimate is immaterial in view of the very small overall size of the effect .  embodiments the transition from large to small recoil energy has already been considered in @xcite for the @xmath28 form factor ratio @xmath235 .  embodiments the above exercise suggests that even at @xmath2 as low as @xmath201 @xmath242 gives rise to a loop -

loop contribution .     in correspondence with ( [ psiz312 ] ) we have assumed @xmath389 to be real . using the approximation in ( [ defd2 ] ) and proceeding as in ( [ dvrate ] )    we find @xmath404 this formula gives an excellent approximation of the full result based on ( [ rdv1def ] ) .    in correspondence with ( [ psiz312 ] ) we note the ( mild ) exponential suppression and the power suppression by @xmath405 . d2 ] ) . � the approximate form and the full result in ( [ rdv2 ] ) agree reasonably well . with our set of parameters we find @xmath418 at @xmath419 , about half the size of @xmath410 . � the phenomenological value @xmath406 used above is larger than the perturbative result for the coefficient @xmath389 . � thus it effectively absorbs the ( partly unknown ) effects from factorizable and non - factorizable corrections . � we should emphasize here that the analytic structure of the latter is , in general , more complicated than it is implied by the approximation to @xmath420 in ( [ khfact ] ) . � the phenomenological value of @xmath389 in our numerical estimate of duality violation thus corresponds to the pessimistic scenario where the oscillating terms from the non - factorizable corrections to the charm - loop are added coherently . in reality � we expect that at least some destructive interference between the various contributions appears , and the amount of duality violation should even be smaller than our estimate . � our model for the charm - loop in ( [ khfact ] ) is similar to the ansatz originally proposed in @xcite and used since the systematics and the typical size of the effect , which presumably is closely connected with the @xmath13 resonance structure in the charm -

dimensional operators generated by ( [ kh6c ] ) , that is operators with more factors of the gluon field and its derivatives , the coefficients will scale as inverse powers of @xmath351 . � a similar situation exists for inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , where four - quark operators with charm , analogous to ( [ kh6c ] ) , also appear at third order in the ope for @xmath424 . � the effect of the corresponding charm loops has been refered to as intrinsic charm in @xcite , where the issue was discussed in great detail . � the above consideration indicates how the nonperturbative @xmath433 matrix element of operators such as ( [ kh6c ] ) can be treated in an expansion in @xmath434 . � however , as demonstrated in @xcite for semi - leptonic @xmath432 decays , the same effects [ abmll ] ) . ille is entirely negligible . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have clarified the relationship between the ope at high @xmath2 and qcd factorization at low @xmath2 by showing that both descriptions yield consistent results at intermediate values of @xmath30 . * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a relevant topic at high @xmath2 is the issue of quark - hadron duality , which is closely related to the existence of an ope . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have defined the ope with the help of a spurion momentum that allows for an independent scaling of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath453 and kaon energy . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this allows one to clarify the analytic structure of the matrix elements of the correlator ( [ khconcl ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then employed a model based on an infinite series of charm resonances to estimate quantitatively the amount of duality violation , resulting in about @xmath329 for the rate integrated over the high-@xmath2 region . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ an important aspect is the different sensitivity to duality violation of the contributions to the rate linear or quadratic in @xmath443 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the quadratic term is more vulnerable to duality violation , but numerically suppressed as a term of second order in the to @xmath456 or @xmath457 . � we show that the ope of @xmath76 in ( [ khdef ] ) and ( [ khdef ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath458 at the level of dimension-3 and dimension-4 operators in full qcd , in the chiral limit @xmath91 . for @xmath101 , @xmath459 \u001c we show that in the chiral limit @xmath111 , right - handed strange quarks can also appear , together with a suppression factor of @xmath103 . \u001c this leads to the two additional operators @xmath460 and @xmath461 in ( [ o41 ] ) and ( [ o42 ] ) , which can be counted as operators of dimension 4 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the matrix elements of @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 between @xmath111 and @xmath464 are all given by the standard @xmath428 form factors . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the matrix elements of @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 between @xmath111 and @xmath464 are all given by the standard @x or similar identities .    for @xmath480 exactly three structures can be formed : @xmath476 this can be seen as follows . for @xmath477 in ( [ opdim3 ] ) � the only possibility is the third operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .    for @xmath478 we obtain the first operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath479 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .    for @xmath480 we can write the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .    for @xmath478 we obtain the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath479 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .    for @xmath480 we obtain the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath478 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ opdim3b ] ) .    for @xmath480 we obtain the second operator in ( [ opdim3b ] ) and @xmath478 which is equivalent to the third term in ( [ .   with @xmath490 the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmaa ] )  is equivalent to ( [ sigmab ] ) and ( [ oneqq ] ) , and ( [ oneqq ] ) reduces to ( [ sigmac ] ) .   with @xmath490 the r.h.s . of ( [ sigmab ] ) is equivalent to ( [ gammab ] ) and ( [ oneqq ] ) , and ( [ sigmac ] ) reduces to ( [ sigmaa ] ) .    this completes the proof that all operators of dimension 3 and 4 , ( [ opdim3 ] ) and ( [ opdim4 ] ) , can be expressed in terms of ( [ opdim3b ] ) for @xmath91 .    with @xmath91 taking current conservation into account leaves us with @xmath462 and @xmath463 in ( [ o31o32 ] ) .    with @xmath91 taking current conservation into account leaves us with @xmath462 and @xmath463 in ( [ o31o32 ] ) .    similar arguments hold if @xmath468 is replaced by @x s=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] _ , arxiv:0709.0451 [ hep -

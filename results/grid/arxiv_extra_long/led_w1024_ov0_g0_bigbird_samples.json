body terms are treated on equal footing . in this model ,<n> the coupling between the two quarks is proportional to the square of the one - body term in the effective lagrangian . using this model<n> , we find that the measured value of the coefficient is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction . <n> recently , the observation of anomalous diffusion in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies has attracted a lot of attention @xcite . to understand the mechanism of the phenomenon , it is useful to consider the coupling of the quarks to the matter field . for this purpose , in the framework of effective lagrangians , two - particle correlations<n> are considered , i.e. , particle - particle and particle - hole correlations are expressed in terms of two effective couplings , one to each quark in the system and the other to the hole , with the coupling constants depending on the density of the matter . in this letter , we present results of a calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment ( am ) of the muon in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at sps energies .<n> we use the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) for the collision term , and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory for the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction term . <n> we find that the am is dominated by the so interaction , with a small contribution from the ria - rmf interaction . in the case of heavy ions ,<n> our results are in agreement with the recent measurements of the am by the cleo collaboration @xcite , showing that the angular distribution of the emitted muon is consistent with an isotropic distribution @xmath0 , as predicted by the rmf theory . for light ions<n> , our results indicate a deviation from this angular distribution , which can be attributed to the effects of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) on the spin of the electron , or to the effect of the qgp on the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , both of which are in contradiction with the experimental data . as a result we present a family of infrared stable fixed points for the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory recently proposed in @xcite .<n> these fixed points are classified according to the directions of the nonvanishing couplings and support the proposed duality . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) non - perturbatively coupled to gauge field perturbations in the infrared ( ir ) domain . in this work ,<n> we provide a solution for the ir super yang - mills theory ( ijsmt ) in the presence of an additional @xmath0 gauge interaction , which is shown to be proportional to the infrared cutoff of the theory . as a result , the infrared fixed point for the theory considered in the present work is infrared stable and corresponds to the proposed infrared stable ir dual of super qcd ( sqcd ) , while the last one corresponds to seiberg s magnetic dual and it is the only one with all non - vanishing couplings . for a complete description of the infrared and ir properties of super , super - qcd as well as super - qcd<n> , it is we study the perturbative and supersymmetric fixed points of an @xmath0 super yang - mills theory .<n> we find that a subset of the bare couplings generates a variety of fixed points including seiberg s magnetic dual as well as super qcd and super susybz fixed points . <n> address = department of physics , the ohio state university , columbus , oh 43210 , usa , altaddress = institut fr theoretische teilchenphysik , universitt karlsruhe , d-76128 , germany address = sissa , via beirut 2 -

[ tbl ] , where we show that the result for the fermi constant in the sm is in good agreement with the result of the non - perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation . for the couplings ,<n> the rg result is in excellent agreement with , and has been for a long time the correct result : @x in this work we present a general method to compute the hamiltonian matrix of a quantum particle interacting with its environment .<n> the method is based on the solution of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations , which allows us to obtain the matrix in closed form . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the computation of the energy spectrum of a bose - einstein condensate in one dimension . <n> _ introduction _ the study of quantum systems with many degrees of freedom has a long history , going back to the work of hilbert and einstein @xcite . in recent years<n> the interest in quantum systems has grown considerably , both for theoretical and practical reasons . from a practical point of view<n> it is important to understand the behaviour of the quantum system under the influence of the environment , in particular how the system responds to the presence of quantized fields , and how the dynamics of the system is influenced by the quantization of the field . to this end<n> there has been a considerable amount of work on the subject , especially in the context of wave - particle duality , where it has been shown that the wave function of an open quantum system can be written as a weighted sum of we derive a generalized form of the chern - simons - bethe - salpeter ( cs - bs ) equation , which is a generalization of the well - known cs equation .<n> we show that this generalized equation can be written as a system of @xmath0 matrices , where each matrix is associated with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian , and each matrix has a 1d eigenvalue . by solving this system of equations<n> , we find that the 1d cs equations can be replaced by a set of 2d equations , each of which has the same eigenvalues , but a different set of 1d coupling constants . <n> _ introduction : _ in this paper we derive an expression for the generalized cs ( gcs)-type equation @xcite , the generalized version of the cs theory that has been extensively studied in the literature . here<n> we deal with 1d and 2d hamiltonians , both of which have been used extensively in the study of quantum transport in condensed matter systems . in the theory of transport ,<n> the aim is to describe the transport properties of a system we present a new method for extracting the phase - space density profile of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from the measurement of the scattering cross - section .<n> the method is based on the use of an analytic model that takes into account all the scattering processes in the condensate , and is valid for both non - interacting and strongly interacting condensates . as an example , we apply the method to the case of a bec interacting with an atomic condensate . <n> pacs numbers : : we show that yukawa couplings of the form @xmath0 arise naturally in the theory of supersymmetry breaking in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we compute the masses of the lightest neutral higgs boson and the width of the supersymmetric lightest cp - odd phase , and find them to be in good agreement with the current experimental bounds . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard model @xcite . in this scenario ,<n> the breaking of the gauge symmetry is mediated by the exchange of a new gauge boson , the higgs , which couples to the gauge field of the sm and to the fermion fields of the theory . at the electroweak scale , where susy is expected to be broken , it is expected that the gauge bosons are massive and neutral , while at the tev scale the superpartners of the bosons should be massless and charged . as a result , supersymmetry can be broken only at the weak scale . however , this scale is not the only scale at which susy can be realized . on the other hand , in the m we show that the higgs potential in the standard model with a @xmath0 gauge group has a non - trivial vacuum structure .<n> the vacuum is characterized by a negative quartic potential , with a positive quartic and negative quadratic potentials , and a zero potential at the origin . in the infrared limit ,<n> the infrared stable fixed point is the only stable physical point . as a result , there is no vacuum instability . <n> one of the most important problems in particle physics today is to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . to this end<n> , it is crucial to understand how the electroweak interactions evolve in time , in particular how the vacuum structure of the theory evolves with time . at the infrared ( ir ) scale , where the theory is expected to be stable , the vacuum energy density is much larger than the sum of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the gauge and higgs fields . for a given vev , this difference between the vacuum and the physical vacuum<n> is called the renormalization group ( rg ) effect @xcite . on the other hand , for a",

armed grand design spirals and 17 are three - armed spirals . in the process of selecting the list of galaxies for this investigation , it was possible to identify a few galaxies with grand design spiral structure but with no clear clear two -armed spiral structure . among the 29 galaxies with two - arm grand design structure , there are two galaxies with clear three - arm spiral structure as well as several galaxies with more complex spiral structure than the grand design , including a galaxy with a bar and a counter - rotating disk , and a galaxy that appears to be in the early stages of a major merger . the 50 largest galaxies are shown to be a mixture of grand - design spirals , flocculent spirals with small bar components , compact spirals with large bar components and compact spirals that do not show any of the above characteristics . as is well known , the presence of a bar in a this paper describes the surface photometry and morphology of a sample of nearby early -

armed grand - design spirals ( see lynden - bell et al . 1994 , lynd - bell & lyndan - bell 1997 )<n> . the outer spiral structure may be fainter than the inner arms , but the two patterns are not clearly distinguished . of the galaxies in the sample , about half have an inner and an outer pattern , with the former having a figure we report the first high - resolution ( @xmath0 ) , high - signal - to - noise ( 2.5 ) imaging of the spiral structure of nearby galaxies .<n> the data were obtained with the hubble space telescope s wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) using the wide field , near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( wfc / nicmos ) at the u. s. naval observatory s flagstaff observatory . <n> we present the results for a sample of 19 galaxies , ranging in hubble type from sa to sd , covering a range in stellar mass from @xcite to @x . for each galaxy<n> , we measured the surface brightness at the outer extent of the optically luminous spiral structure , as well as the ratio of the inner and outer spiral extents , and found that most galaxies have values of the ratio less than unity , which is consistent with spiral density wave theory ( spiral structure bounded by the lindblad resonances ) and the fact that most rotation curves are approximately flat ( grand design spirals are approximately two - armed , with the outer spiral arm being brighter than the inner spiral arm ) the ratio of the two - armed spiral pattern speed in a galaxy s disk , [ eq_ilrcr ] , is an important indicator of the morphology of the galaxy . in this study<n> , we present a study of the distribution of the values of the equation [ iq_ilrolr]]/[eq_lrcr]@xmath0 as a function of galaxy morphology .<n> the galaxies were selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 1 . <n> we present the results for a sample of 31 galaxies , ranging in morphology from pure spirals to barred and ringed galaxies . for each galaxy ,<n> we have measured the @xmath1-band surface brightness distribution , the disk scale length , and the disk - to - total light ratio , as well as the velocity dispersion and velocity anisotropy of the light distribution . from these data<n> we derive the following results : (1 ) . the _ mean _ ratio of pure spiral galaxies to those with a bar or ring is 0.78 , which is close to the value expected from modal theory ; (2  galaxies with two - armed , grand design spiral patterns in their optical rotation curves ( rts ) have , on average , lower resonance ratios between the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) and the outer lindlund resonance ( olr , @xmath0 ) than non - barred galaxies .<n> the reason for this may be that barred galaxies tend to have a limited spiral extent , which limits the extent of the ilr and the presence of inner rings . <n> galaxies with a bar tend to also have an inner ring circumscribing the bar , although it is not clear if the inner ring is related to the end of the bar or the inner 4:1 resonance . for barred spirals ,<n> the equation [ eq_ilrolr]/@xmath1 ratio is lower than for unbarred spirals by about a factor of two , and the ratio of the ratio between inner 4:1 and outer 4:1 is also lower by about the same factor . in a companion paper<n> , we will examine the shapes of the t - r plane for barred and unbarred galaxies and compare them with those of the galaxy population as a whole . this paper describes an observational project that examined 140 spiral galaxies , measuring the visual extent of their spiral structure . the purpose of the project was to find galaxies for which the corotation resonance of the two - armed grand design spiral structure was likely to be within the bright optical disk .<n> it appears that barred and ringed spirals statistically have more limited spiral extent than pure spirals . <n> [ 1996/06/01 ] a&a we present an analysis of the properties of a complete sample of nearby ( @xmath0 ) barred galaxies selected from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .<n> this sample is complete to the redshift limit of z@xmath11.5 , which corresponds to z=0.7 for the milky way . <n> the ned sample was selected on the basis of the following criteria : ( 1 ) a redshift completeness of more than 90% , ( 2 ) photometric redshift information , and ( 3 ) the absence of a galaxy in the vicinity of one of the galaxies in the sample . for the sample as a whole ,<n> we have determined the following properties : 1 . the number density of galaxies per unit redshift is a monotonically increasing function of redshift , with a power - law index @xcite , similar to that found by van albada & roberts ( 1981 ) for a sample of _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) galaxies ; 2 . there is a positive correlation between the number of galaxies in a galaxy and its velocity dispersion , @x we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of hi - selected galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 .<n> the sample was selected from the shapley - ames ( s@xmath1 ) and the huchtmeier - richter ( hf ) hi surveys , and has a median redshift of @xcite . <n> we present a list of the spectroscopic redshifts for the hi selected galaxies of the survey , along with their h - band magnitudes and reddenings . for each galaxy ,<n> we calculate the mean redshift , the mean velocity dispersion , a metallicity - corrected velocity dispersion and a sed . the mean metallicity and the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in our sample are found to be consistent with those of the milky way and the magellanic clouds , respectively , within the errors . in the case of the hf hi survey<n> , we find that the metallicity of galaxies is correlated with the galaxy luminosity , but not with the mean galaxy color , contrary to what is expected in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . as a result of this correlation , galaxies with low we present a new catalog of _ hubble space telescope _<n> ( _ hst _ ) observations of bright early - type galaxies .<n> the new catalog , which supersedes the catalog of de vaucouleurs , paturel , & fouque ( 1991 ) , is intended to be complete for redshifts @xmath0 , but it can be used for other purposes , such as galaxy evolution studies . in this paper<n> , we present new hst observations of a sample of 19 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) bright galaxy sample ( bgs , vazzi et al . <n> 1993 , sellwood & kahn 1991 , sparke & davies 1988 , toomre 1978 ) and the cambridge university bright galaxy survey ( cbgs , fall & bell 1976 , corwin 1978 , de vaucouleur & tooa 1977 )<n> . the galaxies were observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the f606w and f850lp filters , and with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2  in recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of magnetic fields in space .<n> magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe , being responsible for about @xmath0 of the total energy of the universe @xcite . in most of these cases<n> the magnetic field is so strong that it can not be described by a simple lorentzian vector , but it is usually assumed to be a power - law function of distance . however , in some cases the field can be highly non - gaussian , characterised by steep gradients , anomalous magnetic field strengths , and even discontinuities in the field s characteristics . here<n> we show that these characteristics are related to the so - called  anomalous magnetic fields '' , i.e. , magnetic fields that are much weaker than gauss s field . <n> the presence of a large number of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields has been reported in the last few years , both observationally and theoretically , see e.g. refs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15  we study the stellar dynamics of the dwarf nova , sgrs 1915 + 105 , which exploded in the dense environment of the galaxy s nucleus .<n> we find that the supernova explosion was triggered by a massive star , and that the star was ejected from the centre of its parent galaxy , about @xmath0 years after the explosion . <n> the central regions of dwarf novae ( dne ) are highly enriched in heavy elements , due to the large number of supernovae ( sn ) that have been triggered in the centres of their host galaxies in the past few decades . in the early universe , when the density of galaxies was very high ,<n> sn explosions were common @xcite . since then , more and more massive stars have been discovered in the centers of galaxies as well as in the bulges of galaxies , leading to an increase in the number of sn in the galactic bulge . as a result<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of sn explosions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , as these are potential progenitors of type ia supernovae . for a long time , it was thought that it is shown that the relative motion between the two arms of a compact binary system can lead to rapid oscillation of the system .<n> this oscillation can be caused by the interaction of the two components , e.g. , in a binary system with a compact core , or in a compact baryonic cloud . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of binary systems with compact objects , such as neutron stars , stellar mass black holes , white dwarfs , neutron stars and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . in such systems ,<n> the interaction between the components leads to a rapid oscillation , which can be due to either ( i ) a global phase shift of the components or ( ii ) internal dynamics of the component . for the latter case<n> , it has been suggested that the internal dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator , due to the interaction with the internal degrees of freedom of the binary system , for example , by means of the kuramoto - sugimoto model @xcite . as such , the damping of the oscillation is of great importance for the understanding of the dynamics of these systems  we present a new method to determine the number of quanta per nucleon in a nucleon - nucleon collision .<n> the method is based on the lyapunov exponents of the total cross section for a collision of two nucleons , which are determined by the sum of the cross sections of the individual nucleons in each pair of nucleon beams . by using this method ,<n> it is possible to calculate the total number of nucleons as a function of collision energy . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of collisions of two or more nucleons with nuclei , due to the possibility of using these collisions as probes for the nucleon structure , as well as for the investigation of the interaction between the nucleons and the surrounding medium . in this context<n> , it is well - known that the collision energy of a single nucleon with a surrounding medium is much larger than that of a proton or a neutron , and can be expressed as @xmath0 , where the value of the center - of - mass energy is defined by @xcite . as a result , for a proton - proton collision , the total nucleon number is much smaller than the sum we study the effect of gravitational field on the dynamics of relativistic stars in binary systems .<n> we focus on the effects of the coupling between the orbital angular momentum of the central star and the gravitational field of the binary system . for a relativistic binary system consisting of two stars with equal mass<n> , we consider the case of a binary system which is initially non - relativistic and evolves according to the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sd ) hierarchy . in this case , the gravitational potential of the two stars is assumed to be proportional to the angular momentum transfer rate @xmath0 of the system , and the mass ratio between the stars is considered to be equal to unity . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the study of relativistic binary systems with central stars , due to the fact that these systems are expected to be gravitationally bound and form stars @xcite , as well as being the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) , see e.g. refs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 for recent reviews . however , it is well - known that the initial state of the star , i. we report the results of high resolution optical spectroscopy of the galactic halo objects ngc2535 , ugca , and ugc05685 .<n> these objects are selected to study the radial dependence of the metallicity in the halo of the galaxy . for these objects<n> we have found that the radial metallicity profile can be well described by a power law with an exponent @xmath0 , which is in good agreement with the result of monte carlo simulations . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the metal enrichment in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , due to its possible implications for the nature of the halos and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite . in this letter<n> , we investigate the dependence of metallicity on the radial extent of the distribution of the surface density of the ism in the central part of these halos , in order to test the applicability of the local density approximation ( lda ) to metal enrichment measurements in galactic haloes . to this aim ,<n> we use the  extended lda ' ( elda)@xcite to calculate the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is characterized by a spectral index of @xmath0 , with a mean value of -0.73 .<n> the agb is thought to be close to its eigenfrequencies at the end of its agb evolution . in this paper<n> we study the spectral index distribution of the optically bright agb globular clusters ( gcs ) in the period between 100 and 5000 s of agb phase with the aim of investigating the possible dependence of the index on the eigenspectra of the clusters . <n> recently , there has been increasing interest in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the agn spectral index ( ssi ) as a function of time , i.e. , as a _<n> golden rule _ <n> , see e.g. refs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 ,17 ,18 ,19 ,20 ,21 ,22 ,23 ,24 ,26 , 27 , 28  we propose a new method to measure the transverse profile of the electron distribution in a nucleus .<n> the method is based on the study of the transverse profiles of electrons propagating through a dense medium . as a result<n> , the electron density profile can be determined with high accuracy . using this method ,<n> we show that the electron profile measured in the nucleus can be quite different from that measured in a normal solid . <n> the electron profiles in nuclei are determined by a number of physical quantities , such as the electron mean free path , electron density , density of states , as well as the velocity of the electrons relative to the nucleus center of mass . in some cases<n> these quantities are determined very precisely , while in others they are rather approximated , e.g. , by the mean of simple analytical formulas . for example , in nuclear matter<n> the mean free paths of electrons are measured as a function of electron density and electron temperature , and are found to be gaussian , exponential , power - law , log - normal , logarithmic , etc ..<n> these relations are typical for nuclei , but they can also be approximated by simple analytical formulae .",

fold degenerate orbits in a spherically symmetric one - parameter family of oscillator potentials , i.e. , a purely quartic oscillator potential @xmath0 .<n> we find that these bifurcating orbits can be described by a family of circle orbits , each of which is exactly bifurcated when the maximum angular momentum of the system is equal to the maximum value of the angular velocity of the corresponding circle orbit . in the neighbourhood of the energy where the circle orbits bifurcate , we have to replace the sum of the diverging circle orbit contribution and the corresponding torus contribution with a common uniform contribution . here<n> , however , one has to include hereby also the contributions of so - called  ghost orbits '' , which are the imaginary ( or complex ) continuations of the bi furcated orbits to the other side of thebifurcation . <n> we evaluate numerically the semiclassical trace formula in the vicinity of the energies of the circle and ghost orbits as well as in the centre part of the spectrum of the oscillator potential , and show that it is well - suited for the present system . [ [ section ] ] the semi we present a semiclassical theory of a perturbed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , consisting of two coupled oscillators , one of which is on a circle orbit , and the other on a diameter orbit .<n> we show that the bifurcations of the circle orbits from the repeated circle orbits are absent in this system , so that the semiclassical trace formula for the diameters and circles is valid . for the circle orbit<n> , we find that the frequency ratio @xmath0 depends only weakly on the energy , while for the diameter orbit it increases linearly with energy . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of gravitational waves @xcite , gravitational waves ( gws ) have been the subject of a great deal of interest in both theoretical and experimental physics . in the field of gravitational wave astronomy ,<n> the gw phenomenon is one of the most important phenomena , since it is the origin of the gravitational wave background , the so - called  gw desert '' , in the visible spectrum of the earth s gravitational field . from the point of view of fundamental physics , it is also an important phenomenon , because it is responsible for the existence of we investigate the gross - shell structure of the anharmonically perturbed three - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator ( ho ) in the semiclassical limit @xmath0 .<n> we derive a semiclassical trace formula for the density of states that is valid for arbitrary central potentials and arbitrary values of anharmonicities and repetition numbers . for the ho hamiltonian , we find that the gross shell structure is dominated by the periodic orbits of diameter and circle shape , whose interference explains the findings from the numerical hartree - fock results . in a first step ,<n> we have used the perturbative approach of creagh @xcite to describe the symmetry breaking u(3 ) limit of the unperturbed ho system , resulting in a uniform trace formula in the limit of weak anharmonsities . it uniformly restores the u(3) limit , yielding the exact trace formula of the non - perturbed system . next we have discussed the mechanism by which the ratio of radial to angular frequency of the diameter orbit is naturally selected by a property of the general radial action integral , which appears to be universal for regular spherical potentials . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , hartree we study the periodic orbits in a woods - saxon potential in three spatial dimensions .<n> we find that the spectrum is dominated by the three - fold degenerate orbits of next - to - leading order in @xmath0 , i.e. , the diameter and circle orbits . <n> we reproduce the semiclassical trace formula of balian and bloch @xcite for a spherical cavity potential , with ideally reflecting walls , and find qualitatively the numerical quantum - mechanical hf results for harmonically trapped fermionic atom gases . #<n> 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#1 it has been known for some time now that a harmonically - trapped , harmonic - oscillator - like potential can be used as a model for a quantum system , for instance in connection with the physics of metal clusters . in particular<n> , numerical hf calculations have shown that a fermi gas trapped in such a potential can behave as a metal - cluster , in the sense that the super - shells observed in the quantum spectrum are due to the interference of the shortest three - folds degenerate tori ( the triangle and square orbits ) . here<n> we study in detail we show that a perturbed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , whose hamiltonian has u(3 ) symmetry , can be parametrised in terms of the six - dimensional phase space of the projective space @xmath0p@xmath1 .<n> we find the modulation factor for the anharmonically perturbed ho , and give a strict proof of the integration measure for the perturbed ho system . <n> pacs numbers : 02.30.ik , 03.65.sq , 05.45.mt , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk [ [ section ] ] in his celebrated paper @xcite , einstein conjectured that the motion of a particle in a gravitational field can be described by a metric on a sphere of radius equal to the gravitational constant . for a spherically symmetric gravitational field ,<n> this metric is known as the riemann - hilbert metric ( rs ) @x<n> . however , it is not possible to diagonalize einstein s equations of motion in the usual way , so that the rs is not known . in this paper<n> , we give an exact solution of the einstein we present a first - order perturbation theory for rotating spherical harmonics ( ho ) .<n> the theory is exact in the limit of large ho angular momentum , and it allows us to study the non - rotating case as well . in this limit<n> the ho system can be mapped onto a perturbed hamiltonian system with the same rotational symmetry , but with a different phase function . for a given rotation rate<n> , we find that the modulation factor depends only on the angular momentum of the ho , not on its energy , in agreement with the results of numerical integration of the four - dimensional @xmath0p@xmath1 model . <n> _ introduction _ the study of rotating harmonic systems ( hhs ) has a long history @xcite , starting with the famous work of bekenstein , hawking and zeilinger on rotating rotating hamiltonians with massless dirac -

reversal ( tf ) symmetry breaking in an @xmath0-wave superconductor with an anisotropic s - wave potential .<n> we find that the anisotropy of the superconducting order parameter leads to the formation of a gap in the tf density of states at the classical turning points of the t hooft coupling . as a consequence ,<n> the superconductor undergoes a phase transition from a superconducting to a normal state . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 67.40.vs , 03.65.sq the superconducting ( sc ) order parameter in a superconductor is proportional to the phase of the order parameter of its parent phase @xcite . in the superconducting state , the sc order parameter is quantized in units of the gap function , and the superconducting transition temperature is given by the value of the critical temperature of the normal state ( ns ) . for a superconducting phase , however , there is no phase transition in the sc : the ns critical temperature is zero . on the other hand , for a normal phase transition the phase transition temperature depends on the order parameters of the system we derive a general semiclassical trace formula for the spectrum of an arbitrary potential , which is valid for arbitrary values of the angular momentum and the energy .<n> we apply it to two popular spherical potentials and show that it is in excellent agreement with the exact spectrum obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with dirichlet boundary conditions . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , we derive the semiclassical spectrum @xmath0 for an arbitrary harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential with arbitrary value of its angular momentum ( a ) , and b ) for arbitrary energy ( e ) in the limit where the amplitude of the ho potential tends to zero . for the case of a pure harmonic oscillator ,<n> the spectrum is given by the well - known formula of balian and bloch @xcite using a multi - reflection expansion of the green function . in this limit<n> , the density of states ( dos ) has a logarithmic singularity at the origin , i.e. , at the minimum of the potential . on the other hand , for a potential with a non - zero angular momentum , a singularity in the dos<n> is not present , so that we derive the semiclassical density of states for a class of one - dimensional potentials of the coulomb type .<n> these potentials are shown to exhibit the same symmetry - breaking effects as the spherical harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , i.e. , they have the same radial and angular frequencies , the same action , and the same trace formula as the ho . in particular , we find that the density of state for the ho is identically given by the trace formula of balian and bloch . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , there has been a growing interest in semiclassical methods for calculating the energy levels of various quantum systems , such as trapped ions , atomic nuclei , or quantum dots @xcite . among the various methods ,<n> one of the most widely used is the so - called trace formula , which is based on the stationary solution of the schrdinger equation with a potential of the form @xmath0 $ ] and which has been applied to the calculation of energy levels and eigenstates of various systems . here<n> we present a different semiclassical method , based on a different type of potential , namely , a potential we consider the quantum - mechanical analogue of the classical periodic orbit problem .<n> we show that the quantisation conditions for this problem can be derived from the exact trace formula for the eigenenergies of the periodic orbits . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , it has become clear that the periodic orbit ( pat ) problem in quantum mechanics can not be solved exactly . in @xcite ,<n> it has been shown that in the absence of an external magnetic field , the poincar - birkhoff - witt ( pbh ) equation can be reduced to a set of first - order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . here<n> , we present an alternative quantisation condition for the pbh problem , which does not involve the ebk eigenvalues . using this condition<n> we obtain the exact quantum - mechanically exact trace formulas for the classical and quantum periodic orbit eigenstates . as an example , this shows that it is possible to solve the classical pat problem exactly , even in the presence of a magnetic field of arbitrary strength @xmath0 , by using only the classical equations of motion , without the need for any additional assumptions about the form of the",

dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices .<n> the method is based on the application of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) to a periodic array of optical elements , such as tips , rods , and fibers . by means of this technique ,<n> we demonstrate the fabrication of a 1d array of such optical elements and study their optical properties , including transmission , reflection , linewidth and lineshape . <n> one of the most important problems in the field of optical nanofabrication is the determination of the optical lattice structure of solids , which is crucial for applications such as high - frequency filters , high - resolution spectrographs , optical modulators , as well as the realization of high - quality optical circuits @xcite . in recent years<n> , it has become possible to fabricate 1d arrays of ultra - thin metallic wires or nano - wires @xmath0 m in diameter and to measure their properties with high precision , e.g. linewidths and optical depths , with scanning tunneling microscopy ( sts ) . to fully exploit the optical properties of these devices , one needs we present a multi - wavelength study of the gravitational lensing properties of a sample of eight gravitationally lensed binaries at redshifts @xmath0 .<n> we find that the lensing magnification depends on source redshift and lensing geometry , and that the magnifications are correlated with the lens reddening in all cases , except for a few cases where the magnification is anticorrelated with the redshift of the lensed source . <n> _ introduction : _ gravitational lenses are lensing systems in which the magnification of a lensed image is known to be larger than that of its lensed counterpart . in the standard lensing theory ,<n> the lens is considered to be a single object , a lensing event , or a collection of lensing events , all of which are lensed at the same time . however , in recent years , there has been increasing interest in studying lensing in more complex situations , such as lensing by multiple objects , where the number of lensed images is unknown . for example , it has been proposed that multiple objects may be lensing each other in a binary system ; that is , two objects may have the same lens we study the dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment of the active star on the angular separation of the star from the line of sight .<n> we find that the anomalous magnetization increases with the angular distance to the line , reaching a maximum value of @xmath0 at the angular of 30 degrees for the star with a transverse magnetic field of 1 mg . for a star with an angular distance of 10 degrees ,<n> the magnetization is found to scale with the square root of the angular size , i.e. , it is linearly proportional to the number of stars present in the star . <n> anomalous magnetic moments ( ams ) of the stars are generally defined as the magnitude of the transverse component of magnetization of a star relative to the rest of the galaxy . in general , ams are very sensitive to the angular distribution of the stellar star , and in particular to its angular separation from the galactic plane . however , the ams of stars close to the galactic center ( gc ) are much smaller than those of stars at the center of the gc and are therefore less sensitive to galactic magnetic fields . the angular dependence of ams has been studied extensively , see e.g. we report the discovery of a pair of x - ray pulsars ( psr j0737 + 4849 and psrs j0748 + 4809 ) from the 3d - hst survey .<n> both pulsars are detected at high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) , and both are seen to be moving away from the center of their host galaxy with velocities near the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) limit . in addition , we detect one of the pulsars in the accompanying 3d hst image , which is also moving with a velocity near the agb limit , but is not detected in the corresponding 3d image . <n> we also report the detection of two additional pulsars from the survey , ps r j0750 + 4739 and psp r j0141 + 3729 . with the recent discovery of two new pulsars ,<n> it is now well - established that the number of known pulsars is increasing at a significant rate @xcite . among these pulsars<n> , there are two x - rays detected from the _ hst _ survey : the first is psrb , with ps we present the results of the gravitational lensing analysis of three gravitationally lensed binaries from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) legacy program .<n> we find that the fraction of binaries that form gravitationally bound systems is very high , up to @xmath0 , and that the separations of the binaries are very wide , ranging from a few hundreds of au to a few tens of au . <n> binaries with separations as small as a few au are gravitationally _ bound _ systems , i.e. , they form at the time of closest approach to the host galaxy , but once within the host , the binary system falls into the gravitational potential well of the host star , forming a short - period ( sub - au ) , rapidly spinning ( fast ) quasi - periodic ( fp ) binary . in such binaries ,<n> the mass of the secondary component is well below the hydrogen - burning limit , so that the binary s mass is directly determined from the light - travel - time ( ltt ) relation , rather than the gravitational wave ( gw ) luminosity . as a result  we show that the extragalactic black hole ( bh ) companion to the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulxr ) sgr a * , discovered by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in june 2013 , is a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with a mass of at least @xmath0 .<n> the companion is most likely an ultracompact hii region ( uchii ) as its mass is well above the hydrogen - burning limit , and is therefore a bh companion . <n> the extreme mass - ratio of the bh to its companion is due to the combination of mass and orbital motion of the system , as revealed by the rapidity difference between the two bh s , which is as large as the gap between the bh and its host galaxy , the supermassive black hole of the galaxy ngc 6240 . in the extreme case where the mass ratio is close to unity ,<n> the binary system is expected to be a roche - lobe filling ultracompact h ii region , similar to the seyfert galaxies ic 348 and sdss j0737 - 4 we report the discovery of a new ultrarelativistic binary system at @xmath0 .<n> the binary system consists of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with an orbital period of approximately 5100 s and an orbital eccentricity of approximately 0.5 . the system shows a strong blueshift of @x 0.11 , which is the highest frequency blueshift ever measured for a bsgs system . <n> binaries with orbital periods shorter than a few seconds are expected to be relativistic due to the relativistic effects of the binary s mass transfer . in such systems ,<n> the orbital angular momentum is transferred from the secondary to the primary through the gravitational potential of the secondary star . as a result , the primary star is expected to produce a bump in the orbital velocity of its companion , resulting in the formation of a bright bump on the side of the system opposite to the orbital motion of the primary . for a blue , intermediate mass binary system<n> , this bump can be as large as several hundred km s@xmath1 , making it one of the most relativistic binary systems known to date . due to its relativistic nature , binaries with short orbital periods are also expected to show a strong red in this short note , we present the timings of the subgiant branch ( sbg ) peaks of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4258 observed with the wfc3 and the vla .<n> the data were taken during the passage of the galaxy from the blue to the red wing , i.e. , from 04:40 to 06:20 and from 06:20 to 06:40 , respectively , and were recorded at a spectral resolution of @xmath0 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of fwhm=@xmath1 km / s . for comparison , the corresponding timings were obtained in the same way using the same data resolution but with the same spectral resolution , but at a lower velocity resolution . <n> although the majority of the data show a smooth rise to the blue peak , there are several cases where the rise is much more rapid than expected , such as in the case of the sg halo . in this work ,<n> we attempt to interpret the observed timings in the context of the blazar model , which is based on the hypothesis that the source responsible for the observed subgiant branches is a massive star , similar to the we present the results of a study of the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the andromeda galaxy , based on the data from the very large array ( vla ) , as well as from the atacama large millimetre / sub - millimetre array ( alma ) and the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) at the calar alto observatory .<n> we have studied the dependence of the angular size of the gmcs on the angular velocity of the parent galaxy . for gmcs with angular sizes larger than @xmath0<n> , we find that the average angular size decreases with increasing angular velocity . <n> the angular sizes of gmcs in the galaxy have been the subject of a lot of studies in recent years , both observationally and theoretically @xcite . in the case of giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) systems ,<n> the typical angular size is of the order of a few tens of nanometers , which is much smaller than the typical size of compact dwarf galaxies ( dsgs ) of the same angular size . as a result , the formation of giant gmcs is very rare , and their properties are very similar to those of",

takahashi identities for the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) generating functionals and show that they are _ a priori _ stable under the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most fascinating theoretical achievements of the last decades . in its original formulation ,<n> yang and mills @xcite introduced a supersymmetric version of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the gauge theory of qcd , with the goal of understanding the origin of superconductivity and the structure of the electroweak baryon spectrum . since then , susy has been recognized as a central theme in particle physics and has led to important advances in the understanding of the phenomenology of low - energy supersymmetry , such as the confinement and deconfinement phases of the condensed phase , as well as in the generation of baryon asymmetry in the early universe . we present a general method to derive the flow equations for an arbitrary initial state that is superrotationally invariant .<n> the method is based on the fact that the regulator s flow equations can be written in terms of a set of generalized fredholm equations ( fgmes ) , each of which is characterized by an infrared cutoff function @xmath0 . in this paper , we show that if the initial state is such that the rg flow satisfies a certain set of conditions , then the resulting flow equations are _ a priori _ unique . as a result ,<n> one can derive analytically the flow equation for any initial state , even if it is not superrotational invariance . <n> _ introduction _ the study of flow equations is one of the most important topics in statistical mechanics . for a general initial state<n> , one can easily derive a _ set of _ flow equations _ ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) that characterize the flow , which are called _ generalized rg flows_. in particular , it is well known that flow equations that are defined on the whole manifold of eigenvalues of the hamilton supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been proposed to explain the origin of fermion masses and the structure of the electroweak symmetry breaking .<n> one of the most prominent susy extensions is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , introduced by sakharov in 1987@xcite . in this theory ,<n> the gauge symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath0 , and the supersymmetry breaking scale is set by the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) at the scale . as shown in a series of papers @xcite<n> , susy naturally leads to a set of flow equations for the masses and couplings of the superparticles , which are reduced by dimensional reduction to a system of two equations of motion for the lsp at the t hooft coupling . here<n> we show that these reduced flow equations can be used to derive the supersymmetric sm - lsp relations . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of supersymmetric models is a topic of central importance in modern physics , because they have the potential to explain a wide variety of phenomena we present a nonperturbative implementation of the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow formalism for supersymmetric ( susy ) scalar field theories in dimension @xmath0 .<n> we show that the supersymmetry of the theory , and more specifically the superrotational invariance for one copy , implies the property of dimensional reduction . as a result ,<n> the exact hierarchy of erge s for the proper vertices evaluated for uniform fields ( in euclidean space ) breaks down and spontaneous susy breaking occurs along the rg flow . <n> _ _ introduction.__the rg formalism@xcite @xcite is a powerful tool in the study of field theories at low energies . in its simplest form<n> , it is a linear combination of the riemann - hilbert ( rn ) action and the action of a scalar field on the hilbert space , with the rn field playing the role of a  renormalized effective theory '' ( rtt ) , which is a generalization of the well - known ricci - t hooft action for the scalar field of the higgs model . for susy theories , we show that a spontaneously broken dimensional reduction can occur in a random field theory if the corresponding renormalization - group ( rg ) flow is _ nonlinear _ , _ i.e. , the cumulants of the renormalized field diverge at a nonanalytic scale _ during the rg flow .<n> this occurs even if the theory is superrotational invariance ( susy ) , as long as the effective average action remains @xmath0-diffusive . <n> the problem of dimensional reduction in field theory has been under intense scrutiny in recent years@xcite . in particular ,<n> dimensional reduction has been associated with the breakdown of susy and with the appearance of  supercusp''-like singularities in higher - order cumulants . as a consequence<n> , it has been suggested that dimensional reduction may occur spontaneously in random field theories , even if they are susy ( _ e.g. _ @xcite and even in the simplest case of a scalar field theory@xmath1 , where the corresponding  susy - breaking '' mechanism is the  spontaneous breaking '' of superrotationally invariant ( ssi  we present an extension of the parisi - sourlas random - field model to the case of multiple copies .<n> we show that the model admits a minimal truncation that preserves superrotational invariance ( susy breaking ) in the limit of infinite number of copies , but leads to a nonperturbative approximation scheme that is susy compatible up to second order in the field renormalization constant . in this way , we are able to provide an implementation of the grassmann - fermi - goldstone functional that allows us to check the validity of several conjectures made in the previous paper . <n> the problem of spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry is one of the central unsolved problems of statistical mechanics .@xcite in this context , spontaneous breaking is associated with the appearance of  supercusps '' , i.e. , singularities in the probability distribution of a random field , which are not present when the symmetry is broken in the ground state of the system . at the same time , the symmetry itself is explicitly broken , so that the problem is no longer a single - copy problem : instead , it is a multiple - copy one , in which susy is we study the critical behavior of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) in the large-@xmath0 limit , which is relevant to condensed - matter physics near a zero - temperature fixed point .<n> we show that the rfim is compatible with supersymmetry ( susy ) , in the sense that all higher - order cumulants of the renormalized field at zero momentum are equal to zero , and that susy is obeyed when the anomalous dimensions of the effective potential are @xmath1 . in this limit<n> , the system is described by a set of coupled flow equations for the effective average potential and the second cumulant of the field renormalization function . <n> supersymmetry is one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century .@xcite in its original formulation , supersymmetry was established as a consequence of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory of quantum field theory.@cite however , it was later shown that supersymmetry can also be obtained from landau s theory through a different mechanism , namely by the introduction of an effective field , or equivalently , through the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations we consider the quantum statistical mechanics of a particle in a uniform magnetic field .<n> we focus on the case when the field is parallel to the particle s trajectory , i.e. , @xmath0 . in this approximation<n> , we derive a closed - form expression for the probability distribution of the energy of the particle as a function of its position in the field , which is valid for arbitrary values of the magnetic field and for any value of the coupling constant . for a particle moving along the field<n> we show that the energy distribution can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution . <n> _ introduction _ the study of quantum field theory ( qft ) is one of the most active areas of modern physics , as it is the foundation of our understanding of a wide variety of phenomena , ranging from quantum information processing @xcite to the foundations of the quantum theory of gravity @x<n> . however , there is no general consensus on the definition of the qft itself , and it is not even clear whether it should be regarded as a qft at all . on the other hand ,<n> there is a general consensus that the theory of general relativity ( gr ) we present a nonperturbative approach to the dynamics of superfluid helium-3 .<n> it is based on a renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the effective average action , which is solved exactly in the limit where the superfluid mass @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse of the scale factor of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in this limit<n> , the rg equation reduces to the well - known lieb - liniger ( wt ) relation for the one - loop superfluid response , but with a dimensionless renormalized mass that depends on the bec scale . as a consequence ,<n> the wt relation is modified in a non - perturbative way , and the flow equation is reduced to a single equation that can be solved exactly for arbitrary superfluid density , field strength , initial conditions and for arbitrary initial conditions in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) domains . <n> the study of the dynamical properties of ultrarelativistic helium-3 has been one of the major goals of condensed matter physics since the pioneering work of lieb , lindblad and dirac.@xcite supersymmetry ( susy ) and weyl fermions ( wt ) are the most important symmetry - breaking mechanisms in condensed - matter physics .<n> they are often associated with the breakdown of dimensional - reduction at large scales , which is a necessary condition for the emergence of susy and wt at all scales . in this paper , we show that dimensional reduction can also be achieved in susy without wt through the superfield formalism , provided the initial conditions are chosen in such a way that the resulting susy -

free , i we prove that every component of the hurwitz divisor of a standard g.d.c . <n> cover @xmath0 , @xcite , is a component of an equivariant map of the unit disk .<n> this result is a consequence of a new proof of the fact that the jacobian of the inverse image of the image of a map , whose inverse is a map from the unit disc to the real line , can be written as the product of two inverses , one from the inverse of the map and the other from the map . in this paper<n> , we prove the following result . * the _ inverse _ image of an inverse is defined as the inverse , in the inverse sense , of the corresponding inverse image in the unit field . for a map<n> : * let _ denote the inverse inverse of its image _ , _<n> i.e. _ the map from its unit field to the inverse field of the same cover . +<n> * let @x _ be the  inverse '' image of @x<n> . then , the map is isomorphic to the map @x,@xmath1 let @xmath0 be a normal , g.d.c .<n> , and a nonsingular variety . we show that the restriction of the branch data @xcite to @x , where the restriction is a commutative diagram , is a normal ( g.e. , reflexive , divisorial ) cover . <n> we also show that if the branch divisors are weil , then the morphism is also normal . in this paper<n> we are interested in morphisms which are not flat , but which are reflexive and have a flat fundamental relation . for a smooth , non - normal variety<n> we say that a _ morphism _ is _ not _ a morphism of a branch data . here<n> we deal only with the case where there is a biregular involution on the branch , induced by the degree 2 map . a  morphism '' is a map from a variety to itself , a generalization of the well - known notion of an _<n> a priori _ known quantity , which is the difference between the number of branches of a variety and the total number of we give a construction of the cover @xmath0 of the complex projective plane from the invariants of the double locus .<n> the construction proceeds in two steps : first , by gluing together some  nice '' subvarieties of the real line , and second , from the appropriate data for the double loci . as an application<n> , we show that every invariant of the range of the dual variety of the plane is obtained from this construction . <n> [ thm : glue ] in @xcite , it was shown that every genus-@xmath1 variety has a finitely generated , self - adjoint variety invariant . in this paper<n> we will show that the same is true for every variety in the complex plane , namely , that every cover of the projective space from the plane comes from the constructions described above . we prove that the variety @xmath0 is a subvariety of the variety of codimension 1 , i.e. it is isomorphic to @xcite .<n> more precisely , we show that the fiber product diagram of the corresponding ring map induces an exact sequence on the set of all varieties of degree 1 whose pushforwards are the coordinates of a certain subvariety . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that there is an isomorphism between codimension 2 and 1 . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction the aim of this paper is to give a new construction of the schur algebra associated to the cohomology group of a compactification of the complex projective plane , which we call the _ projective fiber product _ , or pfp for short . in this paper<n> we deal with the problem of finding a variety of degree 2 that is a projective fibre product of the two - dimensional complexifications of the three - dimensional projective planes , and we call this _<n> complex fiber product_. we will assume that the projective space is a compactified version of the space of complex numbers , called the we prove that the ramification locus of a g.d.c . <n> @xmath0-cover is always pure codimension 1 , except in a few special cases .<n> in particular , we show that the g. d.c<n> . covers obtained by gluing along a smooth rational curve always have pure codimensional cohomology 2 , even though they are obtained by standard means , i.e. , by gluing to a smooth projective surface . in the case<n> where the smooth component of the rational curve is the only branch point , our result gives a new proof of the well - known fact that the branch points of smooth rational curves are the only ramification loci of g.i.d . @xcite g. s. baumgardt , m. a. ahlfors , and t. adams @x , in their seminal work on the geometry of projective surfaces , introduced the notion of _ depth _ , which is a notion of codimension 2 for smooth rational surfaces . as a consequence of their work ,<n> many authors have studied depth in the context of projectivity , e.g.  let @xmath0 be a smooth double locus of codimension one .<n> we prove that the action of the tale on the double locus is isomorphic to that on the triple locus . as a corollary<n> , we obtain that every finitely generated , smooth , finitely presented cover of the double loci is isomorphism from the triple to the double . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of algebraic varieties over a finite field has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli , jacobi , and thurston ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for varieties defined over a field ,<n> the _ morphism group _ is the set of all possible involutions on the field . in the case<n> that the field is a compact field ( i.e. it has no singularities ) the group has a well - known _ group action _<n> ( see e.g. refs . and references therein ) and the action can be expressed in terms of the group action itself . on the other hand , for varieties<n> that are not compact , there is an _ action we prove that the double loci of @xmath0 are hurwitz divisors . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of double loci in varieties has a long history .<n> shokurov , @xcite , showed that if two varieties are normal , then they have a divisor , in characteristic zero , which is a crossing divisor of the first variety . in characteristic<n> one such divisor is called the _ double locus _ , and it is well known that it can be determined from the double locus itself . however , this is not the only way to determine whether two varieties have a double loci ; it is also possible to determine the divisor that determines them , up to isomorphism , if one of the varieties is _<n> semi - log canonical_. in this note , we study the semi log canonical morphisms between two equidimensional varieties . we show that , under certain conditions , the morphism can be written as follows : [ lem : adjunction ] let @x,@xmath1 , be a finite morphism of degree between equidimensional slc and equidimensional @ we introduce the notion of a hurwitz divisor for a @xmath0-cover .<n> this divisor is defined on the _ double locus _ of a cover , i.e. it does not contain any components of the double locus of the underlying base . <n> we show that if a double cover is abelian , then it is isomorphic to a _ standard _ cover . as an application<n> , we prove that a cover is _ symmetric _ iff it has a slc divisor , which is a generalization of the well - known fact that a standard , symmetric cover is symmetric . in this paper<n> we study the structure of _<n> double covers _ ( also known as _ covers with _ ramification order _ or _ gorenstein _ divisors ) . for a general , standard @ x , let @xcite be the set of all standard covers of x such that the base is a , , double cover of x and the ramification orders of the corresponding covers are g.d.c . ( see definition [ lem : structure ] ) and @x let @xmath0 be a g.d.c . <n> ( smooth ) universal cover .<n> we study the asymptotic behavior of the cartier index of the kernel acting on the locus of the preimage of the maximal ideal of @xcite . in particular , we show that if the kernel is sufficiently smooth , there exists an exact sequence in which each term splits under the action and each character splits into two exact sequences , one for each character of the universal cover<n> . we also treat the case of a pair , and show that there is a sequence of involutions that commute with the action , as well as a pair of exact sequences that are not factorizable . the notion of universal cover was introduced by john von neumann in his work on the dynamics of gorenstein manifolds . since then<n> , universal covers have been used in a variety of contexts , ranging from the study of dynamical systems with periodic boundary conditions to the stability of riemannian manifolds with compact boundary . for instance , it was shown by smyth , neukirchhoff and others that the set of eigenvalues of the linearized dirac operator on a compact rie let @xmath0 be the maximal totally ramified cover of a smooth abelian group @xcite .<n> we prove that if the cartier index at a point of @x s boundary is equal to one , then the map is cohen - macaulay . <n> [ section ] [ thm]proposition [ rdm]corollary this paper is concerned with the problem of finding the maximal hurwitz divisor of a riemannian group , in the case where the boundary data is given by a smooth map . here<n> we consider the following problem : given two smooth maps , define the pullback of a character of the map to be the pull - back of a preimage of a line bundle on which the map acts via a primitive character ; then define the kernel of the action of the kernel on the preimage ; suppose that the line bundle at the point of the pullback consists of two copies of the same line bundle , one of which is the image of the other , and suppose that there is a point on the boundary of the group such that each copy of the first map acts on the second map via the same character . under the assumption that let @xmath0 be a g.d.c .<n> , @xxmath1-cover . in this paper<n> we consider the index - non - normal case : we study the maximal totally ramified cover of @xcite , which is obtained by gluing a cover of the set @x<n> frac12$ ] of points such that the locus of the branch data of the standard cover is contained in the preimage of the double locus of @ x , and we show that the maximal  non - ramified '' cover is always maximal . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ section ] [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ]corollary [ theorem][ theorem]lemma [ theorem],remark this paper is devoted to the study of the index and the cartier index of a family of double covers , that is , covers of the real line such that there is a branch of degree at least two and the number of edges is at most two . for a family @x ,<n> let : [ tb ] denote the set of points in the plane such that : ( i ) the locus in @x we prove that the double locus of @xmath0 has an index that is normal everywhere except possibly on one component . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ] proposition [ theorem],conjecture the index map @xcite is one of the most important geometric structures in non - commutative algebra .<n> it has been studied by many authors , including gauss , neumann , and others . in this paper<n> , we consider an index map from the real line to the imaginary line , which is a generalization of the well - known index map , but whose action on the line is also non - normal . we show that this index map can be embedded into a double locus in a riemannian manifold such that the inverse of this double locus has index zero everywhere except maybe on the two components . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of a theorem of bernoulli and wagner , as well as a new result about the character of the inertia subgroup of the affine lie group . [ lem]proposition [ prop]example [ prop ] introduction [ prop in this paper we give a complete characterization of the @xmath0-covers of surfaces .<n> in particular , we prove that the covers are gorenstein , they are regular with building data given by smooth irreducible components of the double curve of the cover , and they are dense in the sense that they do not contain any edge . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the concept of a  surface '' was introduced by thurston in his lectures on  the geometry of surfaces '' at the i.i.t.s .- <n> institut de mathmatiques , universit de montral , c. p. 6128 centre ville , montral h3c3j7 , qubec , canada ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . a _<n> surface _ is a smooth compactly supported bundle over a riemannian manifold , hence it is called _ a surface_. the study of such objects has a long history , starting with the famous works of hurwitz , sturm - liouville and bess , on the  we study the cohomology of the @xmath0-invariant sheaves of the inertia subgroup of the gorenstein - hilbert action on the three - dimensional euclidean space .<n> these sheaves are the subspaces of the riemann surface associated to the two branch lines and the first inertia cone of the action , respectively . <n> we show that the comorphism group of the sheaves is isomorphic to the cone over a cycle of rational curves . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of a result of smyth and wagner @xcite , which asserts that the inertia isomorphism group is the cofinite group for the action of the weierstrass group on the 3-manifold of revolution . in this paper<n> we are interested in sheaves that arise as the divisors of an action by the generator of its inertia subgroup ( see below for an exposition of the main results ) . we are particularly interested in the case where the inertia group is either the inertia or the hilbert group of a lie group ( see refs . [ thm : hilbert ] and [ sec : action ] for details  we consider a graph @xmath0 , which is obtained by gluing two copies of a smooth rational curve along the right hand side of a line .<n> the graph is called inertia and it is generated by the inertia subgroups of the lie algebra of real numbers , i.e. , by the integers . in this paper , we show that the set of relevant points can be described intrinsically as a set of points of the graph over which the inertia subgroup of the real numbers is zero but not d.c . <n> [ ex1 ] this paper is a continuation of the paper [ ex2 ] , where we have introduced a new graph , namely , a graph with a cokernel concentrated on a given set of singularities , and we have studied its properties . here<n> we have extended the results of [ ex3 ] and [ ex4 ] to the inertia case . we have also studied the properties of the cokernel , in particular we have proved that it can be concentrated on the singularity set of the inertia group of a surface . the main result of the present paper is that , under some assumptions , the graph obtained from the inertia graph is isomorphic to the we study the singularities of the sheaves @xmath0 induced by the covers of the rationals on the two -

dimensional torus .<n> this is done by finding all subvarieties of the hurwitz divisors in the defining equations for the surface . in the normal case<n> we find all such singularities , while in the non - normal case we find only those classified by kollr and shepherd - barron in @xcite . <n> the object of our study is the set of all _ odd _ even _ singularities over the open set of tori . here<n> we are mainly interested in the _ normal _ case , since this is the one in which we expect to find a large number of new examples , as well as to recover many known ones . for the proof<n> we use the lemma [ prop : interesting - case ] , which states that the surface @x<n> s is slc if and only if it is isomorphic to the boundary of a compact subset of a torus with boundary equal to its own . the proof is based on the fact that if we fix a point on the torus and write down the equation @x we prove that the minimal semiresolution of the hamiltonian @xmath0 on a bounded subset of the complex projective plane is a nonsingular double curve . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a sequel to @xcite .<n> the first part of the paper is devoted to proving that , for a non - singular double curve on a compact set in the complex plane , the _ minimal _ semiresolution is a _<n> simple _ , _ smooth _ double curve if and only if the branch locus of the cover is supported on a d.c . divisor . in the second part<n> , we use this result to prove that if , in addition , there is a point of type s@xmath1 in the boundary of the unit disc such that the branch loci of the normal divisors on the boundary and on the exceptional curve of the blow up are of the same type , then there exists a nontrivial , minimal semismooth , double curve which is not a complete intersection . we compute the minimal semiresolution of a blow up of a curve in the complex plane . <n> let @xmath0 be a complete intersection .<n> then there is a natural restricted cover @xxmath1 , which is defined by pulling back the normal derivative at the point of the complete intersection and normalizing along the exceptional curve . in this paper<n> , we study the blow ups of curves in the plane and compute the semiresolutions of the corresponding restricted covers . the case of a point @xcite was the first , and still is the case today , for which we have a large collection of examples of restricted covers of the plane , with a variety of interesting properties . for example , there is an infinite collection of covers that are complete intersections , so there are a large class of examples , even more than the collection of complete intersections of the real line , where there are many interesting examples . as a corollary ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known fact that the minimal resolution of a restricted cover is equal to its inverse image , that is , the inverse of its strict transform . here<n> we present a new result for the case where the point @ let @xmath0 be the double curve of the complex projective line group @xcite .<n> we study the singularities of the minimal semiresolution @x<n> slc , which is the minimal resolution of the set of all semiresolutions of the projective plane , and the minimal half -

gluon plasma ( qgp ) is studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in the lbt model , each parton - medium scattering contributes to the transverse momentum ( perpendicular to the initial direction of the propagating parton ) of the final leading partons according to matrix elements of the single -

reaction in the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> the parton is allowed to transport further according to the transport equation and to undergo additional scatterings in the subsequent time intervals . using the small - angle approximation of @xmath0 scattering , we estimate the averaged transverse momentum squared per unit length and the elastic energy lost during the propagation of an initial parton in a static and uniform qgp at different temperatures . from the numerical calculations<n> , it is found that the transverse- and longitudinal - momentum broadenings of the energetic part we study the evolution of the leading parton s transverse momentum distribution in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium .<n> we show that the evolution is strongly influenced by the initial parton energy and that the energy dependence of the elastic energy loss can be understood in terms of the transverse momentum broadening of the medium partons . <n> jet quenching is one of the most important phenomena in high energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the early stage of a collision ,<n> the energy of the parton traversing the collision zone is small , and its transverse momentum is almost independent of its energy . at later times , however , as the energy increases , the partons transverse momentum broadens due to elastic scatterings with the thermal partons of the qgp medium , also known as the  jet transport '' . the jet transport parameter @xmath0 , which characterizes the jet broadening , is a measure of the jet energy loss . for a heavy parton with a small energy , its jet transport is independent of the energy and its initial transverse momentum , while for a quark with an energy larger than the energy loss it depends on its multiple scattering of partons in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium can be described by a light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in this model , partons<n> are assumed to propagate with a reduced energy due to energy and momentum conservation along their path in the medium .<n> the energy loss of the leading parton is assumed to be logarithmically proportional to the energy of the initial parton in the qgp medium , while that of the negative \" parton has a power law dependence on the medium temperature . as a result of this logarithmic energy dependence , the parton s average energy loss per unit distance during multiple scattering is reduced , leading to an overall reduction of the averaged parton energy loss over a long distance . at the same time , thermal recoil partons , minus those of negative \" type , continue to lose energy and approach a thermal spectrum at later times . <n> partons with different energies and in different hadron - hadron ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) scattering channels can have different average parton energies in a uniform medium at a constant temperature , but they will have different energy loss in a qgp the propagation of partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is simulated within the longitudinal boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model .<n> the energy and momentum lost by the propagating parton will act like a source for jet - induced medium excitation through the propagation and transport of the jet - inducing medium partons . in this article<n> , we describe the lbt model in a uniform qgp medium and present the results of parton spectra and jet reconstruction in @xmath0au collisions at 62 gev/@xmath1 . <n> partons are allowed to propagate and interact with a thermal medium according to the parton transport equation . to study jet propagation and jet - medium interaction at the same time , both of the outgoing partons and the leading parton propagating in the qgp are tracked and tracked in monte carlo simulations . the energy loss of the initial parton from the thermal medium is also taken into account in the transport equation to account for the back - reaction effect . as a result ,<n> parton energy spectra and parton reconstruction are obtained in the presence of a uniform medium with a constant equation of state ( eos ) of the medium  jet - induced medium parton distributions in high - energy heavy - ion collisions are studied within the linear - response theory ( lbt ) model .<n> the leading parton does not propagate along a fixed direction but receives transverse momentum transfers in random directions and accumulates transverse momentum broadening along its propagation path due to the interaction with the medium partons . as a result ,<n> the final parton spectra are different from those given by other linear response theories , hydrodynamic simulations or anti - de sitter / conformal field theory correspondence studies . <n> the study of parton - parton interactions in hot and dense qcd matter is one of the most important tasks of the present and future high energy collider experiments at bnl s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern s large hadron colliders ( lhc ) . in these collisions<n> , one expects to probe the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the collision of heavy nuclei at high energy density and high temperature . at rhic energies , the energy density of qgp is expected to be of the order of @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 @xcite  we study the effect of parton hadronization on the energy loss of a fast parton as it propagates through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium . using a monte carlo jet reconstruction algorithm that includes both leading parton and jet - induced medium partons ,<n> we show that the final hadronic jet energy loss increases linearly with time and distance of propagation .<n> we also find that the angular distribution of thermal recoil partons is modified at later times due to the diffusion of negative \" partons and transverse momentum broadening of the propagating parton . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collisions produce a highly collimated system of quarks and gluons that propagate through a hot and dense qgp medium of hadrons and anti - quarks . due to multiple scatterings of the hard partons with the qgp matter , partons lose energy and momentum , which leads to the formation of jets @xcite . during the course of the parton propagation , however , one should also take into account the energy losses of the initial parton due to scatterings with other partons in the medium , such as leading partons as well as negative partons @x leading partons propagating through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium lose a significant amount of energy during their propagation through the medium .<n> we study the evolution of leading parton and medium parton induced jets produced in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and find that the effective jet energy loss increases linearly with the inverse of the initial energy of the energetic parton , @xmath0 , and the logarithm of the transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . at the rhic energy ,<n> the jet - induced medium partons are also found to diffuse away parton - medium interaction , leading to a reduction of the jet energy and a net transverse momentum of reconstructed jets . <n> the propagation of energetic partons through a hot and dense qgp medium is expected to result in the formation of strongly interacting quarks and gluons @xcite . in particular , a jet produced in a high - energy collision of two hadrons , such as the one produced in the central collisions of au+au collisions at rhic ( or the one created in the forward collisions of ni+ni at the cern sps ) we present a monte carlo study of parton propagation and jet transport in a qgp medium with the complete set of elastic @xmath0 scattering processes .<n> we calculated the evolution of the parton distribution function , parton energy loss , and the transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of the leading parton as it propagates through the medium . <n> the study of jet transport is an important tool to understand the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a strongly - interacting phase of matter , created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in qgps ,<n> partons interact with the hot and dense medium through elastic scatterings which are described by the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model of qcd , which has been well - tested in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments , as well as in the hadron - hadron scattering experiments at the rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) collider and the tevatron ( proton - proton collisions at collider energies close to the lhc energy scale ) where it is important to test the predictions of the cgc model . we study the suppression of leading partons and reconstructed jets in heavy - ion collisions in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . using a modified version of the jet finding package with the anti - @xmath0 algorithm in which the energy of negative \" partons from the back - reaction is subtracted , we show the effect of transport of jet - induced medium partons on reconstructed jets .<n> it is shown that the transverse momentum broadening , parton distributions ( fragmentation functions ) and transverse profiles of reconstructed jets are influenced by the transport of these jet - inducing medium parton . <n> suppression of partons in high - energy nuclear collisions is one of the most important and challenging problems in nuclear physics today . in particular ,<n> the jet suppression is believed to be a sensitive probe of the properties of the dense qcd medium created in high energy nuclear reactions @xcite . at the same time , however , the microscopic nature of the qgp medium is not well understood . for a realistic description of jet suppression , it will have to implement inelastic processes such as gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton - medium scattering , which should be implemented in the lbt we present the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev measured by the star collaboration at rhic .<n> the spectra are calculated in the framework of the parton cascade model using the monte carlo event generator pythia with realistic event - by - event glauber dynamics . <n> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the collision of heavy ions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic)@xcite is an ideal environment for studying the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions . in particular , the qgp is expected to undergo a phase transition to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , known as the qcd phase transition ( qpt ) , which is characterized by a high degree of thermalization and , consequently , a high entropy production rate ( he ) @xcite . at high rhic energies ,<n> the he s are expected to be produced more abundantly than the pions , due to a higher initial temperature and density of the hot and dense qgp matter , as well as a larger volume of the collision region , compared we study the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 ratio in pb - pb collisions at the lhc energies .<n> we find that the rapidity distribution of the nucleon has a different shape in central and mid - central collisions compared to that in p - p collisions , due to the different rapidity distributions of pions and kaons in the two - pion system . <n> the rapidities of nucleons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) are sensitive to the properties of the hot and dense medium created in these collisions . in particular , the nuclear modification factor ( mf ) , which is defined as the ratio of transverse momenta of nucleon to pion in central collisions @xcite , is a sensitive probe of the medium - induced modifications of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and of the initial conditions of the collision . at rhic energies ,<n> the mf is expected to have a broad maximum around 10 gev / c and a sharp minimum around 5 gev/@xmath1 . on the other hand , at the cern sps energies and for a wide range of center -

angle approximation , which turns out to be identical to that of the gaussian approximation for the single - plate case . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to compute the scattering amplitudes for the scattering of light on metallic plates with arbitrary numbers of parallel and antiparallel scattering angles , as well as for arbitrary angles of scattering . in the past few years<n> there has been considerable interest in the theoretical and experimental study of light scattering from metallic plates @xcite . from the experimental point of view , it is well - known that light scatters from a metallic plate at a nonzero angle with respect to the plane of the plate , and that this scattering we study the electromagnetic response of a double quantum dot coupled to two metallic leads .<n> the dot is assumed to be weakly coupled to the leads , and the current -

abelian statistics of elementary excitations ( see , e.g. , refs . [ eqs : e&g ] ) , as well we study the interference of electromagnetic radiation emitted by two parallel plates separated by a finite distance .<n> it is shown that the maximum in the spectral distribution of the radiation is shifted by zero wavelength shift when the distance between the plates equals an integer number of coherence lengths , independently of shapes of the distribution functions . in the case when the wavelength shift is zero , the maximum is shifted again by a factor proportional to @xmath0 . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of interference effects in optical waveguides has a long history , going back to the work of bennett and brassard in the 19th century @xcite . since then , it has become an active area of research , with applications ranging from optics to condensed matter physics , and with a wide range of theoretical and experimental interests . for a review , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein . here<n> , we will concentrate on the problem of interference of radiation emitted from two planar waveguides , separated by an integer distance , in the regime when the two waveguides are well separated from each other , but the wavelength difference between them is of the order of the wavelength we derive a green s function expansion for the quadrupole radiation spectrum of a spherically symmetric fluid in the limit of low viscosity .<n> the resulting expression is equivalent to that of @xcite , but it is better suited for an analytic study of the behavior of the radiation spectrum . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of radiation properties in fluids has a long history , going back to the work of nernst , sturmfels , and rosen ( ner ) . in their seminal paper ,<n> ner showed that the spectrum of radiation emitted by a fluid at low viscosity ( @xmath0 ) is given by a sum of two terms : the first is proportional to the square of the viscosity and the second is a function of the angle between the fluid flow and the light front . for a fluid confined to a spherical shell<n> , ner suggested that the two terms are related by a correspondence rule , which states that they are proportional to each other up to second order in the viscosity of the fluid . on the other hand , in recent years , there has been considerable interest in the application of the ner correspondence rule ( rnr we calculate the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a single metallic plate of arbitrary thickness and composition , in the frequency range @xmath0 .<n> we show that the visibility of the low - frequency part of the spectrum is given by a simple formula , which can be evaluated in closed form , for arbitrary scattering angles , and for arbitrary plate thicknesses . for comparison<n> , we also evaluate the visibility in the blankenbecler - drell and molire approximations . <n> _ introduction. _ electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a variety of ways , including , but not limited to , laser , synchrotron , x - ray , uv , visible , optical , microwave , radio and terahertz frequencies . in all these cases ,<n> the emitted radiation is usually referred to as  electromagnetic radiation . ''<n> the spectral shape of the radiation is determined by the scattering properties of the intervening medium , e.g. , electrons in solids , photons in semiconductors , phonons in metals , nuclei , or atoms , to name a few @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , the problem of characterizing the electromagnetic spectrum we present a theory of the radiation spectrum in the vicinity of strongly scattering foils , in the limit of small @xmath0 .<n> it is based on a generalization of the blankenbecler - drell theory , which is valid in the region of large radiation intensity , but which neglects the interference between dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole radiation . as an example<n> , we apply the theory to the case of a single plate of aggregate thickness . <n> pacs numbers : 41.60.ap , 41.75.ht , 42.65.sf , 78.67.-n electromagnetic radiation is one of the most intense fields in nature , and plays an important role in many fields , ranging from cosmology to physics . in particular , it is responsible for the radiation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and of the anisotropy of the spectrum of radio waves in the earth s atmosphere @xcite , as well as for the x - ray emission of the sun and other pulsars and radiation from the sun - earth interaction region @x<n> . however , the study of radiation from objects of finite size is not trivial . we study the effect of fluctuations of scattering on the interference fringes of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a pair of two - dimensional ( 2d ) foils .<n> we show that the interference effect is strongly suppressed in the large-@xmath0 region , where fluctuations tend to suppress the radiation . in this region<n> , the interference function has a maximum at @xmath1 , which is achieved by the molire distribution . <n> the interference of photons emitted by two 2d foils is one of the most studied problems in quantum optics @xcite , and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years ( see , _<n> e.g. _ , refs.@xcite and references therein ) . at present , there are two main approaches to the problem : ( i ) exact solutions of the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) equations , or ( ii ) semi - classical approximations , based on the landau - ginzburg - wilson (  lgw ) theory . for the latter approach ,<n> the most used is the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , in which the photo we derive an exact expression for the interference function in the case of double small - angle scattering of electrons from two identical metallic foils separated by a distance @xmath0 .<n> we show that this function has a maximum at a finite thickness of the second target , and that its amplitude does not depend on the number of foils . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of electron - electron scattering in a double scattering potential has been considered for a long time @xcite . in the original formulation ,<n> the potential was written in terms of the scattering strengths of the two parts of the system , which were assumed to be small compared to each other , in order to make the problem tractable . as a result , the problem was reduced to the evaluation of an interference function between the two scattering potentials , for which a simple analytical expression was obtained . since then<n> , a large amount of work has been done on the problem , both theoretically and experimentally , using various approximations and approximations of different types . among them<n> is baier - katkov s formula for the maximum in the interference of two electron beams , due to the fact that it takes into account the in this paper , we present a theoretical study of two - target bremsstrahlung in gold foils , with the aim to clarify the role of nearest scatterings in the visibility of radiation minima and maxima .<n> it is shown that the visibility depends on the scattering strength in a non - trivial way , and that this dependence can be described by an exponential function @xmath0 of the interatomic distance . <n> it has been known for a long time that radiation from a single scatterer in a medium with a finite density of free particles ( e.g. , a gas ) can exhibit oscillations of the intensity as a function of the distance between the scatterers @xcite . in particular , the so - called lpm effect , in which the radiation spectrum exhibits a uniform suppression at small distances , was first observed experimentally in the 1960s . since then , lpm - like oscillations have been observed in a number of experiments , including high - resolution x - ray scattering experiments in ultra - cold atomic gases ( see , for example , refs.@xcite and references therein ) , as well as in laser - induced fluorescence experiments ( see refs we study the lpm - like and anti - lpm effects on bremsstrahlung in random and weakly scattering media .<n> we find that the former effect is accompanied by an enhancement , which can be called the anti - laplace - migdal ( lpm ) effect . for macroscopic and fixed separation ,<n> lpm enhancement at low @xmath0 corresponds to a suppression of the interference term in the spectrum of radiation emitted parallel to one of the scattering plates , as if it were enhanced by a lpm wave function . at large separation <n> , this effect can be associated with an inclined - half - wavelength resonance , but not with the unit wavelength resonance as in the case of classical electrodynamics . in recent years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the experimental observation of lpm effect @xcite , i.e. , enhancement of radiation intensity due to multiple scattering in a random or weakly scattering medium , and to the theoretical explanation of this effect , in particular in the context of migdal s multiple scattering model , where it has been shown to be related to an enhancement of photon - assisted processes in atomic matter . to date , the it is shown that the anti - longitudinal phase - shift ( anti - lpm ) effect may be observed in the radiation emitted by a charged particle moving through a medium with a transversely uniform density .<n> the possibility of observing the effect is illustrated by considering a simple model of a plate , where the transverse motion of the projectile is described by the relativistic mean - field theory ( rmft ) . in this model ,<n> the particle is assumed to move with the velocity @xmath0 , and the distance between its center and the observer s line - of - sight @xcite , i.e. , the transverse dimensionless speed of sound is assumed small compared with the projectile s rest mass velocity . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the possibility to observe the effect of anti - linear phase - shifts ( alps ) in radiation emitted from charged particles moving through media with uniform density ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a recent review )<n> . it may be added that the alps may be also observed in non - uniform media , such as , for instance , nuclear matter ( nmm ) and atomic nuclei .",

pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) approach .<n> we show that the lpm approach is able to describe the main features of the physics of the quark system . in this approach ,<n> the interaction between quarks and gluons is given by the sum of two terms , the first one being the noninteracting one , while the second one corresponds to the self - energy . for the angular averaged interaction parameters , we use the legendre polynomial expansions of the effective interaction , and find that these parameters are color- and spin - independent . as a consequence , for each flavor , each of the chemical potential and the average effective mass can be obtained from the interaction parameters in the same way as in the balanced case . <n> the physics behind the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the most important open problems in nuclear and particle physics . from the theoretical point of view<n> , it is well - known that the qgp is a strongly interacting system , which can not be described by the perturbative qcd equations  we calculate the temperature dependence of the large-@xmath0 thermodynamic potential in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .<n> we find that the rpa results are consistent with the phenominological landau theory , which predicts a temperature independent quasiparticle pole at @xmath1 mev , independent of the quark mass . at low temperatures ,<n> the pole is shifted to lower values of the temperature , and the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the thermodynamic potential is consistent with perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and lattice qcd ( lqcd ) predictions . <n> _ introduction _ in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the thermodynamics of strongly - interacting matter at finite temperature @xcite . in particular , the question of the existence of a low - temperature phase transition in qcd has been the subject of intense debate @x<n> . one of the possible phases is the deconfined quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) phase , in which the quarks form an equilibrated plasma with a temperature much lower than the critical temperature of the qcd vacuum . to study this phase transition we study the low - temperature behavior of the gluon propagator and the plasmon modes in a system of two degenerate quark flavors in thermal equilibrium .<n> we find that at low temperatures the gluonic vacuum is dominated by the vacuum polarization tensor , while the longitudinal plasmonic mode has a nonzero imaginary part due to particle - hole creation processes . in the zero - temperature limit ,<n> the dispersion relations of the modes are the same as in the balanced case . <n> the study of the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite is one of the most important topics in qcd , because the qgp is expected to be a dense and strongly interacting phase of matter , which can be discovered experimentally at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . at the same time<n> , qcd suffers from a number of theoretical problems , such as unphysical quark masses , unphysical infrared divergences , and the non - perturbative problem of quark confinement . as a result , much effort has been devoted to understanding the behavior of qgp at finite temperature @xmath0 , where @ we study the thermodynamic properties of an ideal bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature @xmath0 and zero baryon density .<n> we show that the ideal - gas part of the thermodynamic potential density is proportional to the square of the temperature and to the logarithm of the baryon number density , with a coefficient that depends on the chemical potential of the condensate and the temperature . in the limit of zero temperature ,<n> we recover the results of the ideal gas approximation , which is valid for arbitrary temperature and chemical potential . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.mh , 05.70.ce , 11.10.wx , 12.40.nn the study of the thermal properties of atomic and molecular gases is of fundamental importance in nuclear and particle physics , as well as in condensed - matter physics . for an ideal gas , the temperature of the gas<n> is given by the gibbs - bogoliubov theorem , while for a quark - gluon plasma it is related to the relativistic mean - field approximation ( rpa ) of the quark self - energy @xcite . as a consequence , in the rpa approximation<n> , there is no contribution to the thermodynamic we calculate the longitudinal and the longitudinal - transverse contributions to the energy of static quark - antiquark pairs in an imbalanced system .<n> we find that the longitudinal contribution dominates at small temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and small momenta , while the transverse contribution is dominant at small @xcite . in the low - temperature limit ,<n> the longitudinal part is proportional to the chemical potential of the quarks , with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the densities of the two quark flavors . at high densities , however , the longitudinal gluon is screened , so that the effective mass of the system is independent of the particle number density . <n> the problem of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most important unsolved problems in theoretical physics . due to the lack of analytic solutions for the long - wavelength modes in qcd<n> , it has been suggested that the interaction between quarks and gluons should be mediated by a non - local interaction , such as a potential , or a coupling to gluons , which is approximated by a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . since the rpa we study the effect of gluon self - interaction corrections on the qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat in the large-@xmath0 limit .<n> we find that the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat signals a breakdown of fermi - liquid theory at zero - temperature and directly influences the properties of quark matter in the core of neutron stars . for a two - flavor imbalanced quark system , the effective mass obtained from the rpa calculation depends on the chemical potentials of both flavors , which is a consequence of the static screening of the electric gluons at long wavelength . <n> [ [ section ] ] the thermodynamics of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a topic of great current interest @xcite . in the qgp<n> , there is a strong correlation between the temperature and the quark effective mass , @xmath1 . at low temperatures ,<n> the temperature dependence of the quarks effective mass is strongly dependent on the temperature , due to the long - range nature of the gluon interaction . as a result , at zero temperature : ( i ) the effective masses of both quark flavors are independent of each other  we study the spin structure of an interacting quark - antiquark system in the limit of an infinite number of colors @xmath0 , i.e. , the massless limit .<n> we find that the spin - spin correlation function is proportional to the square of the spin correlation length , which is in agreement with recent lattice simulations . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.38.bx , 12.39.jh , 11.15.bt , 11.10.wx the study of spin effects in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein , hawking and israel @xcite . in their seminal work<n> it was shown that a system of noninteracting quarks and gluons in thermal equilibrium can be described by the schrdinger equation , where the quark and gluon fields interact through a lorentz - invariant effective interaction . since then<n> , many theoretical and experimental studies have been performed to understand the properties of qcd matter under various conditions , such as in the case of massless fermions , in the presence of a magnetic field , or in the minkowski quantum field theory is turned into a euclidean statistical field theory ( sft ) suitable for studying the dynamical properties of a many - particle system .<n> it is shown how to make the hamiltonian and the effective action of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) into a s ft , and how to use the latter to study the dynamical behavior of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . as an example<n> , we calculate the effective potential of qcd and the energy density of the qgp in the perturbative qcd approach . in this approach<n> the potential between the quarks and the gluons is assumed to be proportional to the gluon propagator , @xmath0 , which is a function of the energy densities of quarks , gluons , as well as of the transverse momenta of quark and gluon fields in the plasma . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 11.15.tk , 11.10.lm , 12.40.nn statistical mechanics is a powerful tool to investigate the properties of many - body systems , especially in the presence of interactions between the degrees of freedom of the system the euclidean version of the partition function of a quantum field theory at nonzero temperature is calculated .<n> the result is interpreted in terms of matsubara summations . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 11.10.lm , 05.30.-d the partition functions of quantum field theories at zero temperature are usually written in euclidian form @xcite . however , at finite temperature , in the presence of boundary conditions , it is often convenient to write them in a more physical form , such as in a statistical field theory ( sft ) . in the case of qft<n> the boundary conditions are symmetric and anti - symmetric with respect to the system s momentum , as in the standard formulation of the hamiltonian in which the symmetries of the theory are taken into account . as a result ,<n> the eu clidean partition function is given as a contour integral over the momentum space @xmath0 , where the temperature is defined as the inverse of the temperature . here<n> , we will show that it is possible to define a euclidien version of all tensors appearing in qft , namely all we present a derivation of the rpa corrections to the thermodynamic potential and to fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequencies in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .<n> the derivation is based on a set of contour integrals , which can be expanded in terms of the real and imaginary parts . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.90.+b , 14.80.bn in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics the higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . in its minimal extension ( mssm ) ,<n> it contains only fermions , bosons and their corresponding composites , known as supersymmetric particles ( ssps ) @xcite . for a description of the sm particles one has to take into account the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , in which case the susy particle content has to be encoded in the superpartners of the particles . however , this supersymmetry breaking can not be implemented in the sm without introducing fermion fields , called quarks , into the theory . the most well - known fermi - higgs coupling is @xmath we present a systematic study of the effect of quark - gluon imbalance on the properties of the qcd vacuum .<n> in particular , we show that the presence of an imbalance in the masses of the quarks and gluons , as well as in the quark and gluon condensates , leads to an enhancement of the gluon polarization . as a result ,<n> the vacuum is expected to be unstable against the formation of a deconfined phase , in which the gluons and quarks are separated by a distance @xmath0 times the fermi radius . <n> recently , it has been proposed @xcite that in the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , due to gluon degrees of freedom , there may exist a non - vanishing gluon density in the medium . in this case<n> , the polarization of the medium may be strongly reduced compared to that of the vacuum , leading to the so - called qcd gluon plasma ( qgp)@xcite , which is characterized by a high density of gluons ( quarks ) and a low density of anti - quarks ( antiquarks ) at the center of the system  the renormalized gluon self - energy is calculated for the case of massless quarks in the high - density limit ( @xmath0 ) .<n> it is shown that in the zero - temperature limit the gluon matter part is equal to the infinite vacuum contribution , which is due to the dressed gluons . as a consequence ,<n> the non - relativistic quark - antiquark scattering amplitude is proportional to the squared momentum transfer squared . <n> it has been known for a long time that the low - energy effective theory ( lte ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high energy densities is dominated by gluon degrees of freedom , i.e. , by the so - called dressed gluon ( cg ) effect @xcite . in the lte approximation<n> the cg effect is described by the equation of state ( eos ) for a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in which the quarks are treated as massless , while the gluons are dressed by a color gauge theory ( gauge theory ) ( see , for example , refs . and references therein )<n> . however , it is not we study the effect of the presence of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) in the framework of the non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) .<n> we find that the eos is modified due to the condensate and that this leads to an increase of the effective number of particles with respect to the bare quark - antiquark pair . as a result ,<n> the nuclear eos becomes stiffer and the suppression of the anomalous magnetic moment of the neutron becomes more pronounced . <n> the study of the nuclear properties of matter has a long history , being one of the main topics in nuclear physics @xcite . in the early days of the theory of quantum mechanics<n> , the bec was proposed as a possible explanation for the origin of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) and heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments . during the last decade , hic experiments have been used to measure the properties of the dense matter created in relativistic rhic and hic collisions , such as density , temperature , chemical potential , and in this letter we show that in the limit @xmath0 the gluon propagator becomes proportional to the energy scale .<n> this is due to the fact that in this limit the low - energy processes around the fermi surface , namely particle - hole processes , are screened , while the electric gluon is dynamically screened . <n> [ [ section ] ] in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the coupling constant between quarks and gluons is given by the sum of two terms : the standard quark - gluon coupling constant (  coupling constant '' ) and the mass of the quark . in the case of qcd @xcite , it is well - known that the masses of the fermions and the gluons are proportional to each other , with the latter being massless in the vacuum . as a consequence ,<n> it is expected that the vacuum is a pure gluonic state . on the other hand , in qcd , there are many different possibilities for the massless gluon state , such as a pure quark gluon gas ( qgp ) , a pure diquark gas ( dqg the quark self - energy is derived in the coulomb and lorentz gauge to lowest order .<n> it is shown that the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) contribution to the energy density is suppressed by the ghost degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,<n> the gaussian approximation is no longer valid . in this letter<n> we will show that in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field , the vacuum energy density @xmath0 of a quark acquires a logarithmic singularity at the fermi surface , where the field is described by the bec @xcite . at the same time , in the absence of electromagnetic fields , this singularity is replaced by a singularity in the momentum distribution of the quarks , i.e. the so - called stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) law . <n> the sb law states that the total energy density of a particle is proportional to the square of the particle s mass , and is independent of its charge . on the other hand , if the particle is heavier than a certain mass scale , then its energy density depends on its mass . for a particle with mass close to the scale of the electromagnetic field the self - energies of a quark and an antiquark in the quark gluon plasma are calculated in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we find that the single - quark self - energy is @xmath0 , where the first error is statistical and the second is due to the uncertainty in the helicity of the quarks in the plasma . for the antiquarks ,<n> the first - order self -energy is found to be very small , of the order of a few mev , while the second - order one is about twice as small as the first order one . in recent years<n> there has been a growing interest in the study of the properties of the hot and dense medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) due to its potential importance in understanding the mechanism of nucleosynthesis . <n> one of the most important issues in this field is the question of the existence of a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons in the qcd medium @xcite . to answer this question<n> it is necessary to calculate the contribution of the glu",

centrosymmetric dark matter ( dm ) candidates in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) off the @xmath0 resonance .<n> we find no evidence for dm in the dis data , but we are able to place upper limits on the mass of dm candidates , which range from a few hundred to a few thousand solar masses , depending on the dis scenario . <n> our results are consistent with a scenario in which dm is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , with a mass comparable to or even larger than the wimp mass , and whose properties are similar to those of the neutralino , the dark matter candidate recently reported by the dama collaboration @xcite .",

<n> the answer is that the motion of a random penny which at a meeting of its owner agent is given to the other agent at half speed is as the associated markov chain at the same transition rate . <n> [ theorem]corollary @xcite <n> . there is a short version of the result in the  gossip algorithms '' literature .<n> here i give a compressed version of it . we consider continuous - time averaging models for social dynamics models .<n> the models we study are based on the voter model @xcite , and include the following : ( i ) the averaging process @xmath0 started from an arbitrary configuration of agents ; ( ii ) an associated markov chain ( mc ) ; and ( iii ) a time-@xmath1 averaging process . <n> [ sec : adual ] for the averaging model , we introduce the concept of _ duality _ as measuring the  local smoothness '' of a function relative to the local structure of the particular meeting process , analogous to the notion of local smoothness in classical averaging processes . for coalescing chains ,<n> we show that the spectral gap of the associated mc is strictly positive . as a consequence , from an initial configuration with average zero , the time- and space-@ x configuration of the averaged process @ x is asymptotically _ smooth _ , _<n> i.e. _ the process converges exponentially fast to a stationary distribution . [ p : duality ] in the case of reversible chains ( rts )<n> , @x we present a markov chain model of opinion - changing processes . in this model<n> agents interact via a local interaction mediated by a markovian dynamics .<n> the model is exactly solvable and provides an example of a non - equilibrium , non - linear dynamical system . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + - + + _ _ + + the subject of opinion dynamics has seen dramatic progress in the last few years @xcite . despite this progress , many open problems remain , including understanding the mechanisms by which information is exchanged between agents , how this exchange is affected by the presence of noise in the system , and how the dynamics of the system is influenced by the nature of the interactions between the agents . to address these issues ,<n> there has been a lot of work done on opinion dynamics , both in the theory itself as well as in the application to control and simulation of systems . a popular approach to opinion dynamics is to consider it as a model of dynamical systems , in which agents interact with each other via some kind of markov process ( see , e.g. , the introduction of the term  dynamical '' in the definition of the theory  we consider the opinion dynamics of a finite - agent model of opinion formation , where opinions are generated by agents interacting with their neighbors . in this model<n> , each agent can create up to @xmath0 different opinions , and each opinion can be  absorbed '' in an ordered configuration of agents .<n> we study the dynamics of this model , both analytically and numerically . <n> in particular , we prove that the consensus time ( the time it takes for all the opinions to be in one of the ordered configurations ) is polynomial in the size of the system . we also show that this consensus time can be expressed as a linear function of the number of opinions . as a consequence ,<n> we derive polynomial - time upper and lower bounds for the consensus times in the general case . we propose a new stochastic model of the discrete logarithm of the number of agents in a multi - agent system .<n> the model is based on the concept of the _ tokenization process _ : initially each agent has a collection ( cluster ) of tokens . at time @xmath0 each agent gives his tokens to the other agents . <n> tokenization is a stochastic process in which agents interact by exchanging their tokens with the help of a distributed random number generator . in the case of multi - agents systems ,<n> this number generator is a random variable , which can be expressed in the form of a markov chain , a gaussian , or a poisson process , depending on the characteristics of the token distribution . as an example<n> , we consider the case where agents interact with each other only through the exchange of their tokens , i.e. , the so - called _ discrete logarithm _ ( d@xmath1 ) . for this model<n> we derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of the total number of tokens exchanged between two agents , for arbitrary initial conditions , and show that the distribution depends on the underlying dynamics of the system only through in the finite voter model @xcite , each voter interacts with @xmath0 neighbors in a square lattice , and each member of each lattice particle interacts with the other neighbors in the same lattice .<n> the dynamics of the model is described by a set of independent markov chains , which are allowed to move at half - speed , move independently until two particles meet and thereby coalesce . in this paper , i study the behavior of the coalescence time as a function of the rate of change of the associated markov chain , as well as of the number of neighbors of a given particle . <n> i first show that for a symmetric rate of increase of the markov rate , there is a critical value of the coupling constant @x , such that the coalescing chains process converges to the voter model as the coupling is increased . for a rate of decrease ,<n> there is no such critical value ; instead , the coalescent time scales as the square root of the increase in the rate . as a consequence , for a fixed rate of reduction of the rates of change , one can define a finite - time measure on the set of all particles , called the _<n> we provide bounds on the average hitting time and the average absorption time of a markov process on the @xmath0-dimensional voter model .<n> these results apply to a wide range of voter models , ranging from simple rw to more complex voter models with multiple opinions . <n> markov processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , computer science , and biology . in particular , they play an important role in dna recombination , quorum sensing , gene regulation , protein folding , dna replication , as well as in the dynamics of bacterial motility @xcite . as a result of these processes<n> , there has been much recent interest in the time it takes a process to move from one state to another , or to change from a state to the next , on a stochastic process . for example , it has been shown that the time to change a state in a dna - recombination model can be bounded by a function of that state s recombination rate , provided the recombination rate is sufficiently small . on the other hand ,<n> it is not known how fast a process can move on a weighted graph , nor how fast it can change in time on the complete graph  we prove that the mean meeting time of @xmath0 independent identically distributed (  fmie '' ) walkers on the two - dimensional torus is asymptotically larger than the mean time for the corresponding standard random walk on the torus to meet . <n> the result applies to the finite voter model @xcite , and also to a variety of special geometries .<n> the proof is elementary , in the sense that it does not rely on theorem [ t_oliveira ] , which would have given the same bound for all regular graphs . as a corollary of the result ,<n> we show that the number of fmie walkers meeting in the same place at the same time is bounded above by the number ( in units of the diameter ) of neighbors at which the meeting time has been reached in the previous interval ; this number depends on the geometry , but is of order unity for regular graphs and of order one for infinite - dimensional lattices . in a series of recent papers , we have studied fmie models on various finite geometries , including the toroidal lattice , the cylinder , a cone on the half - line , as well as the fano plane @x we show that the @xmath0 epidemic model has a local weak limit geometry .<n> the limit geometry is a galton - watson tree with a size - biased offspring distribution after the first generation . <n> * keywords : * transience , epidemics , tree , voter model , poisson process . _ we introduce a stochastic variant of the stochastic landau - zener game in which each agent has a finite amount of money . whenever two agents meet , they instantly play a fair game in in which one agent acquires the combined money , and vice versa .<n> we call this process the  disordered limit '' of the game . in the limit ,<n> the set of agents with non - zero money forms an  independent set '' ( no two are adjacent in the weighted graph ) ;

the latter because we preferentially select systems that , owing to galaxy orbital motion , are momentarily in a more compact state ( transient compact configurations ) . hickson s ( 1956 ) catalog of compact groups of galaxies ( hcg ) was the first catalog to provide criteria for identifying compact groups .<n> however , the catalog contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . <n> in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes were used . in order to correct for these effects , sulentic & rabaa ( 1997 )<n> have applied a friends - of - friends algorithm to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey ( barton et al 1996 ) and has compiled a catalog of 89 redshift - selected compact groups ( rscgs ) found by means of this algorithm . here<n> , i review the properties of the hcg catalog and its evolution from its initial publication to its present form , as well as the status of efforts to improve the catalog s completeness and identify groups by automated techniques ( prandoni et al 1994 , de carvalho & djorgovski 1995 ;

type galaxies in compact groups , but is much more pronounced for radio galaxies than for spiral galaxies , suggesting that the radio emission is from an agn rather than a starburst . we review the progress made in our understanding of the physical properties of the gas in compact groups of galaxies , and discuss the implications of the recent detection of diffuse x - ray emission in these systems . the nature of compact groups of galaxies has been a matter of debate for many years . in this paper<n> , we discuss the most recent results on this subject . <n> @scaling.95 # 1@scaling#1 @scaling # 1 = @scaling compact groups of galaxies are often characterized by a high fraction of diffuse x - ray emission , a high frequency of morphological features indicative of interaction and/or merging , and a low fraction of physically related galaxies .<n> the physical properties of these discordant galaxies are consistent with a scenario in which they are part of a loose group , or a filament seen end -

ray properties of a sample of 40 shakhbazian groups selected from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) .<n> the groups were selected on the basis of their red colors and the presence of compact groups . <n> we find that the average space density of galaxies in compact groups is @xmath0 times higher than that of the general population of galaxies , and that compact groups are typically small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . i review the current observational evidence for the presence of merger remnants in compact groups of galaxies , and discuss the prospects for detecting merger signatures in large samples of such objects . <n> psfig.sty = 2em = 15.5 cm = 22.6 cm = -1.0 cm = 0.5 cm @xmath0 harvard -

induced star formation . <n> we also consider the possibility that some of these compact groups may form agn through gravitational amplification of background field galaxies , as suggested by duc & mirabel ( 1995 ) and hunsberger et al ( 1996 ) . if this is the case , one would expect to find compact groups at high redshift containing agn , starburst galaxies and compact groups containing elliptical galaxies . at the other end of the scale , dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies ; for example , they form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris . we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end result of compact - group evolution . on the other hand , i review the observational evidence for the evolution of compact groups of galaxies , and their role in the formation and evolution of galaxies both past and present . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we study the effect of anisotropy of the primordial density perturbations on the angular power spectrum of gravitational lensing .<n> we show that the lensing power spectrum can be significantly affected by the anisotropic primordial density fluctuations . in the framework of the standard cosmological model ,<n> the primordial perturbations are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic , and to have a power - law spectrum with index @xmath0 @xcite . however , observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have shown that the clustering of matter is quite different from the primordial one : the spectrum of the matter power spectrum is much steeper than that of the dark matter ( dm ) power spectrum . as a result<n> , the primordial power spectrum has been found to be very different from that of dm in the sense that it can be well fitted by a single power law , while it has been poorly fitted by the dm power spectrum in the past . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the analysis of the sni ia observations . among the different possible candidates for the origin of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe  we present a new method of galaxy cluster abundance estimation , based on the cumulative distribution of galaxy number density within a cluster .<n> the method is applied to a sample of @xmath0 bright , nearby , compact groups of galaxies , selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . <n> our method is based on two simple assumptions : ( i ) the cluster abundance is a constant within the cluster , and ( ii ) there is a continuous distribution of cluster members among the galaxies in the group . using this method<n> , we find that the average cluster abundance , within the virial radius , is a function of the cluster mass , with a power - law index of -1 , in good agreement with the results of the galaxy cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> we show that , for a given galaxy luminosity , there is always a cluster member with a cluster mass larger than the mean cluster mass within that luminosity range , regardless of the mass of the host galaxy . in other words , _<n> if a galaxy is in a group , it is more likely to have we report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at redshift @xmath0 .<n> the cluster , sdss j1148 + 1425 , has a total galaxy mass of m@xmath1 , which makes it one of the most massive clusters known . at the cluster<n> redshift it has a mean velocity dispersion of 294 km / s , and a cluster -

''<n> the concept of an  alignment '' of a sequence with respect to this set of vertices was introduced by anderson in his work on _ sequences in trees_. it is a we introduce the concept of a _ spanning forest _ , which is a natural generalisation of the well - known _ tree _ in phylogenetics .<n> a spanning forest of a pedigree is an undirected graph with @xmath0 vertices , where each vertex is associated with a unique spanning forest in the pedigree . in this paper , we investigate the identifiability of undirected spanning forests for pedigrees , and prove that they can not be distinguished from tree - like spanning forests . <n> * keywords : * tree , spanning forest + * ams subject classification :* 05c75 + we study the recombination - mutation - recombination ( rm ) model of recombination in diploid genomes .<n> we focus on questions related to the identifiability of recombination and mutation . in particular , we are interested in the following types of questions : ( i ) can we determine the size of a diploid genome from the distribution of alignments on its set of vertices ?<n> ( ii ) is it possible to determine the rm model ? and ( iii ) what are the probability parameters defining the recombination and rm processes , such as the size , depth , discrete population , etc . <n> we study these questions under two simple models of recombinations and mutations , _<n> i.e. _ , under the assumption that sequences evolve on a pedigree under a recombinations without mutations ( _ model rm_ ) , and under the hypothesis that sequences evolving on the pedigree undergo a recombination and a mutation , as in , e.g. , model m. in the case of a directed @xmath0-forest , the sequences are first assigned to the founder vertices of the pedigree and then evolve on it in a top - down manner , we propose a new model of bipartite recombinations in a bistable state of a cell .<n> the cell undergoes two cell divisions to create four haploid gametes , each receiving one of the four chromosomes . at each division , a strand from the first pair and one from the second pair<n> are chosen randomly with equal probability , since the lack of chromatid interference is guaranteed by the bistable nature of the process . in the limit of a large number of chromatids ,<n> the four gametes merge into a single chiasma , and the cell becomes bistable . <n> recombinations play an important role in the evolution of a variety of organisms , including bacteria , viruses , sperm cells , _<n> e.g. _ , bacteriophages @xcite , superconductors @xmath0 $ ] ( superfluids ) , nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) complexes @x<n> _ etc_. in some systems , such as bacteriophage bistability , recombinations also play a crucial role ; for example , the _ chiasmata complex _ in the cell , where the cell divides into four we propose a new model of evolution that is reversible .<n> it consists of a process in which the state space is partitioned into directed and undirected regions , and each region is randomly assigned a state different from all other states in the region , independent of the states in other regions . in the absence of mutations ,<n> the directed regions evolve according to the character distribution on the leaves of a directed @xmath0-forest , which is the same distribution as that on the site patterns of the undirected trees . as a result<n> , the evolution of a sequence of sequences evolving on a tree can be examined by looking at the character distributions on the sites of the tree . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of evolution is one of the fundamental problems of modern science . despite its importance , however , it is not obvious from the point of view of evolutionary biology whether the process of evolution can be considered as reversible , i.e. , whether it is a continuous or a reversible process . on the other hand , _<n> reversible _ processes , such as the one described here , are known to be reversible in the sense that they do not depend on the initial conditions we consider the problem of identifying hidden markov models ( hmms ) .<n> we define the notion of an hmm to be a sequence of hidden states @xmath0 , and consider models r and rm on a family of pedigrees , which are sequences of vertices of degree at least 2 . <n> we show that if the probability distribution on the set of observed states is known , then the hmm is identifiable if and only if it is a hmm . in other words ,<n> if there are no observed states other than those contained in the pedigree , the model is not identifiable . to this end<n> , we introduce a new notion of identifiability , defined as the probability that there are at least two distinct subsets of known states in the family , each of which has a well - defined hidden state . as an example of the utility of this new notion , in this paper we prove that the family of diploid pedigrees of depth 2 is identifiable under model r , even though the probability of transition between the two subsets is not known . we also show that , under mild conditions on the model parameters , diploid , haploid , we present a new approach to the phylogenetic classification of trees .<n> it is based on the observation that trees can be distinguished not only by their structure , but also by their character frequencies . in particular , we show that under model r and model rm , the character frequencies are sufficient to distinguish most diploid pedigrees of depth 2 . as an application ,<n> we compute the marginal joint distribution on the number of trees of each type . <n> the study of trees is one of the oldest and best studied branches of phylogenetics . for a general description of trees<n> , there is a notion of structure @xmath0 , defined as the set of all possible arrangements of the characters of a given sequence of trees @xcite . a tree s structure can be characterized by its depth , or by its number of branches , and by the type of tree it belongs to : type a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , k , j , o , p , r , s , u , x , y , z and zr ; and by its type , we present a new method for reconstructing diploid pedigrees of arbitrary depth @xmath0 from their crossover probabilities .<n> the new method is based on the following observation : ( i ) there are only 4 ways in which any two extant vertices have a common grandparent ; ( ii ) the subpedigrees of all pairs of extant vertices in a pedigree are indistinguishable under model r. <n> * keywords : * diploid genealogy , crossover probability , continuum reconstruction * ams subject classification :* 92d30 , 05c50 , 15a18 . [ [ section ] ] reconstruction of diploid ancestry is one of the most important and challenging problems in modern genetics @xcite . in particular , it is important to understand the connection between diploid lineages and their descendants , the so - called diploid trees , which have been shown to be a powerful tool in the study of ancestral inheritance . the first step in the reconstruction process<n> is to determine if there are any diploid ancestors present in the ancestral lineage , and , if so , to identify the most probable descendants of the present ancestors . for a large class of ancestral lineages ,<n> we show that the probability that two sequences of characters have evolved on the same ancestral tree is greater than that for any other sequence of characters .<n> this is a consequence of the fact that the distribution of length of runs of sites at which all three characters are in the same state is more likely on a haploid pedigree than on a diploid pedigree , a family of trees in which no two vertices have exactly one common parent . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of evolution is one of the central problems of modern science . in order to understand the diversity of life on the earth ,<n> it is important to identify sequences that have evolved differently from each other @xcite . for example , it is well known that the evolution of a population on a tree is determined by the number of its descendants @xmath0 , and that the diversity and distribution of the descendants can be used to determine the evolutionary path of the population . on the other hand<n> , there is also a natural question to ask : what are the distributions of characters on the ancestral trees ?<n> the answer to this question depends on the type of tree in which the characters are embedded , i.e. , whether they are we consider maximum likelihood reconstruction of undirected phylogenetic @xmath0-forests , which we define as follows : _ given an undirected @xcite-forest , we associate with each site @x<n> s of the open ball of radius s@xmath1 a random sequence of characters , such that the sequence s _ fractional site pattern frequency _ , @x , is a function of the length of the random sequence .<n> we show that maximum likelihood is statistically consistent for the reconstructions of phylogenetic trees of the above type if and only if the following conditions are satisfied : ( 1 ) the following set of conditions are met : * * the following are sufficient for identifiability . * <n> ( 2 ) * the maximum likelihood error in the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree is bounded below by a positive real number . <n> * _ the following is a necessary and sufficient condition for statistical consistency of maximum likelihood methods for undirected tree reconstruction . for any phylogenetic tree ,<n> the following statement is a sufficient condition : [ thm -

eps - l1 ] concentration inequalities are important in many areas of physics . in statistical mechanics , for example , concentration inequalities @xcite are used to give bounds on the average distances between pairs of particles in a given ensemble , or on the mean distances between particles in the same ensemble . here , we are interested in the distribution of the size of a set of particles , i.e. , the _ average distance _ between two points on a lattice . for a particle in a lattice<n> , this average distance is the mean distance between the points on the lattice divided by the total number of lattice points , and it is called the average distance in quantum mechanics . we will assume that the lattice size is a power function of the distance between two particles . if the two particles are i.i.d . random variables ,<n> then we will see that we consider a hidden markov model ( hmm ) defined by two sequences @xmath0 of random variables each of which is a markov chain ( mc ) with transition matrix @xcite .<n> we show that if the initial distribution of the hmm is concentrated near the stationary distribution of a mc , then the length of the alignment of the two sequences is bounded by a constant independent of the size of the model . <n> markov chains ( mcs ) play an important role in many areas of science and engineering , such as molecular biology , chemistry , physics , and nuclear physics . in these areas ,<n> it is important to understand the relationship between the properties of the mcs and those of the models they represent , in order to understand how mcs may be useful in certain applications . for many models , the transition matrix is the only input , while for others , it is necessary to define the mc and the model itself , which is known as a markovian model ( mnm ) . as a result , there are many markovian models and many markov transformations that can be defined , for example , on the space of all possible mcs we show that a hidden markov model ( hmm ) with spanning forests of length @xmath0 on which the probability distribution on observed states is the same as that on hidden states is identifiable up to re - labelling of hidden states .<n> the class of models equivalent to this hmm is defined by the spanning forests and transition probabilities . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of evolution is one of the cornerstones of modern statistical physics . in recent years<n> , much progress has been made in the characterisation of evolution , in particular in the so - called identifiability problem @xcite , where the probability distributions on observed and hidden states are related via a markov process . here<n> we present a further step in the process of characterisation , which is based on the identification of a class of markov models that are equivalent to a particular class of hmms , called _ pedigrees _ in analogy with the characterization of permutation matrices @x<n> eq -

[<n> [ intro - introduction]]the concept of a pedigree is introduced in the theory of stochastic processes , and it has recently been used to characterise stochastic processes evolving on a sequence of we consider the random walk @xmath0 on the set of spanning forests of the pedigree , which is a discrete time markov chain with site - dependent transition probabilities .<n> we show that the corresponding random walk on the vertex set is , up to a relabelling of vertices , identical to the walk on a cube with the same vertex set , but with distinct labels for consecutive vertices . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / * * + + _ this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite , where we introduced the family of hidden markov chains ( hmms ) , and studied their properties . in the original paper ,<n> the hmm was defined as follows : a markov process which generates a sequence of _ hidden states _ with probabilities given by the transition probabilities of an automaton . here<n> , we study the properties of the corresponding _ pedigree _ , defined as the number of paths on the automaton with vertices labelled by undirected _<n> spanning forests_. we define the pedigree as the set _ of rows _ and columns of an hmm , with each row and column labelled by an undirected in this paper , we present a new approach to the problem of recombinations in trees .<n> we consider a tree @xmath0 with site - specific spanning forests @xcite , and we assume that recombinations occur only at sites in the tree ( model rm ) . we show that the probability of an alignment between consecutive spanning forests is given by the product of probabilities of the alignments on the space of alignments under rm and the probability that the first spanning forest is an arc of the tree . <n> we then define a new invariant , which we call the _ recombination index _ ( ri ) of a tree , defined as the ratio of the number of recombination events between two consecutive alignments . in the case of trees with spanning forests ,<n> we show how ri can be computed from the probability distribution of the ri of a single alignment . as an application<n> , ri is used to derive a new upper bound on the size of a subfamily of trees in a polyhedral lattice , known as a pedigree , with a fixed number of arcs . *<n> introduction : * recombinations are ubiquitous in nature , appearing in a variety of we show that if @xmath0 is a non - negative integer , then there exists a probability distribution on the set of all reals that is equal to the distribution given by the log - normal distribution of @xcite . <n> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg , , we derive a new lower bound on the number of @xmath0-residues needed to construct a spanning forest with a given pedigree .<n> we also show that it is possible to construct spanning forest sequences with a fixed pedigree that have a smaller number of recombinations than the known lower bound . <n> [ [ section ] ] it has been known for some time now that there is a family @xcite of tree - like sequences , called spanning forests , that can be used to encode information about the evolutionary paths of a population of organisms . in particular , it is well - known that if a population is initially split into two subpopulations , one of which is ancestral and the other is not , and each subpopulation is allowed to evolve through the forest , then the information contained in the ancestral distribution is sufficient to encode the evolutionary path of the individuals in the subpopulation . on the other hand ,<n> it is not clear how to construct another subpopulation of the same population , which is also not ancestral and has the same evolutionary paths . to construct such a subpopulation<n> , we would need to find a family of sequences that can encode the ancestral information correctly . for a population we show that spanning forest sequences of length @xmath0 are uncorrelated to each other if and only if the number of recombinations between adjacent subsequences is at least as large as the total number of such sequences .<n> we also show that this is a lower bound on the minimum value of the spanning forest bound . <n> the problem of finding the minimum spanning forest sequence ( mfns ) for a given sequence @xcite has been of interest since the early days of spanning forest theory ( sft ) . in its original form ,<n> the mfn problem was formulated as a convex optimization problem on the set of all possible spanning forests of the same length , with the objective of maximizing the probability of finding a given mfn . since the formulation of the mnf problem , the np - hardness of the problem has been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally . however , until very recently , no upper bound was known for the minimum number of recombining sequences that can occur in a spanning forest in a given spanning forest , let alone an upper bound for the minimal value of this number . here , we present such a bound , which is valid for any spanning we show that the probability distribution on the space of alignments under model renormalization group ( rm ) can be decomposed into a product of two parts .<n> the first part is a linear function of the number of lineages , and the second part is an additive function that depends only on lineages of the first kind . in other words , if lineages are the same under model rm then they have the same number of undirected ( therefore , undirected ) forests . as an application<n> , we obtain a new proof of the fact that the distribution of the size of the largest connected component of the evolutionary tree of type @xmath0 has a log - normal distribution . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of trees has been one of the main topics in evolutionary biology since the time of @xcite . since then , trees have been used to study a wide range of topics , including the structure of the universe , the origin of life , evolution of non -

dimensional euclidean distribution when the crossover probability is sufficiently small . <n> the one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) tree models @xcite have been extensively studied in combinatorics , number theory , graph theory and statistical physics . in particular , they have been used to study the asymptotic behavior of the log -

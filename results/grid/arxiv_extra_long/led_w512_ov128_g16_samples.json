armed grand design spiral structure was likely to be within the bright optical disk .     the likelihood that the corotation resonance is within the optical disk can be assessed by comparing the measured ratio of outer to inner spiral extent with the value of the canonical ratio ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ) .    the test using the canonical ratio is not conclusive because of variations due to rotation curve shape .    it is also possible that there is no inner lindblad resonance . to counter our ignorance of the rotation curve ,    a test with a more conservative value of the ratio should the location of inner rings at the inner 4:1 resonance also limits spiral extent , but the location of outer rings at the outer lindblad resonance places no extra constraint on spiral extent . � this research was supported in part by the director s research fund at the space telescope science institute . � i thank otto richter for an electronic copy of his table of @xmath53 observations and riccardo giovanelli for electronic copies of several tables summarizing @xmath67 observations . � i have benefited from conversations with ken freeman , piet van der kruit , and alar toomre . � arne henden kindly observed and provided processed ccd frames of six of the galaxies for this project . � thanks to the referee , bruce elmegreen , for his comments and criticisms that led to improvements of this paper . � i have benefited from conversations with ken freeman , piet van der kruit , piet van der kruit , and alar toomre . � arne henden kindly observed and provided processed ccd frames of six of the galaxies for this project . � thanks to the referee , bruce elmegreen , for his comments and . a. , & thurstans , r. p. 1989a Â , , 338 , 78 bertin , g. , lin , c. c. , lowe , s. a. , & thurstans , r. p. 1989b Â , , 338 , 104 bicay , m. d. , & giovanelli , r. 1986a , , 91 , 705 bicay , m. d. , & giovanelli , r. 1986b , , 91 , 732 bicay , m. d. , & giovanelli , r. 1986b , , 91 , 732 bicay , m. d. , & giovanelli , r. 1987 , , 93 , 1326 binney , j. , & tremaine , s. 1987 , galactic dynamics ( princeton : princeton university press ) de blok , w. j. g. , mcgaugh , s. s. , & van der hulst , j. m. 1996 , , 283 , 18 buta , r. 1986 , , 61 , 609 buta , r. , & crocker , d. a. 1991 , , 102 , 17 , g. 1980 , , 81 , 198 dalcanton , j. j. , spergel , d. n. , & summers , f. j. 1997 , , 482 , 659 elmegreen , b. g. 1996 , in _ barred galaxies _ , ed . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen ( asp conf . ser . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen ( asp conf . ser . ____ , r. buta , d. a. crocker , & b. g. elmegreen , b. g. 1990 , , 355 , 52 elmegreen , b. g. , elmegreen , d. m. , & montenegro , l. 1992 , , 79 , 37 elmegreen , b. g. , elmegreen , d.m . , & seiden , p. e. 1989 , , 343 , 602 elmegreen , d. m. , & elmegreen , b. g. 1987 , , 314 , 3 elmegreen , d. m. , & elme s. t. , & roth , j. 1986 , , 92 , 250 gordon , d. , & gottesman , s. t. 1981 , , 86 , 161 haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1984 , , 89 , 758 haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1986 , , 306 , 466 haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1991 , , 102 , 841 haynes , m. p. , giovanelli , r. , starosta , b. m. , & magri , c. 1988 , , 95 , 607 hewitt , j. n. , haynes , m. p. , & giovanelli , r. 1983 , , 88 , 272 hickson , p. , kindl , e. , & auman , j. r. 1989 , , 70 , 687 huchtmeier , w. k. , & richter , o .- g . blad , p. o. , & athanassoula , e. 1996 ,  , 313 , 65 nilson , p. 1973  , 313 , 65 nilson , p. 1973  , 313 , 65 uppsala , uppsala general catalogue of galaxies ( uppsala : uppsala offset center ab ) pickering , t. e. , impey , c. d. , van gorkom , j. h. , & bothun , g. d. 1997 , , 114 , 1858 press , w. h. , flannery , b. p. , teukolsky , s. a. , & vetterling , w. t. 1988 , numerical recipes ( cambridge : cambridge university press ) roberts , w. w. 1969 , , 158 , 123 roelfsema , p. r. , & allen , r. j. 1985 , , 146 , 213 romanishin , w. h. , & bedke , j. 1988 , , 204 , 909 sandage , a. , & bedke , j. 1988 , atlas of galaxies useful for measuring the cosmological distance scale ( nasa sp-496 ) ( washing . 1993 , , 409 , 110 sellwood , j. a. , & kahn , f. d. 1991 , , 250 , 278 sellwood , j. a. , & sparke , l. s. 1988 , , 231 , 25p sempere , m. j. , garcia -

      "reference": "a driven system of three species of particle diffusing on a ring is studied in detail . the dynamics is _ local _ and conserves the three densities . a simple argument suggesting that the model should phase separate and break the translational symmetry is given . we show that for the special case where the three densities are equal the model obeys detailed balance and the steady - state distribution is governed by a hamiltonian with asymmetric long - range interactions . this provides an explicit demonstration of a simple mechanism for breaking of ergodicity in one dimension . the steady state of finite - size systems is studied using a generalized matrix product ansatz . the coarsening process leading to phase separation is studied numerically and in a mean - field model . the system exhibits slow dynamics due to trapping in metastable states whose number is exponentially large in the system size . the typical domain size is shown to grow logarithmically in time . generalizations to a larger number of species are discussed .",

range interactions do not exhibit phenomena such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and phase separation ( except in the limit of zero temperature or in the context of long - range interactions ) @xcite .    in contrast , some examples of noisy @xmath0 dds with local dynamics have been found to exhibit such phenomena .    one example of a noisy system which exhibits ssb in @xmath0 is the asymmetric exclusion model open boundaries .    other examples of models in which there is ssb in @xmath0 have also been found in the context of cellular automata @xcite and surface growth @xcite . in the latter ,    ssb was due to the fact that one of the rates for a local dynamical move in the models is zero .   ssb is due to the fact that once this zero rate changes to a non - zero rate ssb disappears .    ssb is due to the fact that one of the rates for a local dynamical move in the models is zero .   ssb is due to the fact that once this zero rate changes to a non - zero rate ssb disappears .    in a recent letter   ssb is a closely related problem to spontaneous symmetry breaking , is that of _ phase separation _ in @xmath0 noisy systems . this has been observed in driven diffusive models with inhomogeneities , such as defect sites @xcite or particles @xcite . in these models   ssb is due to the fact that it has been found that macroscopic regions of high densities are formed near the defect , much like a high density of cars behind a in a recent letter � @xcite we introduced a simple three - species driven diffusive model exhibiting phase separation and spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry on a ring . in the model nearest - neighbor particles exchange with given rates and the numbers of each species are conserved under the dynamics . � the rates of all local dynamical moves that obey the conservation laws are non zero . � an argument indicating that generically the system phase separates , thus breaking the translational invariance , was given for the case when none of the species of particle has zero density . � in the special case of equal number of particles of each type , it was shown that the local dynamics obeys detailed balance with respect to a long - range asymmetric ( chiral ) hamiltonian . in this special case , � using the hamiltonian , we have found the steady state of the model exactly and have been able to prove the existence of phase separation analytically . � the existence of a hamiltonian for this special case is of interest in the light of speculation that non - equilibrium systems exhibiting generic long - range correlations might be described by effective hamiltonians containing long - range interactions @xcite . � here we explicitly demonstrate that for the special symmetric diffusion of the particles , the effective temperature is infinite and phase separation is lost .    in the present work we note that a related but distinct three - species model has recently been introduced by arndt _ of particles of different species it is of interest to investigate the steady - state behavior in finite - size systems . � we have found it convenient to do this by employing a matrix product technique previously used to solve the steady state of asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite . � however , in the case of three species the simplest form of this technique @xcite is applicable only to a limited class of systems @xcite . for the present model � we generalize the matrix product to a product of rank 6 tensors and write the steady state by taking an appropriate contraction . the partition sum and steady - state correlation functions � the paper is organized as follows : � the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species of particles has zero density . in section iii � we study the special case where the model satisfies detailed balance and explicitly write down the steady - state weight for the three - species model . � the paper is organized as follows : in section iv we define the model introduced in @xcite and we present an argument which indicates that the system should phase separate as long as none of the species for special cases is given in appendix b. we conclude in section vii and discuss some open questions . � we start by defining a three - species model which exhibits phase separation in @xmath0 . consider a one - dimensional , ring - like ( periodic ) lattice of length @xmath5 where each site is occupied by one of the three types of particles , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 . � the model evolves under a random sequential update procedure which is defined as follows : at each time step two neighboring sites are chosen randomly and the particles at these sites are exchanged according to the following rates @xmath9 the particles thus diffuse asymmetrically around the ring . � the dynamics conserves the number of particles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the three species . � the @xmath12 case is special . here � the dynamics is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move . � the system thus obeys detailed balance reaching a steady state in which all microscopic configurations ( compatible with the number of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equally probable . � the dynamics conserves the number the configuration is composed of a random sequence of domains of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 particles . due to the bias    the configuration is unstable and unstable .    the configuration is unstable and unstable .    the configuration is unstable and unstable .    the configuration is unstable and unstable .    the configuration is unstable and unstable and unstable and the two domains exchange places on a relatively short time scale which is linear in the domain size .    the configuration is unstable and unstable .    similarly , @xmath15 and @xmath16 domains are unstable too . on the other hand @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 configurations are stable and long lived . thus after a relatively short time the system reaches a state of the type @xmath20 in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains are located to the right of @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .     the evolution of this state takes place via a slow diffusion process in which , for example , the time scale for an @xmath6 particle to cross an adjacent @xmath7 domain is @xmath23 The current in the steady state is non - zero . � note that there are always small fluctuations about a totally phase separated state . � however , these fluctuations affect the densities only near the domain boundaries . they result in a finite width for the domain walls . � the fact that any phase separated state is stable for a time exponentially long in the system size amounts to a breaking of the translational symmetry . � since the exchange rates are asymmetric , the system generically supports a particle current in the steady state . to see this , � consider the @xmath6 domain in the phase separated state . � an @xmath6 particle near the @xmath28 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath7 domain to the right with an effective rate proportional to @xmath29 . � once it crosses the @xmath7 domain it will move through the @xmath8 domain with rate @xmath30 . similarly an @xmath6 particle near the @xmath31 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath8 domain to the left with a rate proportional to @xmath32 . � once the domain is crossed it moves through the @xmath7 domain with rate @xmath29 . � once it the dynamical rules are invariant under the transformation @xmath39 together with @xmath40 .  embodiments in this section we show that the dynamics ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , for the special case @xmath34 , satisfies detailed balance .  embodiments the corresponding hamiltonian , which determines the steady - state distribution , is found to have long - range asymmetric interactions . using this hamiltonian ,  embodiments we calculate analytically the partition sum and bounds on the correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit .  embodiments these are then used to prove the existence of phase separation in the model . later ,  embodiments in section [ matrixans ] we study finite systems for this case and the approach to the thermodynamic limit .  embodiments the general argument presented in the previous section suggests that for the special case @xmath34 , the steady state carries no current for any system size .  embodiments we demonstrate this explicitly by showing that the _ local dynamics _ of the model satisfies detailed balance with respect to a _ long - range asymmetric _  embodiments the hamiltonian @xmath41 .  embodiments we define the occupation variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 the variables @xmath45 and @ the hamiltonian @xmath41 does not determine the dynamics of the system , it just governs the steady - state distribution as given in ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) and ( [ eq : weight ] ) . escription ( [ eq : weight ] ) suggests that @xmath54 serves as a temperature variable with @xmath55 . escription thus , @xmath56 is the infinite - temperature limit . escription the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is written in a form which is not manifestly translationally invariant . escription however , careful examination reveals that when the relation @xmath34 is taken into account , the hamiltonian as given by ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is indeed translationally invariant ( see appendix b ) . escription therefore site @xmath57 may be chosen arbitrarily . escription an expression for @xmath41 which is manifestly translationally invariant will be derived at the end of this section . escription note that @xmath58 since the lhs yields the number of @xmath19 ( and @xmath19 ( and @xmath15 ) pairs in the system . using this relation the hamiltonian may also be written in a form where , where @xmath64 .     the energy of this exchange results in the contribution of one more @xmath65 term in @xmath66 and hence the energy of the resulting configuration is higher by @xmath57 .      it is easy to see using eq .   ( [ eq : weight ] ) that @xmath67 , as required by detailed balance .     it is easy to see using eq .   ( [ eq : weight ] ) that @xmath67 , as required by detailed balance .     it is easy to see that similar relations are easily derived for exchange of @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs .      we now consider an exchange taking place between sites @xmath5 and @xmath57 , say @xmath68 . according to ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) this exchange costs an energy of @xmath69 .      it is easy to see that @xmath69 , therefore the exchange satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath70 only when @xmath71 .      similarly , by considering the exchanges @xmath72 and @xmath73 , one deduces in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_tinvar ] ) the interaction is linear in the distance between the particles , and \u001c thus is long - ranged . � the distance is measured in a preferred direction from site @xmath1 to site @xmath80 . � moreover it is asymmetric in the sense that @xmath66 is not invariant under the parity operation . � it is also related to chiral hamiltonians @xcite .      before proceeding further to evaluate the partition sum and some correlation functions associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) � let us make a few observations . � the ground state of the hamiltonian is given by the fully separated state @xmath81 and its translationally related states . � the degeneracy of the ground state is thus @xmath5 and its energy is zero . � a simple way of evaluating the energy of an arbitrary configuration is obtained by noting that nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchanges @xmath82 and @xmath83 cost one unit of energy each while the reverse exchanges result in an energy gain of one unit . � the energy of an arbitrary configuration may thus be evaluated by starting @xmath15 nn pairs exist ; only @xmath87 and @xmath19 nn pairs may be found in addition to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains follow @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .     the metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains in which @xmath21 and @xmath8 domains follow @xmath22 and @xmath7 domains , respectively .    the metastable state is thus composed of a sequence of domains each of length @xmath57 .     therefore each metastable state has an equal number of domains , @xmath91 , of each type with @xmath92 .     the metastable state is thus composed of a total of @xmath93 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath93 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath94 corresponds to the @xmath95 state , composed of a total of @xmath5 domains each of length @xmath57 .    for calculating the (s may possess some translational symmetry ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one therefore has @xmath101 ^ 3 \\le{\\cal n}(s ) \\le n \\left[{n/3 - 1}\\choose { s-1}\\right]^3\\ ;

? ? * ) between late 2012 and mid-2014 ( table  [ tab : vlaobs ] ) at frequencies between 1 and 41 ghz ( table  [ tab : frequencytable ] ) . � vla observations were obtained in 8 separate observing bands , each with a total bandwidth of 2 ghz with the exception of l band observations , which had a total bandwidth of 1 ghz . for each band , � the correlator was configured with 16 spectral windows , each with 64 channels , for a total of 1024 channels spanning the bandwidth of 2 ghz ( 1 ghz in the case of l band ) . a means of demonstrating the large beams that occurred . � the ratio of q to l band beam sizes does not exactly follow the expected frequency scaling ratio , which is indicative of the poorly shaped beams from these snapshot observations and frequency - dependent weighting in the imaging stage . � we averaged the data in time into 30s intervals and in frequency for each spectral window . � we then exported the data for further analysis with our code . � we performed two kinds of analyses . � for the first , we extracted flux densities for sgr  a *  by averaging visibility amplitudes on baselines longer than 50 @xmath9 . � past experience has shown that these long baselines are sufficient to exclude the effects of extended structure on the flux density of sgr  a *  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ) . at high frequencies and in extended configurations , � we determine flux densities for sgr  a *  that are consistent with those provided by @xcite . � for the second analysis , we used a visibility subtraction method to determine deviations from the average flux density . � this method is important for low frequency observations in compact configurations , where the extended flux dominates that of s of the @xmath10 distance . � that is , longer baselines have greater weight than shorter baselines in order to bias against contamination from extended structure . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � we then averaged over each observing band and , again , calculated the error based on the scatter in the measurements . � this visibility subtraction scheme works well given the large number of data sets and the fine frequency resolution of the observations . � the frequency resolution permits us to make comparisons that are not limited by the steep spectral indices of some of the extended structures present in the galactic center . � the large number of data sets gives good overlap between extended and compact structures . � the method is sensitive to the effect of pairs of observations with significant overlap in @xmath10 coverage , i.e. , those conducted at the same sidereal time and in the same configuration . in this case � the method effectively differences those two epochs and does not provide a difference with respect to the average . � this effect can be seen in the epoch ]     ]      we carried out alma observations between mid-2013 and mid-2014 ( table  [ tab : almaobs ] ) , over eight epochs , each with band 6 ( 230 ghz ) and band 7 ( 345 ghz ) receivers .  *. each alma spectral window is plotted , covering 218 to 235 ghz ( top ) and 341 to 355 ghz ( bottom ) . � the two lower frequency spectral windows for each alma band are plotted with filled symbols . � these match most closely the plotted sma flux densities , which are in the range 212 to 241 ghz and 331 to 356 ghz , respectively , and have mean frequencies of 221 and 338 ghz . ]    .   [ fig : almasmaj1733 ] ]       observations of the flux density of sgr  a *  were obtained using the sma , an interferometric array of eight 6-m diameter radio dishes located near the summit of mauna kea , hawaii @xcite . in most cases � the sma was operating in a single receiver mode , providing 4 ghz continuum bandwidth in a single polarization , in two sidebands , with the array tuned to one of the three main sma bands ( 1.3 mm , 1.1 mm and 870 micron ) . � data were obtained during short ( @xmath1320 min ) , self - contained observation sets , in which observations of sgr  a for a polarization of 10 percent has an rms error of 7 percent . � this error is comparable to the level of the statistical errors . to this data set � were added more extensive observations over several hours in dual polarization mode on 5 july and 15 aug 2013 , which allowed short - term monitoring . � data from each observing period were calibrated with the millimeter interferometer reduction ( mir ) suite of reduction routines developed by the sma , involving removal of visibility phase scatter due to atmospheric instability and scaling visibility amplitude via comparison with the flux standard . � neptune was the primary flux standard used ( 85% of observations ) , with uranus ( 13% ) and titan ( 2% ) as the other standards . for uranus and neptune � , we used the spectral model from @xcite . � however , due to the presence of broad co absorption in the spectrum of neptune which is not included in the griffin and orton spectral fit , we opted to use data that were at least 8 ghz separated from either the co(1 - 2 ) or co(3 - 2 ) rotational transitions . for uranus and neptune � , we used the spectral model developed by author g in the sgr  a *  data .  In order to limit our data to sgr  a *  and likewise , the structure of the visibility data from sgr  a *  indicated we were sensitive to broad scale continuum emission from dust in the vicinity of sgr  a*. in order to limit our data to emission from sgr  a *  itself , we used only visibility data from baselines that exceeded 35 k@xmath14 , or roughly scales of 6or finer , which was sufficient to isolate sgr  a *  from the broader diffuse emission . indices from @xcite , along with a curve showing the extension of the nir spectral index to shorter wavelengths ( thin solid line ) .    [ see text for details . ]    at vla frequencies between 1 and 40 ghz , the mean spectral index @xmath17 is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and shows evidence for steepening at short wavelengths .     at alma frequencies between 1 and 40 ghz , a mean spectral index of 0.5 between 40 and 218 ghz is required to connect the vla and alma spectra , comparable to what has been seen previously @xcite .     at alma frequencies between 1 and 40 ghz , we also fit the alma data with a power - law spectrum ( figure  [ fig : alphaalma ] ) .     at alma frequencies between 217 and 355 ghz , the mean spectral index for frequencies between 217 and 355 ghz is @xmath20 , which is flatter and more variable than those of the calibrators .     at alma frequencies between 1 and 40 ghz , the calibrators have mean spectral indices between 217 and 355 ghz of @xmath21 , spectrum of sgr  a *  indicates that the optical depth is @xmath12 at frequencies as high as 690 ghz .     the result suggests that the source must be composed of stratified regions near the optically thick - to - thin transition in order to produce a near - flat synchrotron spectrum over this broad frequency range .    the result suggests that a single optically thin synchrotron component can not reproduce the spectrum .     this spectrum can be explained in the context of the classical @xcite jet model , but also by inflowing accretion flow models with radially evolving density and magnetic fields together with some non - thermal particles @xcite .    despite this degeneracy in the emission geometry ,    it is clear that above 350 ghz , sgr a * has to become optically thin .    this conclusion is supported by the transition to higher linear polarization at higher frequencies @xcite , and the increased variability and power - law spectrum seen in the infrared band .    the results of our simultaneous radio through submillimeter data can provide some interesting constraints on the underlying particle distribution , when put into context with the infrared measurements . in fig . , ranging from @xmath28 k , assuming an emission region of size @xmath29 . � the observed brightness temperature of sgr a * at 230 ghz is @xmath30 k @xcite . � these are fiducial values spanning the range from the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? � * and references therein ) , to illustrate how stratified , self - absorbed regions can add to a near - flat spectrum , but also to place some limits on the fraction and distribution of non - thermal particles present . � the peak of a given temperature component can shift by a factor of a few in frequency for different emission size regions or energy partition between radiating particles and the magnetic energy density . � however , it is clear that a peak temperature ( in the plasma closest to the black hole ) below a few @xmath31 k can not account for the extension of the self - absorbed spectrum through the alma range shown , and that a peak temperature much higher than a few @xmath32 k would violate the ir limits . � it is also clear from these spectra that a purely thermal distribution can not account for the ir flux . � the intersection of the ir power - law thermal peak may be difficult to match to these newest constraints . � therefore the combination of simultaneous alma ( eventually using even higher frequency bands ) and ir data offers the best constraints yet on the shape of the radiating particle distributions and nonthermal fraction . � the results presented here can already be used to guide implementation of the inclusion of particle acceleration in semi - analytical models and in the so - called `` painting '' of grmhd simulations to produce images ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � simultaneous observations between alma , ir , and x - ray , particularly during flaring , would provide strong constraints on the upper extreme of the nonthermal population and accelerating mechanisms .          bow shock emission from the interaction of g2 with the accretion flow was anticipated to appear and peak months before the center of mass reached periastron @xcite . � the bow shock would excite nonthermal electrons that then produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the accretion flow . � the synchrotron radiation The @xcite model g1 as a magnetically arrested , tidally distorted cloud , which has an area @xmath36 .    the @xcite model g2 as a wind driven from a hidden star with a radius that shrinks as the external pressure in the accretion flow increases , leading to a minimum area at periastron of @xmath37 .    the @xcite model g2 as a wind driven from a hidden star with a radius that shrinks as the external pressure in the accretion flow increases , leading to a minimum area at periastron of @xmath37 .    the @xcite predicts a characteristic timescale of four months , which is comparable to predictions in other models .     the l band data alone in the first and last epochs of our experiment show that no significant secular change has occurred over the course of this experiment .    the synchrotron lifetimes for the radiating electrons in the accretion inflow are long , so the timescale for the radio emission is determined by the dynamics of the bow shock .    the @xcite predicts a characteristic timescale of four months , which is comparable to predictions in other models .  .    the new data appear to show higher radio flux densities at frequencies @xmath45 ghz over historical averages ( figure  [ fig : specvla ] and table  [ tab : meanspec ] ) .    the 40.9 ghz flux density , for instance , has a mean of 1.5 jy and a range of 1.3 to 1.9 jy , whereas @xcite found a 43 ghz flux density mean of 1.0 jy and a range of 0.6 to 1.9 jy .    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are comparable to those of @xcite and @xcite .    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite presented many epochs of archival data obtained between 1979 and 1999 .    the flux densities from @xcite reported over 100 epochs with regular monitoring from 1979 to 2003 , while @xcite reported over 100 epochs with regular monitoring from 2000 to 2003 , while @xcite is from a single - epoch simultaneous spectrum .    over the whole radio spectrum    the flux densities from @xcite and @xcite are higher than those result may reflect some of the difficulties of providing accurate amplitude calibration for vlbi arrays . � a comparison against historical millimeter and submillimeter flux densities also does not reveal any significant change . � @xcite presents historical data for sgr  a *  at 230 , 345 , and 690 ghz with dates from 2001 through 2012 . � the flux densities from this paper span timescales from minutes to years and were obtained with multiple telescopes with varying calibration accuracy . the mean alma band 6 ( 230 ghz ) flux density is @xmath50 jy while the mean historical flux density at 230 ghz is @xmath51 jy . � similarly , for band 7 ( 345 ghz ) and historical 345 ghz data , we find @xmath52 jy and @xmath53 jy , respectively . results from the sma data are comparable . � thus , increases in the millimeter and submillimeter mean flux density are no more than 20% relative to historical averages , again consistent with typical llagn variability levels . � a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the alma and sma measurements are consistent ( @xmath54 ) with originating from the evidence that the millimeter and submillimeter changes are the result of the g2 periastron . � we have analyzed the light curve data for our measurements near 220 ghz from both alma and the sma . � there are 104 data points spanning an interval of 524 days with the shortest interval being 0.02 days . � the data were binned in a sparsely filled array of 32,768 elements and fourier transformed . � the resulting spectrum was averaged into logarithmically spaced frequency intervals . � the spectrum has a simple power law form characterized as @xmath59 over a frequency interval of 0.04 to 2 cycle / day . � the error bar was determined by bootstrap resampling . � this result is intuitively obvious from the light curve , i.e. the variations over a period of a few day are uncorrelated and have the same range as the variations over the entire data span . � the spectrum has a simple power law form characterized as @xmath59 over a frequency interval of 0.04 to 2 cycle / day . � @xmath17 was found to be @xmath60 . � the error bar was determined by bootstrap res be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole .     these observations do not resolve the nature of g2 .    the smaller bow shock size is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models .    the @xmath7 and @xcite propose a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent with our results .    the @xmath7 continuum observations reveal a compact source while br-@xmath6 observations reveal an extended source that appears to be tidally disrupted .    the @xmath7 and @xcite argue that the continuum emission is the photosphere of a binary stellar merger , while the ionized emission represents a smaller tidally disrupted tail .     the @xmath7 source has a cross - sectional area of @xmath61 @xmath62 , much less than our upper limit of @xmath0 @xmath62 .    the @xmath7 source has a cross - sectional area of @xmath61 @xmath62 , much less than our upper limit of @xmath0 @xmath retion rate .    the amplitude and timescale for a change in the accretion rate , should g2 be fully disrupted , are uncertain . in order for the disrupted material to enhance the flux density , the gas must reach a radius of a few schwarzschild radii to contribute to the accretion flow and/or enhance jet power . the free - fall time from @xmath63 is @xmath64 yr . if a fraction @xmath65 of the material were on a plunging orbit due to tidal disruption or a spread in orbital characteristics , we would have expected an enhancement of the overall flux density during these observations .    the flux density should scale as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a model - dependent constant for jet and accretion disk models . for a g2 mass of @xmath68 appropriate for the gas - cloud model and a steady - state accretion rate onto sgr  a *  of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 for @xmath72 .    we find @xmath71 for @xmath72 .    the flux density should scale as @xmath72 .    the flux density should scale - term stability of the radio / millimeter spectrum  champion , d.  j. , keane , e.  f. , desvignes , g. , desvignes , g. , schnitzeler , d.  h.  f.  m. , spitler , l.  g. , kramer , m. ,

[ fig : mass ] we have calculated the thermodynamic potential perturbatively in the large-@xmath0 limit and the effective mass of the quarks is determined by using fermi - liquid theory for an imbalanced cold dense quark system .    from the rpa results , the temperature dependence is obtained by using the gluon self - energy , from which the contributions from transverse and longitudinal glu temperature .    the non - fermi - liquid behavior , due to unscreened long - range magnetic interactions , was already discussed several decades ago for the case of the electron gas @xcite . in the large-@xmath0 \u0018 limit the qcd thermodynamic potential is essentially the same as that of qed , apart from group theory factors .    the non - abelian effects of qcd only show up if gluon self - interaction corrections are included .    the logarithmic behavior in the balanced case has previously been seen in analytic and numerical calculations of the qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat using the large-@xmath0 limit , dimensional reduction , and hard - dense loop qcd perturbation theory @xcite .    we expect that such a logarithmic dependence shall have important effects on the imbalanced qcd phase diagram at low temperatures and directly influence the properties of quark matter in the core of neutron stars . to better understand these effects , it is necessary to go further , such as including the gluon self -

      "generated": "have recently given a combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group @xmath1 , and , more generally , for the demazure characters @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this model was defined in the context of the equivariant @xmath2-theory of the generalized flag variety @xmath3 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ our character formulas were derived from a chevalley - type formula in @xmath4 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the langland s dual group @xmath7 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ alcove paths correspond to decompositions of elements in the affine weyl group . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ our chevalley - type formula was was expressed in terms of a certain @xmath8-matrix , that is , in terms of a collection of operators satisfying the yang - baxter equation . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this setup allowed us to easily explain the independence of our formulas from the choice of an al .  embodiments for instance , a straight line initial path leads to the lakshmibai - seshadri paths ( ls paths ) .  embodiments these were introduced before littelmann s work , in the context of standard monomial theory  @xcite .  embodiments they have a nonrecursive description as weighted chains in the bruhat order on the quotient @xmath10 of the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 modulo the stabilizer @xmath11 of the weight @xmath0 ; therefore , we will use the term ls chains when referring to this description .  embodiments ls paths were used by pittie and ram @xcite to derive a @xmath12-chevalley formula .  embodiments recently , gaussent and littelmann  @xcite , motivated by the study of mirkovi - vilonen cycles , defined another combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group .  embodiments this model is based on ls - galleries , which are certain sequences of faces of alcoves for the corresponding affine weyl group . according to @xcite , for each ls - gallery there is an associated littelmann chains of positive roots defined by certain interlacing conditions . � these new objects extend the notion of a reflection ordering @xcite , and have many interesting combinatorial properties , some of which are investigated in this paper . � the extension from the finite to the infinite case is nontrivial since the description in terms of the affine weyl groups and alcoves is no longer available in the latter case . � compared to the geometric approach in @xcite ( involving the equivariant @xmath2-theory of @xmath3 ) , the generalization in this paper is carried out purely in the context of representation theory , and , in this process , new features of our model are added . � for instance , we define root operators in our model , and study their properties . � this allows us to show that our model satisfies the axioms of an admissible system of stembridge @xcite . � thus , we easily derive character formulas , a littlewood - richardson rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations , as well as a branching rule . the approach via admissible systems was already applied to ls chains in ( * ? ? ? � * section 8) coincide with kashiwara s crystals ( called here perfect crystals ) of the corresponding irreducible integrable highest weight modules @xcite .     furthermore , the independence of our model from the choice of a @xmath0-chain was proved in @xcite in the finite case .     furthermore , in this case , we know that our semiperfect crystals are perfect crystals for any choice of a @xmath0-chain .     furthermore , we briefly discuss the relationship between our model and the littelmann path model ( in the kac - moody setup ) .     furthermore , the former is a discrete counterpart of the latter without being simply a translation of it into a different language .     furthermore , both models are based on certain choices ( of a @xmath0-chain and of an initial path , respectively ) .     however , in its full generality , the path model is a recursive one , as explained above , whereas ours is a nonrecursive one .     furthermore , the definition of root operators in our model always involves reflecting a single segment in a @xmath0-chain , whereas several segments of a path might be reflected in the path model ( cf .     furthermore , when a path is deformed into one which passes through the intersection of these hyperplanes .    the lost information needs to be recovered , but this is done by a nontrivial lift ( in some cases , such as the one related to the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite , the lost information needs to be recovered , but this is done by a nontrivial lift from @xmath10 to @xmath5 ; the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite based on our model obviates this lift . )    the main advantage of our model is related to its combinatorial nature .    the main advantage of this model is computationally efficient because it uses simple labels for the vertices of an irreducible crystal , namely certain finite sets of positive integers ( called admissible subsets ) ; these can be efficiently constructed .    the main advantage of our model is that although a @xmath0-chain might be an infinite object , we do not need to store it , since we always work with a finite set of objects ( cf . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ remark [ finiteness ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ more precisely , all we need is a making extra choices after the initial choice ( of an initial path , of a sequence of alcoves / lower dimensional faces of them , or of a @xmath0-chain ) .    because unlike ls - galleries , our model extends to the kac - moody case . xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 for some integer @xmath32 , as well as @xmath23 such that @xmath33 , we have @xmath34    it turns out that , in the finite case , condition  ( 2 ) is equivalent to a condition stating that any triple of roots @xmath29 with @xmath35 satisfies the following interlacing property : there is exactly one element from the set @xmath36 between any two consecutive @xmath37 s , as well as before the first @xmath37 ; and there are no @xmath27 s or @xmath38 s after the last @xmath37 .    it turns out that , according to condition  ( 1 ) , the index set @xmath22 is always a countable or a finite set .    it turns out that , according to condition  ( 1 ) , the index set @xmath22 is always a countable or a finite set .     it turns out that , however , it is not always order - isomorphic to a subset of @xmath39 .     it turns out that , for example , it may contain infinite intervals chain @xmath19 .    for @xmath19 , let us say that a finite subset @xmath44 of the index set @xmath22 is admissible if the roots @xmath45 are labels of an increasing saturated chain in the bruhat order starting at the identity element , i.e. , we have : @xmath46    for @xmath16 and @xmath47 , let @xmath48 be the affine reflection given by @xmath49 . for a @xmath0-chain ,    let @xmath50 be the associated sequence of nonnegative integers defined by @xmath51 .    for a @xmath0-chain @xmath19 , let @xmath50 be the associated sequence of nonnegative integers defined by @xmath51 .    for a @xmath0-chain @xmath19 , let us define the weight @xmath52 of an admissible subset @xmath53 by @xmath54    for a dominant integral weight @xmath0 and any @xmath0-chain @xmath19 , the character @xmath55 of the irreducible representation @xmath18 is math67 : @xmath68    we will define a colored graph structure on the collection of admissible subsets . from this , we will deduce a rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations and a branching rule .    the general outline of the paper follows . in section  [ sec : notation ]  [ sec : notation ] , we review basic notions related to roots systems for complex symmetrizable kac -

This is partly due to the fact that the gw signal expected from compact binary coalescences , the likely progenitors of short grbs , is fairly well understood as a function of the ( often unknown ) source properties .    This is partly due to the fact that the detection of gws can provide estimates or constraints on these source properties .    This is partly due to the fact that we presented a detailed overview of the questions that can be addressed about short - grb progenitors upon the detection of their gw signature .    This is partly due to the fact that the core - collapse of massive stars , the likely progenitor of long grbs , has less constrained theoretical gw emission models .    This is partly due to the lack of our detailed understanding of the progenitor ( e.g. , how cores maintain their high rotation rate prior to collapse ) , and partly due to the complex dynamics of the collapsing core and the resulting compact object ( protoneutron star or black hole ) and accretion disk , whose understanding requires further theoretical and numerical studies .

      "generated": "their name suggests , compact groups are small systems of several galaxies in a compact configuration on the sky .  embodiments the first example was found over one hundred years ago by stephan ( 1877 ) who observed it visually using the 40-cm refractor of the observatoire de marseille . stephan s quintet is a small group of five galaxies ,  embodiments a second example was found 71 years later by seyfert ( 1948 ) from a study of harvard schmidt plates .  embodiments a second example was found over one hundred years ago by stephan ( 1877 ) who observed it visually using the 40-cm refractor of the observatoire de marseille . stephan s quintet is a small group of five galaxies ,  embodiments the second example was found 71 years later by seyfert ( 1948 ) from a study of harvard schmidt plates .  embodiments seyfert s sextet ( figure 1 ) is one of the densest groups known , having a median projected galaxy separation of only @xmath1 kpc ( the hubble constant @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) .  embodiments the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) ian 1973 , shakhbazian & petrosian 1974 , baier et al 1974 , petrosian 1974 , 1978 , baier & tiersch 1975 - 79 ) .     these systems are not visible to the naked eye , apart from occasional photographic or spectroscopic observations ( eg .    mirzoian et al 1975 , tiersch 1976 , massey 1977 , shakhbazian & amirkhanian 1979 , vorontsov - velyaminov et al 1980 , vorontsov - velyaminov & metlov 1980 ) these systems initially received little attention .     however , interest in them is growing .     these systems are not visible to the naked eye , although the majority seem to be small clusters , they share some of the properties , and pose some of the same questions , as do compact groups .    when redshifts were measured for galaxies in the first compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961a ) , surprises were found .    in hindsight , it was argued that both stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet contain a galaxy with a discordant redshift . ian 1961 ) , although limber and mathews ( 1960 ) showed that the virial theorem could be satisfied for stephan s quintet , given the uncertainties in the projection factors , if the individual galaxy masses were considerably larger than those of isolated galaxies . of a compact group is discussed , along with methods of identification and surveys that have been made . in sections 3 - 5 ,  the observed properties of these systems are summarized and discussed .    in sections 6 and 7 focus mainly on interpretation of the observations , and on implications of these results .     in sections 8 and 9 ,    all work on compact groups of galaxies can not possibly be discussed in this short paper , although an attempt is made to touch upon most current topics .      other recent reviews of compact groups and closely related subjects include those by white ( 1990 ) , hickson ( 1990 , 1997 ) , whitmore ( 1992 ) , kiseleva & orlov ( 1993 ) , sulentic ( 1993 ) , and mamon ( 1995 ) .    in these reviews , we are looking at a small , relatively isolated , system of typically four or five galaxies in close proximity to one another .    in this review , we are looking at a small , relatively isolated , system of galaxies in close proximity to one another .     in this review , we are looking at a small , relatively isolated , system of typically four or five galaxies in close proximity to one another . 170 triplets , 33 quartets , and 2 quintets .     unfortunately , the sample received little follow - up study .    sulentic ( 1983 ) re - examined the 35 rose groups which contain four or more galaxies and found that only a third actually satisfied the selection criteria .     this is testimony to the difficulty of visual searches .     a more fundamental problem is that the fixed magnitude limit in the selection criteria makes the sample susceptible to strong distance - dependent biases .    in an attempt to reduce such effects , hickson ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) adopted a relative magnitude criterion , selecting systems of four or more galaxies whose magnitudes differ by less than 3.0 .    in order to reduce such biases , a distance independent ( to first order ) compactness criterion was employed : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean surface brightness of the member galaxies over the smallest circular area containing their geometric centers . to avoid including the cores of rich clusters , an isolation criterion was necessary so as to reject the group if a non - member galaxy , not more than 3 mag fainter than the brightest member , occurred within three radii of the center of the circle . non - spherical systems will be preferentially selected if they are oriented to present a smaller cross - sectional area ( eg . \u001c prolate systems pointed towards us ) ; the latter because we will preferentially select systems that , owing to galaxy orbital motion , are momentarily in a more compact state ( transient compact configurations ) . � thus , a compact group might result from a chance alignment or transient configuration within a loose group ( mamon 1986 ) . � this question will be considered in more detail in section 6.2 . � other biases arise from the subjective nature of the search procedure . � the original catalog contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . � in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used . � the catalog contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars , and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . � in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog ( hickson et al 1989 ) , it was found that some groups would ( hickson 1982 ) . � yet another effect is that groups may be more noticeable if the magnitude spread of their members is small . � thus , the catalog may also be incomplete for magnitude intervals greater than about 1.5 ( prandoni et al 1994 ) . � these effects are of critical importance in statistical analyses of the sample . � one immediate conclusion is that the actual number of groups which satisfy the selection criteria may be considerably larger than the number found by a subjective search . � it has recently become feasible to find compact groups by automated techniques . � mamon ( 1989 ) used a computer to search tully s ( 1987 ) catalog of nearby galaxies and identified one new compact group , satisfying hickson s criteria , in the virgo cluster . � prandoni et al ( 1994 ) applied similar criteria to digital scans of @xmath6 deg@xmath7 around the southern galactic pole and detected 59 new southern compact groups ( scgs ) . � it has recently become feasible to find compact groups by automated techniques . � mamon ( 1989 ) used a computer to search tully s ( 1987 ) catalog of nearby galaxies and identified one new compact group , satisfying hickson s criteria , in the virgo cluster and line - of - sight velocity differences of 1000 km s@xmath3 or less are connected and the sets of connected galaxies constitute the groups . the numerical values were chosen to best match the characteristics of the hcg sample , and indeed , many of those rscgs that have at least four members are also hcgs . � there are some significant differences , however : because foreground and background galaxies are automatically eliminated by the velocity selection criteria , this technique is more effective at finding groups in regions of higher galaxy density , which would fail the hcg isolation criterion . � this criterion requires that the distance to the nearest neighbor be at least as large as the diameter of the group . � the rscg criteria , on the other hand , require only that the nearest - neighbor distance be larger than the threshold distance ( @xmath8 kpc for the rscgs ) , which may be considerably smaller � this criterion requires that the distance to the nearest neighbor be at least as large as the diameter of the group . � this criterion requires that the distance to the nearest - neighbor be at least as large as the diameter of the group . � the rscg criteria , on the other hand , require only that the nearest - bias . � the space distribution and environment of compact groups provides important clues to their nature . � the median redshift of the hcgs is @xmath9 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) . � a cursory inspection reveals that they are fairly uniformly distributed and show no preference for rich clusters . � this is at least partly due to the isolation criterion . � however , galaxies in rich clusters have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in compact groups , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups . � a natural question is whether or not compact groups are associated with loose groups and clusters . � rood & struble ( 1994 ) observed that 70% of the hcgs are located within the bounds of cataloged loose groups and clusters . � studies of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( vennik et al 1993 , ramella et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , sakai et al 1994 , garcia 1995 , barton et al 1996 ) indicate that compact sub - condensations do occur within loose groups and filaments . most of the hcg associations identified by ramella et al ( 1996 ) contain fewer than 5 excess galaxies . � thus while compact groups are associated with loose groups and filaments , these tend to be low - density and sparsely - populated systems . � are the galaxies in compact groups in any way distinct from those in their immediate environments ? � rood & williams ( 1989 ) and kindl ( 1990 ) both found that compact groups , including those in rich environments , contain a significantly smaller fraction of late - type ( spiral and irregular ) galaxies than do their neighborhoods . � this result is of particular importance to the question of the physical nature of compact groups , discussed below in section 6 . � in addition , many independent studies have found significant differences between galaxies in compact groups and those in other environments . � these are examined in section 5 . � the first studies of individual compact groups ( burbidge & burbidge 1959 , 1961b , 1961c , burbidge & sargent 1971 , rose & graham 1979 , kirshner & malumuth 1980 ) indicated short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters . however , because of the small xmath10 km s@xmath3 ( the sharp peak at zero velocity results from the use of the median ) . � this characteristic velocity is quite similar to velocity dispersions found in loose groups , and much smaller than typical velocity dispersions in rich clusters . � in addition to the gaussian core , a flat component is seen in the velocity distribution of figure 2 . � this is expected as some galaxies which are not physically related to the group will appear projected on the group by chance . � this component contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies . whether of not chance projection � can account for such a large number of `` discordant '' galaxies is still a matter of some debate , and is discussed further in section 6.1 .     for a system of characteristic linear size @xmath11 and internal velocity @xmath12 , � this component contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies . � a characteristic mass density is @xmath14 , from which one can estimate the total mass within the region occupied by the galaxies . � can account for such a large number of `` discordant '' galaxies is still a matter of some debate , and is discussed further in section 6.1 . The study of the spatial distribution and luminosities of the member galaxies provides further clues to the nature of compact groups . � if they are primarily projections or transient configurations , the luminosity function should be the same as that of the parent systems , and the spatial distribution of the galaxies should be consistent with a random distribution . � if they are bound physical systems , the luminosity function and spatial distribution might show features that reflect the origin or subsequent evolution of compact groups . � the shapes of compact groups were first investigated by arp ( 1973 ) who concluded that galaxy `` chains '' were unusually predominant . however , rose ( 1977 ) determined that the ellipticities of his groups were consistent with a random distribution of galaxies . using the larger hcg sample , hickson et al ( 1984 ) and � malykh & orlov ( 1986 ) reached the same conclusion as arp � the shapes of compact groups were typically more elongated than would be a random distribution of galaxies . � an immediate consequence of this result is that compact groups can not easily be explained as random projections or chance crossings , as this would largely erase any inherent ellipticity of a parent loose group . from static simulations , � hickson et al ( 1984 ) concluded that noticed in visual searches � . it will be interesting to see if these results are confirmed by studies of groups found by automated searches . � if the intrinsic shapes of compact groups are related to their formation process , one might expect to see a relationship between the orientation angle of a group and the environment . � palumbo et al ( 1993 ) examined the environments of the hcgs , and found that the orientations of the major axes of the groups were consistent with an isotropic distribution . � if compact groups are not simply projection effects , they might be expected to show a centrally - concentrated surface density profile , as is seen in clusters of galaxies . although the number of galaxies in individual compact groups is small , with a large sample it is possible to estimate a mean profile . by scaling and superimposing � the hcgs , hickson et al ( 1984 ) found evidence for central concentration . � mendes de oliveira & girard ( 1994 ) , using a similar analysis , concluded that the mean surface density profile is consistent with a king ( 1962 ) model with typical core radius of 15@xmath19 kpc . � most recently , montoya et al ( 1996 ) have analyzed the profiles of the 42 hcg oya et al ( 1996 ) suggest that this arises as a result of a minimum mass density and velocity dispersion that is required for the groups to be virialized ( mamon 1994 ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ .       there have been several studies of the morphological types of galaxies in compact groups ( hickson 1982 , williams & rood 1987 , sulentic 1987 , hickson et al 1988b ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ most studies agree that the fraction @xmath21 of late type galaxies is significantly less in compact groups than in the field . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ hickson et al ( 1988b ) find @xmath22 for the hcgs ; prandoni et al ( 1994 ) obtain @xmath23 for the scgs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ both these values are substantially lower than those found for field galaxy samples ( @xmath24 , gisler 1980 , nilson 1973 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ also well established is morphological type concordance , observed in both the hcgs and scgs ( sulentic 1987 , hickson at al 1988b , prandoni et al 1994 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a given compact group is more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for . � a crucial clue is that the morphology - density relation seen in clusters and loose groups ( dressler 1980 , postman & geller 1984 , whitmore & gilmore 1992 ) is not the dominant correlation in compact groups ( hickson et al 1988b ) , although some effect is present ( mamon 1986 ) . � this suggests that the velocity dispersion is more fundamental , ie of greater physical relevance to the formation and evolution of galaxies in compact groups , than is apparent physical density . � there is much evidence that interaction is occurring in a large fraction of galaxies in compact groups . � the strongest direct support comes from kinematical studies . � rubin et al ( 1991 ) found that two thirds of the 32 hcg spiral galaxies that they observed have peculiar rotation curves . � these show asymmetry , irregularity and in some cases extreme distortion , characteristic of strong gravitational interaction . � this result has recently been challenged by mendes de oliveira et al ( preprint ) who obtained h@xmath25 velocity maps for 26 hcg spiral galaxies and found that only 1/3 showed abnormal rotation curves . � they suggest that the difference is due to the more - complete spatial sampling of their data . itudes and colors . � they therefore do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other elliptical galaxies . � they therefore do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other elliptical galaxies . � this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies that have `` disky '' or irregular isophotes tend to have lower velocity dispersion . � this discrepancy correlates with isophote shape in that those galaxies that have `` disky '' or irregular isophotes tend to have lower velocity dispersion . � both zepf & whitmore ( 1993 ) and bettoni & fasano ( 1993 , 1995 , 1996 , fasano & bettoni 1994 ) report that hcg elliptical galaxies are less likely to have `` boxy '' isophotes , and more likely to have irregular isophotes . � such effects are consistent with results of simulations of tidal encounters ( balcells & quinn 1990 ) . � the luminosity function of compact groups was first estimated by heiligman & turner ( 1980 ) . � they examined a sample consisting of stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and eight more compact groups from the arp and vorontsov - sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � sulentic and rabaa ( 1994 ) � obtained a luminosity function for hcg galaxies similar to that of field galaxies . � however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . � for example , the luminosity range within an individual group is limited by the 3-mag range of the selection criteria . � because of this , fainter galaxies within compact groups are not included in the catalog . in order to account for such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to groups . � redshifts were given to each group according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . � the luminosity distribution of the resulting galaxy sample was then compared to the observations and the process repeated with different trial luminosity functions . � their best - fit luminosity function is deficient in faint galaxies , although a normal field - galaxy luminosity function is not excluded .    to avoid the selection problem , ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) obtained deeper photometry in terms of the schechter ( 1976 ) parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 . � how do we interpret these apparently conflicting results ? � prandoni et al ( 1994 ) have argued that the hcg catalog is biased toward groups with a small magnitude range @xmath30 , because the scgs have a larger fraction of high @xmath30 groups . � however , it is not known what fraction of such groups are physically real , as few redshifts have yet been obtained . � such a bias could affect the luminosity function of mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) , particularly at the faint end , but it is not evident that the bias is sufficient to account for the apparent faint - galaxy deficit . � on the other hand , the small sample used by ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) may not be representative of compact groups in general . � hickson ( 1997 ) points out that the ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) sample has a spiral fraction of 0.60 , substantially higher than that of the whole hcg catalogue , and contains 7 of the 16 hcgs found to be in a high density environment by palumbo et al ( 1995 ) . remark that `` the members of stephan s quintet are to be classed among the brightest of galaxies '' .    it is possible that this may be in part due to interaction - induced star formation , at least for the spiral galaxies . on the other hand mendes    mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) compared their luminosity function of elliptical galaxies in compact groups with those in the virgo and coma clusters ( as reported by sandage et al 1985 and thompson & gregory 1980 ) and found that that the compact - group ellipticals have a luminosity enhancement of more than 1 mag compared to cluster ellipticals .    mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) found a similar enhancement in their morphological - type - specific luminosity function .    this suggests that compact group elliptical galaxies may have a unique formation mechanism .    from the luminosity function    from the luminosity function of ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) , one can estimate the contribution of compact groups of galaxies @xmath31 to the total galaxian luminosity density @xmath32 .    applying the same analysis to the luminosity function of ribeiro et endy & sanders 1992 , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . � compact groups , with their high galaxy density and evident signs of galaxy interaction should be ideal systems in which to study such effects . � many hcgs do in fact contain galaxies showing starbursts or harboring active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . for example , hcg 16 is found to contain a seyfert 2 galaxy , two liners , and three starburst galaxies ( ribeiro et al 1996 ) . � hcg 31 contains five galaxies showing signs of recent starburst activity ( rubin et al 1990 , iglesias - pramo & vlchez preprint ) . � seyfert galaxies are also found in hcg 77 , 92 , 93 and 96 . � the general degree of star formation activity in compact group galaxies can be determined from infrared observations . to date � the studies have been based primarily on data from the iras satellite . � hickson et al ( 1989 ) found sources in 40 hcg from a search of the point source catalog . � they concluded that the ratio of far - infrared - to - optical luminosity is greater by about a factor of two in error . � analysis of improved data ( eg . allam et al 1996 ) should soon resolve questions about the identifications and infrared fluxes . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � the resolution problem can be avoided by considering the infrared colors of the sources instead of the infrared / optical ratio . � zepf ( 1993 ) compared the ratio of 60 @xmath35 m to 100 @xmath35 m fluxes of compact group galaxies with those of isolated galaxies and also with those of galaxies believed to be currently merging . � he found that the compact group sample was significantly different from both other samples , and estimated that about 1/3 of the compact group galaxies had warm colors ( larger 60/100 @xmath35 m ratios ) similar to those of merging galaxies . � another approach to interpreting the infrared results was taken by menon ( 1991 ) who emphasized that the strong correlation between radio and infrared radiation indicates that these likely originate from a common region . in compact group spirals the radio emission is primarily nuclear whereas in isolated spirals it originates in the disk . � if this is also true for the infrared flux , there must be an enhancement .     menon ( 1995 ) observed 133 spiral galaxies in 68 hcg , and found that overall they typically show less continuum emission than those in isolated environments , which is consistent with the neutral hydrogen observations .     however , when considering the nuclear regions alone , the radio emission is found to be an order of magnitude higher compared to isolated spirals .     the implication is that star formation and/or agn activity is substantially enhanced in the nuclear regions of many compact group spiral galaxies .     this is generally consistent with a picture in which galaxy interactions remove gas from the outer regions of galaxies , while simultaneously allowing gas to flow inwards toward the nucleus , resulting in enhanced star formation in the nuclear region , and possibly fueling an active nucleus .     although there is a clear example of tidal interaction stimulating disk radio emission in at least one compact group ( menon 1995a ) , statistical evidence for a link between interactions and radio emission in compact groups is only now accumulating .     if interactions are stimulating nuclear radio emission , one would expect the radio luminosity to be correlated with some index describing the degree of interaction such as the projected distance to the nearest neighbor .     evidence in support of this was found by vettolani & gregorini ( 1988 k menon , private communication ) . � continuum radio emission has also been detected in a number of hcg elliptical galaxies . unlike those found in cluster ellipticals , the radio sources are low - luminosity and compact . where spectral indices are available � , they indicate that the radio emission arises from an agn rather than from starburst activity ( tk menon , private communication ) . in the hcg sample � , there is a significant preference for radio - loud elliptical galaxies to be first - ranked optically ( menon & hickson 1985 , menon 1992 ) . � the probability of radio emission does not correlate with absolute luminosity , but instead correlates with _ relative _ luminosity within a group . � spiral hcg galaxies do not show this effect . although the tendency of radio galaxies in rich clusters to be first - ranked has been known for many years , it is surprising to find a similar effect in small groups , where the number of galaxies and luminosity range is small � the probability of radio emission does not correlate with absolute luminosity , and it is unlikely that any individual galaxy holds a central location . the effect of optical rank on radio emission had been previously noted in other small groups by tov the conclusion that most of his groups must be transient configurations . � however , bergvall et al ( 1981 ) were successful in detecting ionized gas and a common halo around a compact quartet of interacting early - type galaxies , and evidence for a common halo in vv 172 was reported by sulentic & lorre ( 1983 ) . ��� diffuse light can clearly be seen in hcg 94 , and has been found in hcg 55 ( sulentic 1987 ) , but pildis et al ( 1995b ) did not detect any in seven other compact groups . ��� analysis by mamon ( 1986 ) indicated that while the expected diffuse light should be detectable with modern techniques , it would generally be very faint . ��� estimates of the total amount of diffuse light in the detected groups are rather uncertain as they depend sensitively on subtraction of the galactic light , and the sky background . ��� analysis by mamon ( 1986 ) indicated that the expected diffuse light in the detected groups may yet reveal diffuse light in other compact groups ( sulentic 1997 ) . ��� the mass and distribution of cool galactic and intergalactic gas , can be obtained from observations of the 21-cm line radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . al ( 1984 ) � first detected x - ray emission from stephan s quintet . � the x - ray map revealed that the emission is diffuse and not centered on individual galaxies . � however , we now know that most of this emission is associated with a shock front rather than gas trapped in the group potential well ( sulentic et al 1995 ) . � although several other groups ( bahcall et al 1984 , biermann & kronberg 1984 ) were detected by the einstein observatory , further progress required the improved sensitivity of the rosat x - ray observatory � .    pointed rosat observations revealed massive hydrogen envelopes surrounding the ngc 2300 group , a bright elliptical - spiral pair with two fainter members ( mulchaey et al 1993 ) , and hcg 62 , a compact quartet of early - type galaxies ( ponman & bertram 1993 ) , and showed that these systems are dominated by dark matter . � subsequent investigations detected x - rays from 18 additional compact groups , either from individual galaxies , or from diffuse gas ( ebeling et al 1994 , pildis et al 1995a , sarraco & ciliegi 1995 , sulent to be spiral poor , and led to the suggestion that spiral - rich compact groups might not be physically dense systems at all . and the gas mass continue to increase with radius . consequently , both the baryon fraction and the gas fraction are poorly determined . � the contribution of compact groups to the x - ray luminosity function has been estimated by pbeb , who find that on the order of 4% of the total luminosity in the range @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 comes from hcgs . � this is higher than the contribution of hcg galaxies to the local optical luminosity density estimated at 0.8% by mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) , but it is comparable to the value found by ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) . � the metallicity inferred for the x - ray - emitting gas in compact groups is relatively low . � pbeb obtain a mean metallicity of 0.18 solar , compared to the value , 0.3 - 0.4 solar , found in rich clusters . � this is comparable to the low value ( @xmath39 solar ) found for the ngc 2300 group ( davis et al 1996 ) . � these figures suggest that the gas is largely primordial , a result supported by the absence of a correlation between x - ray 1971 , nottale & moles 1978 , sulentic 1983 ) .     if the frequency of discordant galaxies is inconsistent with the statistics of chance projection , it might signify the need for new physical theories ( arp 1987 ) , or for gravitational amplification of background galaxies ( hammer & nottale 1986 ) .    the initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) .     in the absence of a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects ,    the initial estimates of the chance probability of finding discordant galaxies in groups like stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and vv 172 , were very small ( burbidge & sargent 1971 ) .    in the absence of a well - defined sample of groups and a complete characterization of selection effects ,    only with a well - defined sample of groups can meaningful estimates of the probabilities be made .     the explicit selection criteria of the hcg catalog in principal makes this sample suitable for a - carlo simulations .       their technique exploits the unbiased nature of the scg catalog and the complete redshift coverage of the hcg sample .        they conclude that for all except the two highest - surface - brightness quintets ( stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet ) , the number of discordant redshifts is consistent with chance projections .        for these two , the chance probabilities are low . however , for both of these systems there is independent physical evidence that the discordant galaxies are at the cosmological distances that correspond to their redshifts and are therefore not group members ( kent 1981 , wu et al 1994 ) . isolated bound dense configurations ( sulentic 1987 , hickson & rood 1988 ) 3 .   hypothesis of chance alignments in loose groups ( mamon 1986 , walke & mamon 1989 , mamon 1995 ) 4 .   hypothesis of chance alignments and filaments seen end - on ( hernquist et al 1995 ) 5 .   bound dense configurations within loose groups ( diaferio et al 1994 , governato et al 1996 )    evidence for and against physical association and high density in the hcg sample , to 1988 , was summarized by hickson & rood ( 1988 ) , and by walke and mamon ( 1989 ) respectively . since that time , several new results have emerged . from an analysis of optical images , mendes Â de oliveira & hickson ( 1994 ) concluded that 43% of all hcg galaxies show morphological features indicative of interaction and/or merging , and that 32% of all hcgs contain three or more interacting galaxies .   these percentages are likely to rise with more - detailed studies and sophisticated image analysis ( longo et al 1994 ) .    this high frequency of interactions observed in compact groups is difficult to reconcile with the chance alignment et al ( 1995 ) have argued that the relatively low x - ray luminosities of compact groups might not be due to a low gas fraction , but instead could be understood if the groups are filaments seen in projection ( hernquist et al 1995 ) . however , ponman et al ( 1996 ) point out that in order to explain even the fainter compact groups , gas temperatures @xmath40 kev and densities @xmath41 @xmath42 would be required . these appear to be ruled out by both observations ( briel & henry 1995 ) and simulations ( diaferio et al 1995 , pildis et al 1996 ) . \u001c even if compact groups are physically dense , they may not be as dense as they appear . \u001c as mentioned in section 2 , a sample of groups selected on the basis of high apparent density will be biased by the inclusion of looser systems which appear more compact due to geometrical or kinematic effects . \u001c is this bias large ? \u001c its magnitude can be estimated as follows : consider @xmath43 galaxies randomly located within a circle of radius @xmath11 on the sky . \u001c what is the probability @xmath44 that they will fall within 50 and @xmath51 . � here we have neglected a small edge contribution that is unimportant for small values of @xmath52 ( walke and mamon s case 3 ) . � this gives f(x , n ) = n^2 x^2n-2 now , an observer would infer a galaxy space density that is higher by a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor @xmath53 , so the average apparent space density enhancement is < > & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 n^2 x^2n-5 dx + & = & 2n^2(n-1)(2n-5)(2n-3)(n-2 ) thus we expect to typically overestimate the space density by about a factor of 12.0 for triplets ( or quartets containing a physical binary ) , 3.2 for true quartets al ( 1994 ) conclude that compact groups form continually from bound subsystems within loose groups .     this gains some support from the observation ( see section 3 ) that most hcgs are embedded in loose groups , although it is not obvious that these loose groups are sufficiently rich ( sulentic 1997 ) .    sulentic et al ( 1994 ) , and governato et al ( 1996 ) , proposed a model in which merging activity in compact groups is accompanied by infall of galaxies from the environment .     this naturally explains the observed mix of morphological types , and it allows compact groups to persist for longer times .    where do the shakhbazian groups fit in this picture ?    where do the shakhbazian groups fit in this picture ?    most recent studies ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , amirkhanian et al 1988 , 1991 , amirkhanian 1989 , kodaira et al 1988 - 91 , stoll et al 1993 - 1996 ) show that these objects are typically compact clusters or groups of early - type galaxies .     although the systems were selected on the basis of red colors and compact ynamic simulations indicate that the dark matter halos of individual galaxies merge first , creating a massive envelope within which the visible galaxies move ( barnes 1984 , bode et al 1993 ) . � kinematic studies of loose groups ( eg . � puche & carignan 1991 ) indicate that the dark matter is concentrated around the individual optical galaxies . � in contrast , the x - ray observations indicate that in most compact groups , the gas and dark matter is more extended and is decoupled from the galaxies . � this may explain the observation that galaxies in compact groups typically have mass - to - light ratios 30% to 50% lower than more isolated galaxies ( rubin et al 1991 ) . � is there any observational evidence that galaxies in compact groups are merging ? by 1982 it was evident that first - ranked galaxies in compact groups did not appear to be merger products , because the fraction of first - ranked galaxies that are type e or s0 is the same as for the general population of hcg galaxies ( hickson 1982 ) . � is there any observational evidence that galaxies in compact groups are merging ? by 1982 it was evident that first - ranked galaxies in compact groups did not appear to be merger products , because the fraction of should have bluer colors than normal . � examining the hcgs , they found only a small enhancement in the fraction of early - type galaxies having blue colors , a conclusion reinforced by an independent study by moles et al ( 1994 ) . on � the other hand , caon et al ( 1994 ) argued that the large effective radii of compact group elliptical galaxies is indicative of an origin by merging or accretion of companions . � zepf ( 1993 ) estimated that roughly 7% of the galaxies in compact groups are in the process of merging . � this conclusion was based on roughly consistent frequencies of _ ( a ) _ optical signatures of merging , _ � ( b ) _ warm far - infrared colors , and _ � ( c ) _ sinusoidal rotation curves . � however , few galaxies show all of these effects simultaneously � . the merging fraction may thus be as high as 25% if one allows that any one of these criteria would be considered to be sufficient to indicate a merger ( hickson 1997 ) . � it seems safe to conclude that the fraction of merging galaxies is highly uncertain at present . � it seems safe to conclude that current observations do not rule out a significant amount of merging in compact et al 1995 ) in which we find strong gravitational interactions . at the other end \u001c are lower density compact groups , such as hcg 44 , which most likely are in a less - advanced stage of evolution .  embodiments this picture is supported by radio observations : seyfert s sextet and hcg 31 are both embedded in extended hi clouds whereas in hcg 44 the hi is associated with individual galaxies ( williams et al 1991 ) .  embodiments it seems clear that the groups as we now see them can persist for only a fraction of a hubble time .  embodiments it seems clear that merging should destroy the group on a time scale @xmath54 that is typically an order of magnitude larger than @xmath55 , depending on the distribution of dark matter ( cavaliere et al 1983 , barnes 1984 , navarro et al 1987 , kodaira et al 1990 ) and initial conditions ( governato et al 1991 ) . assuming that the groups are in fact bound dynamical systems  embodiments it can draw two conclusions : _ ( a ) _ there must be an ongoing mechanism for forming or replacing compact groups , and _ ( b )  embodiments _ there must be a significant population of relics of merged groups . dispersion found in present - day elliptical galaxies .     if compact groups have lifetimes on the order of @xmath54 , and form continuously , then the number of relics , per observed group , is expected to be on the order of @xmath56 .     if all hcgs are real , and thus , the number of relics could exceed that of present day groups by as much as an order of magnitude .     mamon ( 1986 ) estimated that , if all hcgs are real , then the relics would account for about 25% of luminous field elliptical galaxies . as we have seen , the true space density of compact groups is uncertain by at least a factor of two , and may be underestimated because of selection biases .     if all hcgs are real , then there is then the potential problem of producing too many relics .      a second problem is the fact that the integrated luminosities of compact groups are typically a factor of three to four times greater than luminosities of isolated elliptical galaxies ( sulentic and rabaa 1994 ) .    it is possible that interaction - induced star formation has boosted the luminosities of some compact - the hcg catalog includes several examples of compact groups containing both starburst galaxies and agn . most present - day compact group galaxies . the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath59 . � compact groups may possibly play a role in the formation of other systems . � we have seen that giant galaxies may be formed as the end product of compact - group evolution . at the other end of the scale , � dwarf galaxies have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a unique formation mechanism . � one possibility is that they form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris ( duc & mirabel 1994 ) . � if this is the case , one would expect to find evidence for this in compact groups of galaxies . � from an examination of condensations in tidal tails , hunsberger et al ( 1996 ) concluded that the fraction of dwarf galaxies produced within tidal debris in compact groups is not negligible . � there is also evidence that star clusters form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris ( duc & mirabel 1994 ) . � longo et al ( 1995 ) have found an excess population of unresolved blue objects around hcg 90 which appear to be recently formed star clusters . � these may be similar systems 5 - 10 times more distant should produce a non - negligible fraction of giant arcs .     studies of small groups may provide clues to the overall structure of the universe .     the baryon fractions found in clusters of galaxies appear to be inconsistent with a density parameter @xmath60 , unless the dark matter is more prevalent outside clusters ( white 1992 , babul & katz 1993 ) .    the baryon fractions found in compact groups provide a means to study dark matter in such regions .     the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .    the baryon fractions found for compact groups do appear to be lower than those for clusters .     david et al ( 1995 ) argued that the gas is the most extended component ; galaxies being the most compact and the dark matter being intermediate .     they concluded that the baryon fraction approaches 30% on large enough scales , which is comparable to the values found for clusters .     they concluded that given the constraints of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis this would imply that the density parameter @xmath61 is at most 0.2 . of galaxies . � the densest are generally in an advanced stage of evolution characterized by strong interactions , starburst and agn activity , stripping of stellar and dark matter halos , and merging . � they contain large amounts of dark matter and primordial x - ray - emitting gas trapped within the gravitational potential well .    despite this progress � , many questions remain unanswered . � what are the end products of compact group evolution , and do they have properties consistent with any know population of objects ? what is the space density of such relics ? � where do compact groups fit in the overall clustering hierarchy ? � what is their role in the evolution of galaxies both past and present ? given the current interest and research activity in this area , it is likely that many of these questions may soon be addressed . � it is a pleasure to thank the observatories of brera and capodimonte for hospitality during the initial work on this review . � i have benefitted from discussions with many individuals , but i would like to acknowledge particularly the contributions of a iovino , e kindl , g longo , g mamon , c mendes de oliveira , tk menon , g palumbo , h rood , exting _ astrofizika _ 61:25 -

      "generated": "is the most broad - ranging currently active field of applied probability ?     if you are measuring breadth by the number of different academic disciplines where it appears , it seems hard to beat a field appearing in physics , computer science and electrical engineering , economics and finance , psychology and sociology , population genetics and epidemiology and ecology .     curiously , the field has no good name , though readers of _ bernoulli _ will most likely know it , under the continuing influence of liggett s 1985 book  @xcite , as _ interacting particle systems_. it turns out that mathematically similar toy models of different real - world entities have been repeatedly re - invented in the different disciplines mentioned above , and literally thousands of papers have been written since 2000 on discipline - dependent variant models intended as more realistic .    rather than attempting a brief overview of the whole field as it stands today ( on which i am certainly not an expert ) , let me take an opposite approach , imagining starting with a blank slate .    i will set out in the next section a particular conceptual setting  @xcite , and then indicate what sorts of things are we trying to model ?  then a particular technical setup , and then indicate what sort of mathematical results people meet or communicate , and  they may explicitly or implicitly receive information from the other , and this interaction may change the `` state '' ( opinion or possessions or  ) of the individuals . * each unordered pair @xmath4 of agents with @xmath5 meets at the times of a rate-@xmath0 poisson process , independent for different pairs .   * we call this collection of poisson processes the _ meeting process_. where needed we write @xmath6 for the set of agents .    * we now introduce a set @xmath7 of states , and consider a process @xmath8 in which each agent @xmath9 is in some state @xmath10 at time @xmath11 , and the state can only change when agent @xmath9 meets some other agent @xmath12 , at which time the two agents states are updated according to some rule ( typically deterministic , but might be random ) which depends only on the pre - meeting states @xmath13 . mention three that are relevant to our models later .    the conceptually closest is the mathematical modeling of epidemics , whose long history is indicated by the 1957 monograph  @xcite .    a typical classical model like the sir ( susceptible  infected  recovered ) model corresponds to a 3-state fmie if the relevant distributions are exponential .    here of course the vertices are people or animals and the edges relate to physical proximity .    the classical models considered homogeneously mixing populations ( i.e. , the complete graph geometry ) but there is extensive post-2000 literature on more general geometries .    a quite different context , from theoretical computer science , concerns distributed randomized algorithms .    the most commonly used randomized algorithms are processors , communicating with nearby ( direct connections in a network ) processors , and performing computations based on data transferred .    we see  @xcite for the particular topic of _ gossip algorithms_.    what are called _ interacting particle systems ( ips ) _ arose historically as statistical physics models of phenomena such as magnetism , and mathematicians became interested in particular in rigorous study of phase transitions , in the setting of infinite geometries , specifically the infinite explicit definition . � for instance liggett  @xcite takes as examples the voter model , contact process , exclusion process , glauber dynamics for the ising model , and the potlatch process . � our mathematical setup of _ fmie process _ in section  [ sec : tech ] is intended as a more precisely circumscribed class of processes to study . � for instance , only the first three processes on liggett s list are fmie ( for the contact process , add an artificial agent with rate - one meetings with each other agent , to effect recovery ) . � what we call the meeting process is often called the _ graphical representation _ in ips . � our emphasis on a _ finite _ number of agents gives a somewhat different perspective than in classical ips , in which the finite setting was considered only occasionally , e.g. ,  @xcite . � our viewpoint is by analogy with the modern literature on mixing and hitting times for finite markov chains @xcite ; study how the behavior of a model depends on the underlying geometry , where `` behavior '' means quantitative aspects of finite - time behavior . � our emphasis on a _ finite _ number of agents gives a somewhat different perspective than in classical various `` general principles '' but these are rather trite , once said ) . at a pragmatic level , if seeking analytic results one chooses an update function such that the fmie process can be analyzed on the complete graph ( `` mean - field '' , roughly ) geometry , otherwise it will likely be difficult to handle other geometries . and not satisfy ( [ standardization ] ) and instead the default convention is to take rates @xmath27 for each edge @xmath28 .    for example, here one starts with the @xmath18-dimensional discrete torus ( or similar non - random graph ) and then adds random other edges in some specified way , for instance independently with probabilities proportional to @xmath29 .     for example, there are several ways ( in particular the _ configuration model _     , the monographs @xcite ) to define graphs corresponding to the intuitive notion of being `` completely random '' subject to the constraint that , as @xmath19 , the distribution of vertex - degrees converges to a prescribed distribution .     for example, there is no way to determine whether such models are tractable because their @xmath19 local weak limit is just a modified galton - watson tree .     for example, there is a huge `` complex networks '' literature ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite ) devoted to inventing and studying network models , and i will not write out a long list here . let me instead mention three other mathematically natural geometries which have _ chain theory .     here we discuss two fmie processes that are `` basic '' in two senses .     they fit the definition of fmie process but are much simpler than ( and therefore unrepresentative of ) a typical fmie process ; yet many other fmie processes can be regarded as being built over one of these base processes , with extra structure added .    for each fmie ization , we give only a verbal description , which the reader can readily formalize .    for each fmie ization , we give only a verbal description , which the reader can readily formalize .     for each fmie ization , we give only a verbal description , which the reader can readily formalize .      for each fmie ization , we give only a verbal description , we give only a verbal description , which the reader can readily formalize .     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this can evidently be viewed as a 2-state fmie process .     for readers more familiar with discrete - time chains , the natural aspect to study is @xmath32 the agent holding the token at time @xmath11 .     for readers more familiar with discrete - time chains , this @xmath33 is the ( continuous - time ) markov chain with transition rates @xmath2 .     for readers more familiar with discrete - time chains , we call this the _ associated _ markov chain  associated with the underlying geometry .     for readers more familiar with discrete - time chains , let me digress to mention , by analogy , a nuance . a google scholar search on `` exact phrase @xmath34 galton - watson ;

empty cluster as a particle , the particles move as the associated markov chain at half - speed ( rates @xmath61 ) , moving independently until two particles meet and thereby coalesce .      for fixed @xmath9 , note this factor @xmath60 in this section .    for fixed at time @xmath11 .      almost all of the literature on the finite voter model has focussed on estimating @xmath109 in terms of the geometry , and i will show some of this work in sections  [ sec : vmcg][sec : king2 ] .     this is the first question one can ask about the finite - time behavior , but there are other questions one can ask about the finite - time behavior , to be mentioned in section  [ sec : pre - asy ] .        there are two ways to analyze @xmath114 on the complete graph , both providing some bounds on other geometries .     the first uses coalescing chains .    this is one aspect of * kingman s coalescent *  @xcite is the continuous -

time maximized by @xmath129 , and @xmath130    now we can couple the original voter model ( @xmath1 different initial opinions ) with the variant with only 2 opinions , initially held by @xmath131 and @xmath132 agents .    now we can couple the original voter model ( just randomly assign these two opinions , initially . ) from this coupling , we see @xmath133 where the fraction is the chance that two specified agents are assigned different opinions , initially .    now we can couple the original voter model ( [ voter - kn ] ) with the variant with only 2 opinions , initially .    now we can couple the original voter model ( [ voter - kn ] ) with the variant with only 2 opinions , initially .   now we can couple the original voter model ( [ voter -

which was limited to three systems available in the first data release ( dr1 ) of sdss . � this unavoidably adds an extra source of uncertainty to all cmd fitting results . � is one of the main motivations for the various tests that are described in this paper is to see whether reasonable results can be obtained using the current @xcite isochrones . � we use match for slightly different purposes than originally described by @xcite ; the new `` modes '' are described briefly below . � while in the standard mode of match was originally developed to solve for the sfh and amr of a stellar system for which all stars can be assumed to be at the same distance , such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies . in this original mode of match the distance and the foreground extinction to all stars � are fixed a priori for each fit . from a set of age bins and metallicity bins , the combination that best fits the observed cmd � is found , resulting in an estimate of the sfh and amr . by doing the same fit with different values of the foreground extinction and distance , � differing distances     simultaneously we have implemented a new way in which to run match that keeps the same number of free parameters , or parameter dimensions , to be explored .     while in the standard mode the distance is fixed and age and metallicity are independent variables , here the distance becomes a free parameter , but age and metallicity are being limited via a specified age metallicity relation ( amr ) . for any given amr     there is only one `` population parameter '' , e.g. age with a certain metallicity linked to each age bin .     of course , different age - metallicity relations can be explored , potentially covering a wide range of possibilities .     it seems sensible to choose an amr that is appropriate for the studied stellar population on astrophysical grounds , such as the expected or known metallicity evolution .     for example , for the study of structures in the galactic thin disk one would consider a different amr than for the study of a metal - poor dwarf galaxy .     however , within this new mode of running match the choice of amr is completely flexible and a flat amr ( no dependence of metallicity on age ) or even an amr where metallicity decreases with time match mode of sections [ subsec : sfhamr ] and [ subsec : distsol ] can no longer be constrained by the data alone . to test a more restricted set of hypotheses in the case of low s / n systems we have developped a single component ( sc ) fitting mode for match . in this mode , template \u001c stellar population models are created that consist of a single component with given , fixed distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range . such a sc template is fit to the data together with a control field . \u001c since the template consists of a single component , the only free parameters during the fit are the absolute scaling of ( i.e. the number of stars in ) the template and the control field . \u001c for each individual sc ( i.e. for each combination of distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range ) , a value of the goodness - of - fit is obtained . comparing the goodness - of - fit values for all the sc s we \u001c can then find the best - fitting templates and thus constrain the overall properties of the system . \u001c the quality of each fit is expressed by the goodness - of - fit parameter q , determined using the maximum all fits with a value of @xmath7 less than 1 @xmath8 away from that of the best - fit sc model can be considered statistically acceptable , under the assumption that the best fit is a reasonable representation of the data . taking all these fits together , error estimates on the fit parameters can be determined from the encountered spread of the parameter values .           this approach of using relative values of @xmath7 should only be used in cases where the `` best fit '' is a reasonable approximation of the data . in cases where there are several very different prominent stellar populations this for a range of models the presence of a stellar over - density can be assessed by looking at the difference in the fit quality parameter , @xmath9 , between the control cmd fit and the control cmd plus model fit .    moreover , by comparing the values of @xmath9 for different models , a rough estimate of the properties of the overdensity can be obtained at the same time .    an important prerequisite for this method is of course that the over - density should contribute a larger fraction of the total number of stars to the target cmd than to the control cmd , and ideally should be contained completely within the target patch .    this means that over - densities will be detected with the highest s /   n if their size matches the size of the target patch .    this means that the over - densities will be detected with the highest s /  n if their size matches the size of the target patch .    this means that over - densities will be detected with the highest s /  n if their size matches the size of the target patch .    cccc 1 & 1013 & @xmath101.5

the same , to make for a fair comparison .   the artificial cmds 1 and 3 contain a simple , single burst stellar population , located at different distances , so that either the ms and msto or the rgb and hb are prominent features .   the artificial cmds 2 and 4 contain two different age and metallicity populations , again with the cmds corresponding to different distances .    the detailed parameters of the artificial populations are listed in table [ tab : fakegcprops ] . from the sdss archives all stellar sources in a 5@xmath115   patch of sky close to the globular cluster m13   were extracted and a small fraction used to create the field star contamination in these cmds .   the remaining sources will be used as a `` control field '' population when fitting these background contaminated cmds .   we recover the sfhs of the artificial cmds by running match with nine age bins and twelve metallicity bins .   the age bins are defined in partial cmds \u001c . the best fitting linear combination of model cmds will form the resulting sfh and metallicity evolution . to get a sense of the uncertainties on the sfh , each cmd is fit thrice , each time with a slightly different assumed distance .    for the sfh fits described above , the distance moduli used are 14.3 , 14.4 and 14.5 mag .    for the sfhs , the resulting sfhs and metallicities are presented in figure [ fig : fakesfhamr ] as the relative star formation rate ( sfr ) and as [ fe / h ] as function of the age of the stars .    for the sc \u001c fits models are created for a grid of parameters with a distance modulus range of 2.0 with 0.1 magnitude intervals centered on the the actual distance modulus ( table [ tab : fakegcprops ] ) .    for the sfhs , the ages used run from 9.0 to 10.2 in log @xmath12 with bin widths of 0.1 dex and metallicities go from [ fe / h]@xmath132.1 to 0.0 in steps cmds are used in these fits .  embodiments the fits are done at three different values of the metallicity : [ fe / h]@xmath131.6 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.4 to probe the uncertainties .  embodiments figure [ fig : fakesfhdist ] shows the resulting sfhs in relative sfrs and distance determinations .  embodiments the sfhs in figures [ fig : fakesfhamr ] and [ fig : fakesfhdist ] show that the software succesfully recovers the single burst in cmds 1 and 2 , and the two distinct episodes of star formation in cmds 3 and 4 .  embodiments some bleeding of star formation in adjacent bins will occur even when the fitted age bins exactly match the input sfh @xcite .  embodiments therefore it is to be expected that this also happens here , since the duration of the input star forming episodes do not match any age bins perfectly .  embodiments it should be noted that the error bars in the sfhs represent the error bars in the sfhs represent the range of sfrs encountered in each age bin within the three fits on which the sfhs are based , which means that ] and [ fig : fakesfhdist ] agree well with the input values . \u001c turning to the sc fits in figure [ fig : fakescfit ] , we see that for cmds 1 and 3 , the input properties ( indicated by stars ) are recovered very well . because there is a degeneracy between distance , age and metallicity \u001c when only the ms and msto are seen , the properties of cmd 1 are , however , constrained more poorly than for cmd 3 . \u001c since the sc fits use a single model population , the results for cmds with multiple populations , such as cmds 2 and 4 , can not be expected to properly recover the properties of all stars . \u001c rather , the population representing the majority of stars in the cmd will have the strongest weight . \u001c this is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 4 , that recover the properties of the older population , that dominates the star counts in the rgb and hb . for cmd 2 , \u001c this is clearly visible in the sc fits in figure [ fig : fakescfit ] , that recover the properties of the older population , that dominates the star counts in the rgb and hb . for cmd 2 , \u001c this shows 5@xmath15 & 14.38 , 14.43 & @xmath101.54 & 12@xmath15 & 0.019 + m 15 & 10.3 , 10.0@xmath16 & 15.37 ,

should be noted that in the cases of m15 , m92 and ngc 2419 these fields were not completely covered by the dr5 footprint .    the sdss flags were used to exclude objects with poor photometry and all stars were individually corrected for foreground extinction using the correction factors provided by dr5 and based on the maps by @xcite .    the sdss flags were used to exclude objects with poor photometry and all stars were individually corrected for foreground extinction using the correction factors provided by dr5 and based on the maps by @xcite .     any contamination of the samples of stars obtained by misclassified galaxies or other contaminants do not pose problems for our analysis because of the use of control fields that should contain the same populations of these contaminants .    the `` control field '' cmds were constructed from all stars outside a radius of 0.5   from the center of each gc .    the `` target fields '' were constructed by selecting stars within a certain radius from the center .    the radii used for m13 , m15 , m92 , table [ tab : gcproperties ] ; the mean reddening @xmath24 in magnitudes according to the @xcite maps in the target area for each gc is also listed in the table .    the gcs in the three top panels in figure [ fig : gccmds ] have metallicities of around [ fe / h]@xmath25 dex , and the gcs in the lower panels are more metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) . for the more nearby systems ( m13 , m15 , m92 and ngc 6229 ) the main cmd features that will drive the fits are the main sequence ( ms ) and main sequence turn off ( msto ) ; for the more distant systems ( ngc 2419 and pal 14 ) only the red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) are observed .    pal 14 in particular represents the case of a very sparsely populated system with high contamination from field stars .    in the following subsections ,    we discuss the results of applying match to these gcs in the four different modes described in section [ sec : modes ] . in fitting the cmds of these objects    we will sfh and amr of the clusters we run match fits with nine age bins and twelve metallicity bins . � because the isochrones are spaced more evenly in log @xmath12 than in @xmath12 , the age bins are defined to have equal width in log @xmath12 , with the oldest running from 10.0 to 10.2 ( 10 gyr to 15.8 gyr ) and the youngest from 8.6 to 8.8 ( 400 myr to 630 myr ) . � the metallicity bins cover the range from [ fe / h]@xmath132.4 to 0.0 in twelve bins of 0.2 dex width . � together with the control cmd this yields 109 model cmds for each gc . the fitting software then finds the linear combination of these model cmds that best fits the observed cmd . � looking at the results of these fits we find that each object is fit several times with slightly different fixed distances to determine the impact of distance errors on the recovered solutions . in the cases of m15 and ngc 2419 , where values from the literature for the distance modulus are quite discrepant � , we run fits for distance moduli of 15 by the fits at the different distances , with the error bars showing the complete range of sfr values found .    the metallicity in a bin is the average of the fits weighted by the sfr , and the error bars correspond to the standard deviation .     looking at the three intermediate metallicity gcs in the top half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] we see that in all cases match infers a purely old ( @xmath307 gyr ) population , as expected . for m13 and ngc 6229  we see that practically all stars are found to be older than 10 gyrs ; some bleeding into the second oldest age bin is always likely to occur , cf .    looking at the three metal - poor clusters in the bottom half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] with the three metal - poor clusters , we see that in the case of m13 and ngc 6229  we see that practically all stars are found to be older than 10 gyrs ; some bleeding into the second oldest age bin is always likely to occur , cf .    turning to the top half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] with the three metal - poor clusters , we rones , causing the code to fit them as a younger turn - off .    this demonstrates that cmd fitting results always need to be looked at in detail in order to understand their implications .    this demonstrates that the age distribution in ngc 2419 is not very well constrained because no msto is present in the cmd .     this demonstrates that the metallicities of m15 and m92 are recovered well for the old stars . while the estimated metallicity of @xmath101.9 for ngc 2419 is on the high side , for these metal - poor gcs the recovered metallicities are within 0.2 dex of the literature values .     this demonstrates that, as described in section [ subsec : scfit ] above , in the single component ( sc ) fitting mode an individual model cmd is fit to the data together with the control cmd , rather than a whole set of models .     this demonstrates that the cmd fitting results are very well constrained and that the results therefore provide information on the characteristic properties of the dominant stellar population in the cmd .     we sample the 3d parameter space of distance , age and metallicity by using one of nine age bins , one dex and a width of 0.2 dex .    after matching each of the 4347 sc options to each gc and determining the expected variance in the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath7 � , we take the best fit as our measurement and compare the other fits with respect to these best values . the resulting likelihood contour plots for metallicity , � distance and age measurements are shown in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] . � note that in these contour plots , the third parameter is unconstrained , rather than fixed at its known value . � if the third parameter would be kept fixed , the contours would shrink significantly . � in general the agreement with the literature values ( indicated with asterisks in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] ) is very good . the small offset for m13 is most likely due to inaccuracies in the isochrones , which illustrates the added uncertainty in cmd fitting results that depend on a single set of theoretical isochrones . � our distance modulus measurement from the sc fits for m15 lies exactly in between the two literature values , while for ngc 2419 our results clearly favor the smaller distance value from @xcite . from the two populations . in most cases � we used the literature parameters for these models , except for m15 , where we chose a distance modulus of 15.2 , the mean of the two different available values . for ngc 6229 and ngc 2419 � we use the literature metallicities and distance moduli that best correspond to our results . � we use the literature metallicities and distance moduli that best correspond to our results . � the agreement of model and data is generally acceptable , although inaccuracies , especially in the sub - giant branch , can be seen in m13 and m15 . � important to note is the influence of the degeneracies between age , distance , and metallicity . � for the nearby systems , m13 , m15 and m92 , where the fit is driven by the ms , there is a clear distance - metallicity covariance ; the left - most panels in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] show that the distance estimate increases with increasing metallicity . for the distant gc pal 14 , where the fit is driven by the rgb , � the covariance is the other way around . � another important , yet not wholly surprising , point is that higher s / n as a test case . for fitting the gcs it seems reasonable to use the same metallicity in all age bins .    we use the same nine age bins as in section [ subsec : gcsfh ] . in distance space \u001c we use a distance modulus range of three magnitudes centered on the known distance of each system with a resolution of 0.1 magnitudes , giving a total of 31 distance bins . for each \u001c gc we carry out three fits with different metallicities , centered on the literature values ( see table [ tab : gcproperties ] ) with offsets of 0.1 dex . for ngc 6229 \u001c we assume the lower metallicity value [ fe / h]@xmath131.43 , which is favored by our sfh and single component fitting results .    in figure \u001c [ fig : gcsfh ] and [ fig : gcdfit ] we present the age - distance distributions that result from these fits . compared to the fits in section [ subsec : gcsfh ] the number of free parameters per fit is the same , with now metallicity fixed instead of distance .    in figure \u001c [ fig : g .  Unfortunately, the extension of the sfh of pal 14 to more recent times has large uncertainties and is not significant .  However, it should be taken into account that the exact age of this system is difficult to constrain with sdss data , since the msto is not present . 229 ] . ============ we run distance solution fits to these cmds in the same way as before , with the same age bins , but now using a larger distance modulus range , from 12.0 to 19.0 magnitudes with a resolution of 0.2 magnitudes . ============ the three fits are run , for uniform metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath131.4 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.6 . ============ we include also a control cmd in the fit which is the control cmd of m 13 ; since m 13 and ngc 6229 are only 10 degrees apart and at similar galactic latitudes , this gives good results . ============ the averaged best - fitting distributions of stars over the grid of age and distance bins are shown in panels d ) , e ) and f ) of figure [ fig : m13ngc6229 ] . ============ both ages and distances of the two populations are recovered extremely well , with all stars in the oldest age bin ( @xmath3010 gyr ) , m13 stars centered at a distance modulus of 14.4 and ngc 6229 stars at a distance modulus of 17.4 . ============ the averaged best - fitting distributions Each gc has a 5@xmath115   field that was obtained from the sdss catalog server , with the central box centered on the gc .   the cmd of each box is fit with the control field cmd and with the control field plus a simple population model . for each � gc we use a model with the appropriate distance , age and metallicity . � figure [ fig : gcareas ] shows the difference in the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath7 between the two fits for areas around each gc . � note that for m15 and m92 , the 5@xmath115   field is not completely observed by sdss . � clearly , all gcs produce high peaks in @xmath9 . since @xmath9 is roughly proportional to the number of stars attributed to the population model in the model fit , the objects with the largest numbers of stars produce the strongest detections . only in the plot for pal 14 � does the vertical scale allow the random variations in @xmath9 to be visible in the area around the object . � the s / n of these detections should be measured with respect to this random noise . � using the 216 boxes around In recent years, the importance of deep wide - field surveys for the study of the stellar components of the milky way galaxy has been demonstrated by 2mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) and the sdss . � specifically , the sdss has enabled a detailed picture of the galactic stellar halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) and led to the discovery of at least fourteen previously unknown dwarf galaxies and globulars : ( umai , * ? ? ? � * ) , ( wil1 , * ? ? ? � * ) , ( cvni , * ? ? ? � * ) , ( booi , * ? ? ? � * ) , ( booi , * ? ? ? � * ) , ( umaii , * ? ? ? � * ) , , , , , fact raises intriguing questions .   For example, do these systems show that star formation can occur under conditions generally considered to be incapable of supporting such activity , or have these systems evolved to their current state through , for example , tidal interactions with the galaxy ?   For this reason, a thorough and systematic study of the properties of these objects is needed to understand their formation and evolution and the possible cosmological implications .   For this reason, several groups have been working on photometric and spectroscopic follow - up of the new mw companions in order to constrain their properties .  For this reason, a compilation of these results is given in table [ tab : newprops ] .   For this reason, although individual measurements of properties might be less precise in some cases , the advantage of studying these objects using the sdss photometry is that this highly uniform dataset allows a systematic approach to the complete set of objects and fair comparisons between them . in the following ,  we apply our single component ( sc ) fitting techniques to constrain the overall distances , metallicities and ages of the objects listed in table [ tab : newprops ] .

going star formation and has hi gas associated with it @xcite . because of the presence of two clearly very different populations the sc fitting method is not very well suited . � even when fitting the two populations separately , by dividing the cmd in two distinct parts as we have done , the results are poor , due to the small numbers of stars in each part . taking the results of the two populations together we find a distance modulus of 23.1@xmath330.6 magnitudes . both the old and young populations are best fit with low metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath51 - 1.5 . the star formation history we find ( figure [ fig : nssfh ] ) clearly shows two peaks , confirming the presence of two distinct populations . � the age of the old population , not well - constrained with the sc fits , is put in the 6.5 - 10 gyr age bin . comparing this with the sfhs of the gcs in figure [ fig : gcsfh ] and the other sfhs in figure [ fig : nss subsec : fakegc ] and the gcs m13 , m15 and m92 , where the sc fits also solely rely on the ms and msto \u001c , strong degeneracies between age , distance and metallicity are expected . indeed , the contour plots for seg 1 in figure [ fig : nsscfit2 ] show a similar morphology , but due to the sparseness of the cmd with even poorer constraints . ests ] for the gc ngc 6229 where also the msto drives the sc fit results . , since the sdss cmd does not support such detailed conclusions . however , taking our sfh fit and these other results together it does seem likely that uma ii , like cvn i , is a system with a complex star formation history , which might also be ( part of ) the explanation for the discrepancy between the two available spectroscopic metallicity measurements .    _ @xmath132.4 at the metal - poor end . in light of this , � our photometric results agree remarkably well with the spectroscopic values . � our photometric results agree remarkably well with the spectroscopic values . � our photometric results agree remarkably well with the spectroscopic values . � still , care has to be taken when drawing conclusions from these metallicity estimates . � we can say at best that we find no indication for a corellation between metallicity and the luminosity of the objects , which is observed for brighter dwarf spheroidals ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � the mean age of the stars versus absolute magnitude is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : nssummary ] . for objects in which the sfh fits � the right panel showed evidence for two populations , both populations are plotted separately . � the right panel shows the inferred ages of the satellites versus distance modulus , to probe possible environmental influences . � looking at the middle panel of figure [ fig : nssummary ] there is no clear evidence for a luminosity dependence of the ability of a dwarf galaxy to form since most of these recently detected objects are intrinsically faint and/or distant , they are of course much harder to detect by any overdensity detection scheme than the gcs .      the improvement in the goodness - of - fit , @xmath41 , between a fit with a control field only and a control field plus sc model is roughly proportional to the number of stars in the cmd that can be fit by the sc model .     this means that the objects with sparsely populated cmds are the most difficult to detect . comparing the overdensity detection results in figure [ fig : nsarea ] with the cmds of the objects ( figure [ fig : nscmds ] )     the rms noise in @xmath41 gives by far the highest @xmath41 .     the rms noise in @xmath41 increases with increasing numbers of field stars in the cmds , and at the low s / n end the noise level starts to play an important role .     the rms noise in @xmath41 increases with increasing numbers of field stars in the cmds , and at the low s / n end the noise level starts to play an important role . .    when inspecting the values in table [ tab : detsig ] , it turns out that the use of a fine - tuned population model as compared to the generic old , metal - poor model has a varied effect . in some cases the detection significance \u001c is improved , in some cases the change has little effect and in a few cases the detectability is actually decreased . in these last cases , even though the peak @xmath41 is the same to or higher for the fine - tuned model , the change in the rms causes the detection to become less significant .     when inspecting the values in table [ tab : detsig ] , it turns out that , while sampling a range of population models would be preferable when doing an overdensity search , a relatively small grid of models will not severely compromise the outcome .    to test the significance of the @xmath42 measure , we tested the overdensity detection scheme on a presumably ` empty ' patch of sdss sky with 170@xmath56ra@xmath56200and 40@xmath56dec@xmath5665 .     this patch of sky was divided into 20@xmath1120   boxes with some overlap , giving a the rms is obtained from the boxes in the surounding 5@xmath115 .  embodiments the methodology closely resembles the approach used for the mw satellites .  embodiments figure [ fig : pksig ] shows the histogram of all @xmath42 values for all boxes ( solid line ) , as well as for two individual distance moduli , 18.0 ( dotted ) and 22.0 ( dashed ) mag .  embodiments all three histograms show the same distribution , implying that the noise behaves similarly for all distance moduli .  embodiments the tail of the distribution extends to @xmath57 .  embodiments an inspection of the locations with values higher than 7 reveals no obvious overdensities , implying that this tail is indeed caused by noise . in order to obtain a clean sample of stellar overdensity detections ,  embodiments a @xmath42 threshold of @xmath149 seems appropriate .  embodiments this means that when using a sufficiently sampled grid of population models and distances , all new mw satellites would be detected , with the exception of boo ii ( cf .  embodiments the results of the fits to boo i with different box sizes , listed in table [ tab : detsig ] ) .  embodiments the results of the fits to boo i central box does not change . � it is also interesting to note that here the noise is dominated by the sagittarius stream , which runs accross the lower left corner of the panels in figure [ fig : booiareas ] . � the significance of the detections in table [ tab : detsig ] can be boosted by decreasing the box sizes , especially for the objects with the smallest ( projected ) size . � we have shown that application of match @xcite to hess diagrams or cmds of sdss data successfully recovers the known stellar population properties of globular clusters ( section [ sec : gctests ] ) , within the limitations of the data . � this gives confidence that despite inaccuracies in the theoretical isochrones in isolated parts of the cmd , the overall cmd - fitting technique still provides good and trustworthy results . � apart from the standard star formation history fitting method , we have also demonstrated three other ways of applying match to sdss data : + 1 ) identifying the best fitting ` single component ' stellar population , a mode useful for cmds of very faint or distant objects with limited s / � n in their cmd ; + 2 ) fitting the line - of - sight distribution of stars  to keep the yielding data over the next few years .     further improvements in software and theoretical isochrones can only increase the use and accuracy of such work . on the basis of these tests and the application to known globular clusters     , we have applied our single component fitting technique to twelve recently discovered milky way satellites .     the sparseness of several of the cmds of these objects inhibits a robust determination of the population parameters and the best fit solutions are often not unique . in order to obtain good constraints at least some cmd features such as the msto , hb and rgb     should be observed with sufficiently high s / n . for the least luminous objects     this is inherently problematic because of their lack of ( evolved ) stars . for only four of the satellites ,     the cmds had sufficiently high s / n to warrant a star formation history fit .     the results of the population fits to the new milky way satellites , summarized in table [ tab : newresults ] , are consistent with the individual discovery and follow - up studies . when looking at the sample as a whole , we find that the majority of these objects are likely dominated by old ( @xmath59 10 gyr ) and metal - poor ( [ fe cvn i to be old as well , but not extremely metal - poor . � however , the sfh reveals the presence of both an old , metal - poor , as well as a younger ( @xmath513 gyr ) and more metal - rich population . this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who detect two kinematically distinct populations in cvn i which differ in age and metallicity , and the detection of a young component by @xcite in deeper photometry . � however , the sfh of uma ii also shows a peak at an age of @xmath145 gyr , which supports suggestion of multiple populations in this object by @xcite , who find the msto width of uma ii to be too large to be explained by photometric errors alone . � finally , in leo t the presence of two distinct populations is readily seen in the cmd and reproduced in the star formation history . � the rgb seen in this system belongs most likely to an intermediate age ( @xmath145 -

dimm data collected at each site during each month of a year .  embodiments even though data collection was ongoing on several sites until mid 2008 , only the data obtained during the indicated periods were considered in the tmt site testing process and are presented in this work .  embodiments the site testing stations at cerro tolar , mauna kea 13n , spm and cerro tolonchar were dismantled in august 2007 , june 2008 , august 2008 , august 2008 and november 2008 , respectively . at some of these sites , mass - dimm data collection  embodiments had already been terminated before these dates .  embodiments the collected mass observations allow the computation of the characteristic turbulence profile above each individual layer tss are shown in tab .  embodiments [ profilestable ] . for completeness  embodiments that table also shows the mean and rms values for each layer .  embodiments these data represent the statistical properties of each individual layer , but these profiles can not be considered as realistic or representative . in particular because the layers will not be entirely independent from each other .  embodiments for example , for the lowest mass layers , which are spaced close to each other , one might expect that shearing forces could cause interaction between these layers .    the other way to define  embodiments a tp is to compute the ts of the layers under particular seeing , isoplanatic angle and coherence time conditions .  embodiments for example , we looked for the typical tp for the @xmath18%ile of the dimm seeing , which is inverse proportional to the median @xmath19 .  embodiments for example , we first identified @xmath20% of all dimm data with values closest to @xmath19 .  embodiments , we first identified @xmath20% of all dimm data with values closest to @xmath19 .  embodiments then , we compute the statistics of the mass data which were taken simultaneous with the selected dimm it must be noted that even though these profiles represent the typical vertical distribution of turbulence during the times when a certain value of an integrated turbulence parameter is observed , computing that parameter from these profiles does not result in the value of the respective percentile of that parameter computed from the overall data sample . � for example in the case of tolar , computing the total seeing from the median profile from mass data selected around the median dimm seeing results in 054 . � but the overall dimm seeing statistics results in a median seeing of 063 ( @xcite ) . � this is because in the first case the statistics is done before the exponent of @xmath11 is applied to the layer ts , whereas the median seeing is obtained after that step . � these turbulence profiles now allow to understand the differences in the integrated turbulence parameters between the sites ( @xcite ) . � the three sites in chile show a very similar vertical distribution of the ts . � it can be seen that when compared to the northern hemisphere sites , 13n on mauna kea and spm , the chilean sites show a weaker ground layer ts by approximately 50% . however , the ts above the chilean sites is stronger than the northern sites at alt are weighted equally , explaining the low mass seeing of spm . the ground up to 200  m. to obtain this profile , the xfas profile was integrated from 200  m to 500  m and added to the median mass seeing value during the time of observation . � this mass seeing is indicated by the markers to the right of the sodar profiles . � this 200  m xfas+mass seeing was then added to the sfas layers , resulting in the profiles shown in figure  [ sodarprofiles ] . � the profiles were first added and the median was calculated afterwards . � the observed dimm seeing taken simultaneously with the sodar observations is indicated by the markers to the left of the profiles , at 7.5  m above ground . � even though the sodar profiles start at 10  m above ground , the 10  m datapoint is an integral from 7.5  m to 12.5  m. and , as the sodars were always mounted approximately 1  m to 3  m below the bases of the 6.5  m tall telescope towers , it can be assumed that the sodars do not miss turbulence compared to the dimm . � the sodars were typically operated during much less time than the mass - dimm on the the only site where the agreement is worse is spm . � this can be attributed to the increased acoustic noise due to the trees surrounding the site , which affect the sodar measurements ( see @xcite for details ) . � it can also be seen in figure  [ sodarprofiles ] that the profiles obtained at the chilean sites are similar to each other . � their tps show that the bulk of the gl is located below 40  m and 60  m at tolonchar and armazones , respectively . in comparison , � the northern sites start from a weaker ts at higher altitudes , but below 100  m they increase much stronger than the chilean sites . between approximately 60  m and 90  m , their profiles are crossing the ts of the chilean sites .    from the presented turbulence profiles we conclude , � their tps show that the topography and surface properties of the sites dominate the optical ts over the lowest hundred meters above ground , which are the main drivers for the overall seeing . � the site at spm is surrounded by trees and we believe that the therefore increased surface roughness , heat capacity , and release of humidity , cause the enhanced ts ; this raises the an extension of approximately 500  m in north  south and 250  m in east  west direction and that some sparse vegetation is present . behaviour of the mass layers below approximately 4  km is anticorrelated with the mass layers at 8  km .    the ts of the 4  km and 16  km layer exhibit less pronounced seasonal variations at some sites , if any .    the 8  km mass layer ( @xmath28 10  km to 12  km a.s.l . ) at the sites falls closest to the altitude domain of the tropopause .    the lower mass layers thus trace the troposphere , whereas the 16  km mass layer ( @xmath28 18  km to 20  km a.s.l . )    the lower mass layers thus trace the troposphere , whereas the 16  km mass layer ( @xmath28 18  km to 20  km a.s.l . )    the lower mass layers thus trace the troposphere , whereas the 16  km mass layer rather traces the lower stratosphere . that the parts of the atmosphere below and above this altitude behave differently  is therefore not unexpected .    we will discuss these two altitude regimes separately .     first we discuss the chilean sites . above tolar    all layers up to 4  km detected in the atmosphere above northern chile .    at these low altitudes , local terrain effects will play an imporant role .     in the tropics , there are several factors that might influence the ts , like the proximity of tolar to the pacific ocean which acts as heat reservoir ; and tolonchar rising steeply out of its surrounding arid terrain , ranging already into the westerly winds which dominate at higher elevations ( @xcite ) .    in the tropics , not only the low altitude but also the large scale atmospheric conditions might be the driver of the ts .    in the tropics , the `` altiplano winter '' phenomenon is a result of the shift of the inner tropical convergence zone southwards over the amazonia region . over south america     in the tropics , this results in increased low altitude winds and convective , monsoon - like , activity ( @xcite , @xcite ) . during summer     the chilean sites are located within the region where the parts of these northerly winds which cross the andes and the anti - cyclonic southerlies meet and turn westwards off the pacific coast . a very low level ( few @xmath27  m@xmath29 ) .       these variations are opposite to what is observed in chile : strong ts in winter and weak ts during summer . at spm     the seasonal variation is not reaching into the 4  km mass layer , whereas 13n might show some faint seasonal trend of this layer .      interestingly , the behaviour of the 0.5  km layer does not correspond to the gl .     for example , during jja the 0.5  km layer becomes strongest at spm whereas its gl is weakest during these months .            both sites are not far to the pacific ocean and we expect it to play an important role in the ts . but their local terrain is quite complex ( vegetation at spm and 13n being not on the actual summit ) , not allowing an easy qualitative assessment of the ts behaviour . for the large scale flows it can be said that both sites are located in the flow of the hawaiian high which extends further south during the summer months . during the winter it shifts towards north and the north - westerly flow in the area of haw candidate sites ranging from 2.3 to 4.5  km asl  [ ncepcn2 ] , the 8  km mass layer traces the domain of the jetstream , whose typical altiude is around 200  mb ( corresponding to @xmath3111  km asl ) .

[ ncepcn2 ] is an influence of the jetstream activity , or more general of the wind speed , on the ts has been discussed since some time in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to see whether the wind speed is indeed one of the main drivers for the ts at these altitudes  [ ncepcn2 ] , we make use of the vertical wind speed profiles provided by the the ncep / ncar reanalysis project ( @xcite ) .  [ ncepcn2 ] , the used locations of the ncep models are given in table  [ ncepcoord ] .  [ ncepcn2 ] , the ncep wind speed profiles are provided every six hours and at 16 altitudes , however , with more scatter than armazones . in the case of tolonchar � this enhanced scatter is in part due to low statistics during certain months ( see above ) . � nevertheless , the slope ( increase of ts with wind speed , marked as parameter @xmath34 in fig .  [ ncepcn2 ] ) is at the same level at all three sites . on the other hand , above spm and � 13n the ts remains at very low levels up to @xmath35 m/s and only the higher wind speeds show a trend towards stronger @xmath36m@xmath8 values . � in other words , for the same level of wind speed , the turbulence strength at the northern sites is only about half of what is observed above chile . � also the rate of increase is only half of what is observed at the southern sites . � we tested similar correlations for the other mass layers but these do not show significant correlations . � this confirms the findings by @xcite who showed a direct correlation between the 200  mbar wind speed and the total seeing observed at telescopes on mauna kea and la silla . � also the rate of increase is only half of what is We did not observe any significant increase of ts , but our observations of the weaker increase of ts above the sites of 13n and spm are at first puzzling and are in contrast to the common threshold found in the @xcite data .    we believe that this could indicate that the mass misses to detect the jetstream above spm and 13n .    we did not observe any significant increase of ts above spm and spm , but as the mass calculates the total seeing from the integral of the reconstructed @xmath4 values and also from the total scintillation , it is possible to test the overall integration scheme of the mass system .     we found that both methods deliver values of the total seeing which agree to within 10% : the armazones median mass seeing from the scintillation calulation resulted in 040 , as compared to 043 from the @xmath0 reconstruction ( for 13n mauna kea the numbers read 030 and 034 , respectively ) .     we believe that this , in combination with the previously shown agreement with other instruments , demonstrates that no turbulence is acutally missed by the mass . on the other hand , the interpolated wind speed will certainly not be very , which rises steeply out of the sea , can be expected to show enhanced formation of atmospheric waves . � such waves can also be forced by differential heating patterns like the proximity of the atacama desert to the pacific ocean . � atmospheric waves are commonly thought to result in an increased ts . � unfortunately , such waves and their turbulence production can not yet be modeled properly , even though comparisons between models and observations show promising results ( e.g. , @xcite ) . � our results might indicate that it is the actual interaction between wave and jet stream which is driving the ts . � to investigate the typical behaviour of the ts during the night we computed , similar to the standard year , a standard night . � it consists of the median ts of all data collected during each hour after sunset . � figure  [ txcnnight ] shows the results for the sites . to avoid artefacts introduced by the seasonal variations of the times of sunrise and sunset , the graphs in figure  [ txcnnight ] represent the merged behaviour for the hourly medians computed with respect to sunset and sunrise . � we found that the curves computed with respect to sunrise and sunset match best when sunset is set to 5  hours . the ts in the high altitude layers remain close to constant throughout the night , whereas the lower layers show a decreasing ts with time .     in contrast , only 13n and tolar exhibit almost no change during the course of the night in the lower layers . at spm     in contrast , the air above the 0.5  km layers at this site shows a decrease of its ts until one two hours before sunrise .     the ts in the layers up to 2  km above armazones decrease during the first half of the night and then remain at almost constant values .     finally , the air above tolonchar shows a continuous drop of ts throught the night , which maybe only levels off in the 0.5  km layer .     the observed behaviour appears similar to a cooling process and the differences between the sites on how the ts evolves below the tropopause , are related to the evolution of wind shear and temperature gradients .     we do not have measurements in order to compute the richardson number or any other stability parameter in this altitude range .     nevertheless , we make the assumption that the temperature and wind speed measured at the sites are related to their respective gradients throughout the air above the site . similar to tolonchar , but at a lower level , is the behaviour at 13n and tolar .     we note that our wind speed measurements are unreliable at spm due to the site being surrounded by trees . by dust or ice in the mechanisms . � however , we found the two systems to agree very well during most of the time . � a particular case is tolonchar , where a strong gradient exists between the 2  m and 7  m level , due to the steep terrain drop towards the prevailing wind direction . � still , we show here only the aws anemometer data , as the sonic anemometers were installed only during the second half of the site testing program and thus do not cover the full time span of mass - dimm measurements . � the panels of figure  [ cn2vsws ] show the dependence of the tss of the individual mass layers on the wind speed . � the median @xmath4 value was computed in 1  m / s wind speed bins for wind speeds up to the operational limit of the site testing telescope . � this limit was typically 15  m / s , only the tolonchar setup was limited to 12  m / s due to the strong gradient mentioned before . � we expect that the measured wind speed at 2  m above ground is indicative of the wind speed within the lowest mass layers . for the higher layers this assumption � can not be expected to the sites . � the correlations break down at altitudes below the sites . � as was seen in the overall profiles , as well as in @xcite , the ground layer at all sites shows the strongest ts by up to a factor of a few . � this is not unexpected , as the mass - dimm defined ground layer covers ( most of ) the atmospheric boundary layer , i.e. , the layer in which turbulence production is dominated by the interaction between air and ground . � shearing forces are strong in this layer as the air speed at surface has to reach zero . also the ground might heat or cool the air above it by means of the sensible heat flux , introducing temperature gradients . � as was already shown in @xcite , the gl shows the lowest @xmath37 in the range of wind speeds between approximately 2  m / s and 8  m / s for the chilean sites and approximately 2  m / s and 3  m / s for 13n mauna kea . � spm shows a continuous increase of @xmath37 of the gl with increasing wind speed . � as that site is surrounded by trees the wind speed measurements , especially at low values , are doubtful � km layers remain at very low ts , but the 2  km layer rises up to 5  m / s and then shows a quite strong increase by @xmath38  m@xmath8 towards 7  m / s . � tolonchar is about 2000 m above the level of the salar de atacama ( a flat dry salt lake ) , which is in the prevailing wind direction and within 20  km from the mountain base . � these 20  km are smoothly sloped terrain ranging up 500m-800 m below the tolonchar summit . � therefore , one could assume that the wind reaching the summit effectively resembles an altitude of 1000 - 2000 m above the surface and the 0.5 and 1  km mass layers trace the free air flow between 2 and 3  km above the effective terrain . � tolar and armazones reach out similarly but not as high and steep as tolonchar . in the case of armazones a mountain range which is slightly higher ( 3400  m asl ) is located in the prevailing wind direction . � we speculate that these orographic features cause the onset of waves , driving the ts at these altitudes . � this picture seems reasonable also for the 13 indicates that its altitude brings it into the regime of the geostrophic westerly flows which are probably better modelled by ncep and are less dependent on the local orography and therefore the correlation is higher . seasonal and nocturnal variations of the median turbulence strength recorded by the mass have also been shown .    these data indicate that the resolution of the mass is in the order of a few @xmath27  m@xmath8 .    in the summer months, clear seasonal variations are observed up to 2  km and at 8  km above the sites .    in the winter months, the 4  km and 16  km layers show only little or no seasonal trends .    in the summer months, the 8  km mass layer turbulence strength was found to correlate well with the wind speeds at these altitudes above the chilean sites . as seasonal turbulence strengths of the 8  km and the lower mass layers     are basically anit correlated , it can be expected that ground layer adaptive optics will be most efficient during the summer months at all sites .    in the winter months, clear seasonal and nocturnal variations are typically confined to regions below the 4  km mass layer .    in the winter months, these trends seem to indicate that orographic features and surface energy properties on scales of tens of km are important drivers for the turbulence strength at altitudes below the trop of optical turbulence in earths atmosphere . . , seguel j. , tokovinin a. , kornilov v. , riddle r. , skidmore w. , travouillon t. , vogiatzis k. , blum

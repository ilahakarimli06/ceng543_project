odd higgs particle ( the sneutrino ) with non - zero vacuum expectation value . to test susy and gut , one has to measure the cp - violating observables . for susy models with susy at the weak scale , cp violation can be predicted by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) we propose a simple extension of the standard model based on @xmath0 gauge theory with two higgs doublets and a singlet scalar field .<n> the higgs field is coupled to the scalar field via a @xcite-like interaction , while the two doublet scalar fields couple to each other only through the exchange of a higgs boson with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) that is positive ( negative ) in the new gauge theory . in this model ,<n> the vevs of the two scalar fields do not commute , which leads to the absence of gauge invariance and the breakdown of the symmetries of the theory at the planck scale . as a result , the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking , and the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields are , in general , not consistent with the values implied by the radiative electroweak vacuum stability . <n> recently , we have proposed a simple model of gauge interactions in which the higs fields are coupled to all the fermions in the theory in a way that is consistent with all experimental constraints , including those coming from the low energy precision measurements of the we propose a simple extension of the standard model based on a @xmath0 gauge theory in which the gauge couplings are determined by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs and gauge boson fields .<n> we show that , in this model , the vev of the gauge bosons is proportional to the square of the vacuum energy density , a result which is in excellent agreement with the current experimental data . <n> the phenomenological implications of this model are briefly discussed . in the early universe ,<n> the universe is filled with a hot and dense plasma of @xcite ( the so - called  tev universe '' ) , whose dynamics is governed by the dynamics of the ( classical ) higgs field and the ( quantum ) gauge boson field , respectively . at the present time , both fields are in thermal equilibrium , and their respective higgs potentials are non - interacting . as a result , t - parity symmetry is spontaneously broken , giving rise to , among other things , ( 1 ) the existence of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , which is of the order of the planck scale ; ( 2 we present a calculation of the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 at midrapidity in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with gauge - mediated interactions .<n> we use a non - perturbative approach based on the resummation of soft gluon bremsstrahlung ( sgb ) terms . <n> the rapidity distribution ( rd ) of hadrons produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is a sensitive probe of the gluon distribution in the nucleon . in the non - relativistic limit ,<n> the rd is known to be given by the distribution of gluons produced in the initial stages of the collision @xcite . however , in the relativistic regime , where the number of participating nucleon - nucleon collisions is large , it is often assumed that the gluons are completely unobservable . as a result , their contribution to rd can not be determined . here<n> , we propose a method to estimate their contribution , based on _ direct _ measurements of their transverse momentum distributions in the final state , which we present in the form of an event -

defined characteristic pattern speed is apparent . <n> it is generally accepted that spiral density waves ( sdw s ) are spontaneously generated in spiral galaxies by the interaction of spiral arms and/or the interstellar medium ( ilr ) @xcite . to date<n> , no strong evidence has been found for the existence of sds , although there is some evidence for them in some early - type , low surface brightness galaxies . for spiral galaxies with two - armed spiral arms , it has been suggested that the density waves are amplified by swing motion of the arms . here<n> we report on the apparent pattern speeds of the spiral structures in 140 two - arm spiral galaxies over a seven - year period . using the structure of regular two - armed spiral galaxies in the large magellanic cloud was imaged in johnson @xmath0 for 30 minutes to a maximum contrast of @ xmath1 .<n> two classes of galaxies make up the observing list : physically large spiral and grand design spirals . because rotation curves of spirals are usually flat , physically large spirals have a good chance of having spiral structure so extensive that the cr is within the bright disk . <n> # 1to 0pt#1 the 50 largest spiral galaxies in the local universe were observed with the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( rc3 ) at @xmath0 resolution .<n> doppler velocities were obtained for 50 of the largest galaxies from several literature sources , and angular sizes were estimated for the remaining galaxies . <n> these galaxies are all spiral galaxies of morphological type  s '' or  sb '' ( inclusive ) . the largest sb - sc galaxies are on average larger than those of other hubble types , but they are not uniformly distributed ; there is a wide range of sizes among the largest sd , sb , sc , sbc , bc , dc , or elliptical galaxies , as well as between sb and sc . in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc )<n> , the largest scd galaxy has a lmc - like lmc scale radius of 3.25 kpc , which corresponds to a hubble constant of about 200 km s@xmath1 mpc@xcite . emission line mapping of sb - sc ( inclusive ) spirals is reported for @xmath0 km s@xmath1 .<n> the data are consistent with hubble type sb (  s '' ) to sc ( sd ) at a mean hubble rate of @xcite . <n> the grand design spiral structure of about half of the objects is clear and smooth , while the other half shows some variety , including grand design spirals with multiple - armed arms , flocculent spirals with bars , and spirals with  irregular '' or  non - regular '' spiral structure that is not clearly grand design in the emission line maps . in general , the grand - design spirals are rounder than the physically large sb spirals , so that they are less likely to have a bar , a bar - like feature that may be a signature of past interactions or mergers , or a central bar that has been completely destroyed . the flatrc ( _ flatrc _ for short ) shape of the spiral structure is consistent with a flat rotation curve , as is the distribution of the luminosities of the disks , suggesting that the disks are in virial equilibrium  the grand design spiral pattern of a galaxy may be characterized by three features : a bar , an inner ring , and an outer pseudoring .<n> the presence of a bar may be clear only when the galaxy has an s - shape : then it is not clear if the nearly straight central segment is a bar or merely the convergence of two open spiral arms on the nucleus . <n> inner rings may be round or pointy ( that is , lozenge - shaped ) . pseudorings are ring - like features that appear to be formed by spiral arms . a downhill simplex algorithm ( press et al . 1988 ) fitted ellipses to isophotes by minimizing the isophotal deviations around the ellipses ; inner pseudorings usually have a lozenge shape and are generally not closed . the distinction between an inner pseudoring and a pointy inner ring was not clear . if the ring segments were closed and the spiral arms were not obviously extensions of the segments , then the feature was called the inner ring. outer pseudorings have a fat dumbbell or figure - eight shape . the shapes of pseudorings and inner and outer spiral structure in disk galaxies are investigated .<n> pseudorings have a fat dumbbell or figure - eight shape in the outer disks . outer pseudorings , which have a pointy inner ring , are not clear . for this paper , if the spiral arms followed continuously from the ring segments , or if the ring segment did not close , then the feature was called a pseudoring . some galaxies show two patterns : they have faint spirals in their outer disks that is of a different character than the bright inner arms . surface photometry in the literature was used to calibrate the instrumental surface brightness profiles of some galaxies .<n> the effect of foreground stars on the measured profiles was reduced by ignoring the brightest 10% of the pixels in each radial zone . the mean surface brightness at the outer extent of the spiral structure was computed . <n> = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=0pt the study of spiral structure in galaxies is of fundamental importance for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies , as well as for the use of spiral galaxies as cosmological distance indicators . to date ,<n> spiral structure has been detected in only a few percent of nearby galaxies ( see elmegreen & elme green 1995 ) . in the local universe , however , the number of galaxies with spiral structure is estimated to be as high as @xmath0 , based on the number density of objects with detectable spiral structure ( see @xcite and the references therein )<n> . spiral structure may be a useful diagnostic of the distribution of dark matter in galaxies because it can be seen directly in the form of spiral arms , bars , and bulges . here<n> we report on the detection of spiral structures in a small sample of nearby spiral galaxies  we report the first high - resolution ( @xmath0 ) imaging study of the spiral structure of nearby , grand design , barred spiral galaxies .<n> the data were obtained with the hobby - eberly telescope at the u. s. naval observatory in baltimore , maryland , using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . for each galaxy ,<n> the grand design spiral structure was imaged in the johnson - kron - cousins ( jkd ) bands at a resolution of @xcite . in this paper<n> , we present high - quality , high signal - to - noise surface photometry of the optically luminous , outer spiral structures of a sample of seven barred , cd galaxies : ngc0521 , ic443 , ugc5236 , v404 sgr , and v5559 scorpii . <n> the goal of this study was to determine the outer extent of optically luminous spiral structure in these galaxies , in order to test whether they are truly grand design spirals , or the surface photometry in the @xmath0 band for a sample of galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is analyzed to study the optically luminous spiral structure .<n> the galaxies are divided into grand design spirals and barred spirals according to whether or not they have extended , continuous , two - armed spiral arms . for each galaxy<n> a surface photometric surface brightness map is created and the spiral structure is examined . the equation [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio ( the ratio of the surface brightness of the spiral component to that of the galaxy as a whole ) and the extent of extra or detached arms are measured and compared to spiral density wave theory . grand design spirals have low values of the equation [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio , @xmath0 , that are less than unity .<n> this is consistent with spiral density wave theory ( spiral structure bounded by the lindblad resonances ) and the fact that most rotation curves are approximately flat . effects due to the shape of the rotation curve ( [ sec_shape ] ) can explain the few ratios larger than unity<n> . theories of the creation of grand design spiral structure can explain this preponderance of low values . a distribution of values of the equation [ eq_ilrcr ] , which determines the ratio of the total mass of a galaxy to the mass of its dark matter halo , is derived for galaxies with a wide range of spiral and baryonic structures .<n> the distribution of the ratios is found to have a peak near 0.5 , where there is a large fraction of barred and ringed galaxies . in the peak region ,<n> there are distributions of the ratio for each of the morphological classes : pure spirals with no sign of a ring or bar , barred galaxies ( which may have a ring ) , and rings including galaxies with pseudorings . the distribution of the ratio of the main two - armed spiral pattern speed to the pattern speed in disk galaxies is investigated for a sample of barred and ringed spirals .<n> pure spirals are much more evenly distributed in the equation [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio than are those for barred or ringed galaxies , and their statistics are noisier than those for the other morphological classes . in a few cases where the uncertain morphology could move a galaxy from the barred to the ringed class , the galaxy is graphed on histograms for both possible classes as an unshaded box . galaxies with @xmath0 are selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and have been imaged in the b , r , and i bands .<n> the galaxies have been fitted with single - component , non - isothermal , srsic models in order to determine the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) , to study the effects of bars and resonances on the formation and evolution of galaxies . <n> the results are summarized as follows : (1 ) barred galaxies tend to have a strong bar ending inside their circular radius ( cr ) or just short of their cr ; ( 2 ) there is a correlation between limited spiral extent and the presence of a bar ; and ( 3 ) galaxies with a bar are resonantly related when they appear together in the same galaxy . in barred spirals ,<n> the bar ends inside the cr , but spiral structure extends only between the cr and the olr . for a barred spiral , the equation [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio for the cr to olr radius ratio is about 0.6 , if the spiral patterns have the same pattern speed as grand design spiral galaxies with the largest values of the resonance ratios between two - armed spiral arms are examined . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 a conservative test is used to assess the degree to which the spiral structure of a galaxy varies with radius .<n> the test is applied to a sample of nearby disk galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the f606w and f814w ( @xmath0 ) passbands . for acs point sources with a signal - to - noise greater than 5 ,<n> the conservative test requires that the ratio of the arm brightnesses in the inner and outer disks be less than or equal to unity . in order to pass the test , the galaxy must have a spiral structure that winds through a turn and a half , or else it must have some other unusual spiral pattern in its disk . <n> spiral arms in disk galaxies are a natural consequence of the galaxy formation process and are expected to form in two ways : ( 1 ) as a by - product of disk formation , and ( 2 ) by the gravitational influence of a central black hole on the formation of disk galaxies . to determine which of these two mechanisms dominates the disk spiral structure , it is necessary to determine the ratio between the brightnesses of the two arms in the disk , @ the conservative test of kinematics and resonances is applied to a sample of @xmath0 disk galaxies . <n> galaxies are divided into two classes according to whether or not they pass the test . in the first class ,  early - type '' galaxies , the spiral structure is very regular and winds through a turn and a turn .<n> the spiral arms are narrow , with inner tine radii of a few disk scale lengths , in contrast to other galaxies with different arm luminosities in the inner and outer disks . for later - type galaxies<n> , there is a wide range of morphologies and kinematics , indicating that resonances play an important role in the formation and evolution of spiral structure . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' this paper describes an observational project that examined 140 spiral galaxies , measuring the visual extent of their spiral structure . the purpose of the project was to find galaxies for which the corotation resonance of the two - armed grand design spiral structure was likely to be within the bright optical disk . i study the extent to which barred and ringed spirals in general have more limited spiral extent than pure spirals in order to test whether the location of inner rings at the inner 4:1 or corotation resonances and if the bar and spiral are part of the same pattern place constraints on spiral extent . <n> i find that pure spirals statistically have more restricted spiral extent ( relative to the axis ratio @xmath0 ) than barred spirals , but only by a factor of 2 or more .<n> this result can be explained if many bars end at their inner 4:1 resonance and if a bar and a spiral are both part of a single pattern . in pure spiral galaxies ,<n> the extents of bars and spirals are statistically the same , except in the vicinity of the inner lindblad resonances where they are significantly more limited . if the inner rings of bars are at the corotation or the 4:1 resonances , then the locations of outer rings at these resonances place no extra constraint on spiral length . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' bertin g. lin@xmath1 thurstans c. c. lowe s. a.  we present an analysis of the dynamics of a sample of barred , late - type galaxies , based on data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive .<n> the sample is divided into two groups , those with and without dust lanes , and is compared to a control sample of non - barred galaxies of similar velocity dispersions . <n> we find that barred galaxies with @xmath0 km s@xmath1 have a velocity dispersion distribution with a mean dispersion of @xcite = 392 km . the mean velocity dispersion of the control sample , @x 388 , is @x a factor of two lower . at a mean inclination angle of 60<n> , the velocity dispersion is in the range , 100 - 200 , which is significantly lower than that of the baiesi - pillast ( 1981 ) and bertin - thurstans - lowe ( 1989a ) samples , but similar to that of ngc 2808 . for @x<n> 100 , there is no difference in the dispersion between the two samples . however ,<n> if we restrict the sample to galaxies with velocity dispersion we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the central @xmath0kpc of the archetypical barred spiral galaxy ngc 4395 .<n> we find a redshift of @xcite for the galaxy , and a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath1 . <n> this is the most metal - poor galaxy yet known to have a seyfert 2 nucleus , which is typical of barred spiral galaxies . in the past few years<n> there has been increasing interest in studying the properties of a small sample of barred galaxies , as these are believed to be dominated by the interstellar medium ( ism ) of early - type , low - metallicity , dwarf spheroidals . despite the large number of objects studied ,<n> there are still many open questions , such as the nature of the stellar component , the metallicity dependence of the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the role of dust . to address these issues , we have obtained long - slit echelle spectroscopy of a subsample of the galaxies in the virgo cluster with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) at las campanas observatory ( lco we report on a study of the angular distribution of @xmath0co isotopes in the interstellar medium of the milky way .<n> the data were obtained with a single - beam , high - resolution spectrograph at the las campanas observatory , chile . <n> the co isotopes , co@xmath1o and co , are the most abundant elements in our galaxy , and their abundances are believed to be closely related to the galactic chemical composition and temperature . however , there has been little observational evidence to support this assertion . in this study ,<n> the angular distributions of these isotopes were measured for a range of temperatures and densities in order to investigate the possible relationship between the abundances of these elements and the chemical composition of the medium . at low temperatures , the co isotope distribution is well described by a log - normal distribution , while at high temperatures the distribution flattens out to a power - law distribution with an exponent that is independent of the temperature , density , or chemical composition . for the most neutron - rich species , such as co <n> , this behavior is expected to be due to the formation of a dense , low - density environment in which the neutrons can the number density of hi - selected galaxies in the local universe is estimated , using data from the hi nearby galaxies survey ( things ) .<n> the results are compared with the predictions of astron , lindblad , and nilson ( 1973 ) and with the theoretical predictions of hickson , kindl , & auman ( 1983 , huchtmeier - richter - magri , 1989 ; hewitt - hewitt , 1988 ; and bothun , 1997 , apj , 117 , 114 ) for the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . <n> hi is the most abundant element in the universe , accounting for about one - third of the total baryonic mass of the universe @xcite . at lower redshifts ,<n> it is the dominant component in the distribution of dark matter ( dm ) in the form of baryons . in the present study<n> , we investigate the hi content of nearby galaxies , as a function of redshift , in the context of the cosmological model of structure formation . we find that the hi number density predicted by as we present a new , high - quality catalog of redshifts for early - type galaxies , based on the shapley - ames redshift survey ( s@xmath0 $ ] ) .<n> the new catalog , which supersedes the atlas of galaxies published by scaglia , sancisi , & tammann , contains @xmath1 galaxies . the redshift distribution function ( rdf )<n> is derived from the atlas and is well - fit by a schechter function , with a mean redshift of z=0.08 , and dispersion of z=0.13 . <n> the number density of galaxies is shown to be a strong function of the hubble constant , increasing from low- to high -

smirnov ( ks ) value .<n> this has been interpreted as evidence for large deviations of the magnetic field from a constant value , most probably due to a large scale magnetic field in the ugc region . in this letter<n> we show that the large deviation of the measured transverse velocities from the ksr value can be understood as due to large scale magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects in the region of the repeaters . recent high resolution measurements of the transverse velocity of a few highly collimated microquasars have shown a large deviation from a kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) flow .<n> these results have been interpreted as evidence for a large negative differential flow ( ndrf ) , and have led to speculation on the nature of the flow and its influence on the dynamics of the system . in this letter<n> we investigate this issue in more detail , taking into account the recent determination of the ndrfs for a number of well known microquarks . <n> = 1 the results of a search for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) of frequency @xmath0 110.2 and 210.2 mev with high energy germanium detectors in ucla 94a are presented .<n> the fluxes of uhe and uhe+uhe , as well as the energies of the highest and lowest energy ions , are determined . <n> the results show that uhe neutrinos are more powerful than uhe@xmath1 neutrinos in most cases , and that the highest uhe - uhe flux is highest in the highest energy region of the spectrum , where uhe decay is most efficient . in some cases the flux of highest energy ions is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the other uhe ions . recent high - resolution spectroscopic observations of a small number of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) have shown the presence of multiple stellar - dynamical components ( sdm ) in these objects .<n> we show that these components are most likely to be the result of the interaction between the two stellar components of the parent galaxy and/or the companion . in order to understand the nature of these components and their origin ,<n> we study the dynamics of the two components and compare their masses , chemical abundances , and luminosities with those of a large sample of galaxies of different masses and metallicities . <n> we find that the majority of the sdss objects studied ( @xmath050% ) contain components of solar abundance , while a large fraction of the high - metallicity objects contain components with enhanced abundances of the elements o , mg , si , ca , s and sr . the mass of the components increases with the metallicity of the host galaxy , but decreases with the _ metallicity _ of the galaxy . on the other hand , the mass ratio between the components decreases with _<n> metallicity_. the we present the results of high - resolution , high - s / n numerical simulations of binary systems consisting of a main and a secondary component , embedded in a circumstellar disk .<n> we find that the secondary component is likely to be a disk , while the main component is most probably a close binary system . <n> our results show that the tidal interaction between the two components leads to the formation of a very eccentric orbit , and that the separation between the components is of the order of @xmath0 years for most of our systems . in our simulations ,<n> the total mass of the system does not depend strongly on the initial eccentricities of the components , but their total mass decreases with increasing separation . we investigate the nature of the multiple arms in some ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .<n> we find that most of them are probably dominated by the thermal component of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) rather than by any of the stellar component , and that the origin of the arms is likely to be related to the smbh itself . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in studying the interaction between the nuclear and the external matter of compact objects , especially in the context of the formation and early evolution of galaxies . in the standard model ,<n> the nuclear interaction is supposed to give rise to a point - like source , at which the gravitational attraction of the center causes the black hole to fall into the background and form a compact object , thus triggering the formation of an extraplanar spiral wave which eventually leads to an active galactic nucleus ( agn )<n> . however , recent studies have shown that the interaction of the nuclear matter with the external gas and radiation is probably too weak to explain the observed extraplanarity , except in a few cases where the interaction is strong enough to produce a multi - component structure in the nucleus , as recently shown by we present the results of a detailed study of the stellar dynamics of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , based on high - resolution n - body / sph simulations .<n> we find that , even in the most extreme cases , the dynamics of these systems can be very complex , and often lead to multi - stage clustering of the x - rays emitted by the nuclei , accompanied by the emission of a large amount of relativistic and gravitational radiation . in the light of these results<n> , we discuss the origin of the observed clustering and present an alternative interpretation of the clustering based on the orbital motion of the compact objects . <n> recently , a number of studies have been devoted to the investigation of the emission and absorption of radiation from compact objects ( cecs ) based on _ ab initio _ calculations . among these studies ,<n> i would like to emphasize the role played by the _ self - consistent _ model ( sccm ) @xcite , which has been widely used to describe the emission from extragalactic sources , especially in the context of the galactic centre ( gc ) emission . within this model , <n> the we present a new method to determine the number and orientation of the arms of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .<n> the method is based on numerical integration of two - dimensional , adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code , _<n> n_-body / sph , which models the motion of the central black hole , of the x - rays , and of the intra - ulx gas . <n> we apply this method to _ ugc06263 _ and _ugc09797 _ as examples . in both cases<n> , we find that the number of arms and the orientation of each arm can be determined accurately , while the _ n - body_-based method yields accurate results only for _ two - armed _ systems . we present the results of high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise spectra of four ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ugcs ) : ugc09797 , ngc11604 , ugc10439 and ugc11226 .<n> we find that the spectra of all four sources are very similar , except for the spectrum of the third source which is significantly different from that of the other three . <n> the spectra are dominated by emission lines of o viii , n viii and ne , and the n ii vii emission lines are detected only in the first two sources . in the case of ugc 11226 , the spectrum is dominated by o vii and n ii emission lines , while in the three other sources the n i viii lines are also detected , but in all cases they are too weak to be observed . the spectra can be well fitted by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models , with temperatures of @xmath0k , or by compton back - scattering models . for ugc 10439 ,<n> the models are too simple to explain the spectrum , which is well fitted we study the interaction of two stellar streams flowing through a dense interstellar medium .<n> we find that the interaction between the streams is strongly modified by the presence of the interstellar medium and leads to a redistribution of energy and angular momentum in the streams . as a result ,<n> the angular momentum of the streams depends on the density of the medium and on the number of streams present in the system . <n> recently , it has been shown that the flow of a stellar stream through a dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) can give rise to a number of interesting astrophysical phenomena , including type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( xrbs )<n> . however , the exact nature of the interaction and its influence on the properties of the stellar streams is still under debate . in this letter<n> , we investigate this issue by studying the collisional redistribution of angular momentum and energy in the stream as a function of the density and number of stream streams in a dusty ism and compare our results with those obtained in other studies . we report on the detection of a new type of gravitational wave , the so - called _ multiple _ gravitational wave ( mgw ) .<n> we find that the spectrum of the gravitational wave produced by a pair of counter - rotating black holes ( bhs ) is very broad , with a maximum frequency of @xmath0 hz , and is dominated by the contribution from multiple arms . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of gravitational waves produced by binary systems consisting of a central black hole ( bh ) and a companion star . in such systems ,<n> the interaction between the two bhs is expected to lead to the production of a non - stationary gravitational wave signal , called a _<n> multiple_. in this letter , we report for the first time the observation of multiple gravitational waves in a binary system , which are produced in the course of the interaction of the bh with its companion . we show that the multiple nature of the observed signals is due to the non - stationarity of the system . as a result<n> , a new form of gravitation can be observed , in which the system is embedded in a background of gravitational radiation  in this paper , we present the results of our investigation of the photoionization of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .<n> we find that the total energy released in the process of photo - ionization is of the order of @xmath0 erg , which is much smaller than the energy release of lyman-@xmath1 photons of the same energy . as a result ,<n> the total luminosity of the process is only a small fraction of the eddington luminosity . <n> recently , it has been found that the photo - ionization rate of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is much higher than that of the ambient medium ( hom ) @xcite . in this letter<n> we investigate the influence of the ionization of the icm on the dynamics and the total luminosities of the sources . to this end<n> , the monte carlo method has been used to simulate the radiative transfer in the framework of the brueckner - hartree - fock ( brhf ) theory . from the simulation results<n> we have obtained the following results : a ) the ionization parameter of the  we present the results of deep _ chandra _ x - ray observations of a sample of ultracompact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) .<n> we find that the mean extinctions of ugc 2808 and ngc 2903 are @xmath0 mag , and that the average extinction of ic 1325 is @xcite , in good agreement with previous results . <n> we also present new _<n> chandra_/h@xmath1 , _ egret _ and _ galex _ observations of the dwarf galaxies in our sample . in spite of the large number of available data , we are able to derive accurate extinctions for only a few of the systems . for most systems ,<n> the extinctions are accurate to within a few percents , while for a few cases , they are too low to be reliably measured , especially in the case of dwarf galaxies with large extinctions . as shown in a recent letter , the x - rays of many dwarf galaxies can be strongly affected by circumnuclear starburst activity , which can lead to significant changes in the observed x - - ray luminosities of the host galaxies . we present the results of a study of the stellar kinematics of a sample of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) , selected from the sloan digital sky survey .<n> we find that the majority of the ugc dwarf galaxies have a high degree of differential reddening , which makes them ideal targets for studying the effect of dust on the stellar distribution in dwarf galaxies . in spite of the large amount of data available , we find no evidence for a systematic difference between the distributions of the different ugcs . <n> we have studied the stellar dynamics of a large number of dwarf galaxies in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) using high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra obtained with the very large telescope ( vlt ) and very large array ( vla ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in the energy range of @xmath0 ev . for most galaxies ,<n> the vlt data are in good agreement with previous determinations of the integrated luminosity of the host galaxy , while for a few of them , the integrated luminosities are found to be too low to be consistent with the predictions of stellar evolution models  we present the results of a survey of high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) supernovae ( sne ) in the small magellanic cloud .<n> we find that the rate of decline of the fraction of sn with x - ray luminosities is much faster in more slowly accreting systems . as a result ,<n> most of the observed sn with low x - rays ( e.g. , ngc 4258 , ugc 4395 , etc . ) , which have very high rates of decline , fall into the low redshift class . on the other hand , in the case of high redshift systems , such as ugc 4486 , where the fraction is as high as 80% , the decline is much slower . in this paper<n> , we present results of the analysis of a large number of high-@xmath1 sn spectra obtained at the eso vlt and ntt arecibo telescopes , for a sample of 14 low- and high- redshift sns . for each spectrum , a detailed analysis of the evolution of the average luminosity and the average density of the sn ejecta we present the results of a study of the x - ray emission from a sample of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) , selected from the pan - starrs1 survey .<n> we find that most of the ugcs studied show emission that can not be explained by the effects of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) in a self - consistent way . <n> the results presented here are based on the analysis of high - resolution , high - s / n , _ ab initio _ n - body simulations , which have been performed to investigate the effect of the isrf and the ebl on the observed spectra , and also to study the possible dependence of the observed emission on the geometry of the system . in spite of the large uncertainties , the results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained in previous studies , especially with respect to the emission of the soft x - rays ( sxr ) which are believed to be the main source of ionization for the intracluster medium in ucdws . at high redshifts ,<n> the emission from uc dwarf galaxies is dominated by we present the results of a survey of extragalactic radio continuum emission with the very large array ( vla ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in the first half of the 21@xmath0 century .<n> the vla was used to obtain vla @xmath1 data for a number of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) and open clusters . <n> the analysis of these vla data shows that most of the galactic clusters studied in this survey show a clear excess of flux above the extrapolation of the extrapolation from the galactic values , which can be attributed to the contribution from the intracluster medium ( icm ) . in spite of the large number of detected clusters , most of them are located in relatively isolated environments , where the icm is not expected to play a significant role in the emission of galactic radiation , and the emission is dominated by the emission from the hot intracluster gas . as a result ,<n> the average icm flux is found to be too low to explain the observed excess of emission in some of these clusters ; however , the excess can be well explained by the effect of icm emission in the cluster environment , i.e. , we present the results of high -

body hamiltonian may be prepared in a superposition of ground states and metastable states .<n> we prove that in the thermodynamic limit this superposition may not be obtained from any of the @xmath0 ground states or from any configuration of metastable particles . as a result<n> , any system in the superfluid - supersolid phase transition , in the high - temperature phase , may not have a superfluid ground state . <n> introduction the study of superfluids and supersolids is one of the most important topics in modern physics . in superfluid helium @xcite and in superconductors<n> the quantum phase transition between the normal and the superconducting states occurs at zero temperature . at finite temperature , however , there is a non - zero difference in the energy of the two states , known as the zero - temperature ( tm ) transition . for a system of fermions in two dimensions ,<n> the ttm transition occurs when the fermion number is equal to or greater than its zero - point quantum number . on the other hand , for bosons we study the stability of long - range order in a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate with nearest - neighbor interactions .<n> we find that the condensate is metastable for any value of the interaction strength . for large interaction strengths metastable states<n> dominate the low - energy physics , but are metastable only for a narrow range of interaction strengths . in the thermodynamic limit<n> the condensate becomes unstable for all values of the coupling . <n> pacs numbers : 03.75.fi , 05.30.jp , 64.70.md the study of quantum many - body systems has experienced a dramatic increase in recent years @xcite due to the advent of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , which allows the calculation of the ground - state energy of a quantum system from the properties of the lowest - energy states . however , in spite of the great success of the mrg method it has not yet been applied to study long - ranged order in quantum systems . here<n> we show that it is possible to find the conditions under which a system is stable against the formation of a metastable state . by considering the decay of two - point density correlation long - range order in quantum many - body systems is often described in terms of phase separation . here<n> we show that phase separation is also present in the steady state of a system of interacting particles in one spatial dimension .<n> we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods , and show that in the thermodynamic limit this phase separation persists up to the particle number infinity . <n> the order parameter of a quantum system is the difference between the number of particles in the ground state and all other states of the system . in equilibrium ,<n> this number is given by @xmath0 , where the system is in thermal equilibrium . for many years<n> this order parameter has been considered to be a measure of the quantum state , independent of the microscopic details of the hamiltonian . however , in recent years it has become clear that there are many different types of order parameter , each of which can be described by a different set of equations of motion @xcite . as a consequence<n> , it has been suggested that a different order parameter is needed to describe a system , called the phase - separation parameter . a phase separation parameter<n> is defined as the ratio of the lengths of the domains of a phase - we show that the walker problem , which describes the collective motion of an ensemble of interacting particles in a random medium , can be mapped onto the problem of a single particle moving in a medium with broken translational symmetry .<n> we use this mapping to derive an exact expression for the correlation function of the walker motion in the large-@xmath0 limit , where @xmath1 is the number of walkers in the medium . in this limit<n> , the walker - particle correlation function is given by the product of two terms , one which is proportional to the square of the speed of light , and the other which is independent of this speed . <n> the collective behavior of interacting many - body systems has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years @xcite . among the many phenomena which have been studied ,<n> one of the most intriguing is the collective dynamics of interacting quantum particles in random media . as a paradigmatic example , in a two - dimensional lattice model of interacting fermions , it has been shown that the motion of a collection of identical particles can be described by a random walk in a lattice , with the walkers moving in the background of the lattice and the particles remaining at we consider a class of one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chains with nearest - neighbor interactions and show that , if the spin - spin interaction is weaker than the coupling constant @xmath1 , the ground state wavefunctions of the chain can not be exponentially localized .<n> however , in the presence of nearest - neighbour interactions , we show that the ground states of the model can have exponentially localized excitations . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.yz , 03.67.mn , 05.30.fk , 75.10.pq the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the most active areas in modern physics . in this context<n> , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) plays an important role , as it is responsible for various phenomena , such as the antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite , and the spin hall effect ( she ) , which is a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the symmetries of nature . as a result ,<n> soc has been extensively studied in quantum information theory ( qit ) and quantum computation ( qc ) as well as in the field we show that the number of excited states that can be created in a bipartite fermi gas of @xmath0 spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interactions is bounded from below by the number and the species of the excited states in the ground state .<n> we also show that excited states can not be created within a distance of more than one particle from the center of the gas . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.yz , 05.30.fk , 64.60.cn the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the properties of quantum degenerate systems , such as fermi gases of bosons and fermionic atoms , interacting with each other via repulsive short - range interactions @xcite . among the many types of quantum systems that have been studied<n> are bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of atoms in optical lattices , superfluids of atoms interacting via the coulomb potential , and josephson junctions in superconducting circuits . the latter two systems have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years due to their intriguing properties  we show that a three component system of three interacting species is phase separated in the thermodynamic limit , even when the global densities of the three species are not equal .<n> we support this conclusion with extensive monte carlo simulations . <n> phase separation is one of the most striking features of nature @xcite . in nature<n> there are many examples of non - equilibrium phase transitions , such as degeneracies , spontaneous symmetry breaking , or the emergence of macroscopic order . at the same time , there are also a number of examples of phase transitions in discrete systems of interacting particles , for which there are no known analytical or numerical methods to prove the existence of a complete phase separation . here<n> we present an analytical theory for the phase separation of a three species interacting system of particles with a repulsive , short - ranged interaction @xmath0 , and an attractive , long - ranged one . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we demonstrate that the system exhibits a phase separated state in the limit of vanishing , but non - zero , global density of the particles . for a system with three independent species<n> , we find that the density of each species , @x we study the coarsening process of a two - component bose - einstein condensate into three domains when the number of particles of each species is not equal . in the thermodynamic limit<n> the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken and the system is no longer in a state of translational invariance .<n> we argue that in this limit the system will phase separate into @xmath0 domains , even when the two species have different numbers of particles . using a simple toy model and monte carlo simulations ,<n> we show that the time scale for domain growth grows exponentially with the system size . <n> phase separation is one of the most fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics and is observed in a wide range of systems , ranging from simple liquids to complex many - body systems @xcite . during phase separation<n> the system may be in one of three states : a supercooled liquid , a mott insulator , or a superfluid , depending on the temperature and the chemical potential . at low temperatures and chemical potentials<n> the superfluid state is the ground state of the system , while at higher temperatures the system undergoes a first order phase transition into the mott insulating state , which is characterized by broken translational symmetry  we introduce a simple toy model of a coarsening process and use it to derive a domain growth law , @xmath0 , as a function of the time .<n> the growth law is found to be in excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations of the model . <n> pacs numbers : 05.20.dd , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 68.35.rh 2 recently , it has been realized that the coarsening of domains in systems with many degrees of freedom can be quite complex @xcite . in this letter<n> we present a toy model which captures some of the essential features of the process . using this toy model<n> we derive domain growth laws , which are in good agreement with simulations , for systems with a large number of particles , and for those in which the dynamics is driven by the exchange of particles between domains of the same species . to illustrate the power of the toy model , we present results for a model of two species of particles with two different species of coarsening , where the particles are represented by a pair of gaussians , say , e and e@xmath1 , separated by @x we study the dynamics of a two - state stochastic lattice gas with quenched rare event dynamics .<n> the lattice gas is initially prepared in one of three domains , which are separated by a length of @xmath0 , and then it is allowed to coarsen in time : the length of the domain is modified by carrying out one of the following processes : ( i ) a quench at a constant rate , ( ii ) an increase at a rate which is inversely proportional to the time it takes the system to reach the coarsening state , or ( iii ) the quench is repeated in order to keep the system at the state with the same rate of events . <n> we find that , as in the case of the quenched ising model @xcite , the system reaches a stationary state which is characterized by a discontinuity in the probability to find the system in a metastable state . in the limit of infinite coarsening time ,<n> the stationary state is identical to the one found in the absence of quenched quenched dynamics , provided that the quench rate is sufficiently large compared to the relaxation time of the system . for short times<n> , however , there is a non - we study the ordering dynamics in a three - domain coarsening process using a toy model .<n> the toy model enables one to simulate the coarsening dynamics by using an efficient monte carlo algorithm suitable for rare event dynamics . using this toy model<n> we show that the average domain size scales as @xmath0 , where the exponent @xcite is independent of the dimensionality of the system and depends only on the dimension of the lattice . we also show that a mean - field version of the toy - model enables us to obtain the scaling behavior . <n> ordering dynamics is one of the most fundamental problems in statistical mechanics . in order to understand the ordering behavior of complex systems ,<n> it is necessary to consider the time evolution of the state of a system consisting of a finite number of microscopic domains , which can be represented by a lattice of permutations . at each time step , the system coarsens by releasing particles from one domain and then releasing them back into the other domain . here<n> we consider the case of three domains where each domain can be described by a single particle . for simplicity , we consider a one - dimensional scalar model , in which the dynamics is governed by the ising model we study a mean - field version of the ordering dynamics in a one - dimensional toy model .<n> the model consists of @xmath0 domains , of which one is long and the other is short . in the scaling limit , the model reduces to the scalar model studied by derrida _ et al . _<n> [ phys . rev . lett . * 84 * , 2993 ( 2000 ) ] , in which all species order at the same time . we find that the mean field model exhibits a non - trivial scaling behavior in the vicinity of the transition from the long - species to the short - species ordered state . at the transition ,<n> the particle number in the long domain is proportional to the number of its nearest neighbors , while in the short domain it is a power - law function of the length of the shortest domain , with an exponent which is independent of the system s dimensionality and of the strength of the coupling between the domains . the order - disorder transition ( eso ) @xcite is a crossover from a disordered to an ordered state as a function of a dimensionless parameter , such as dimensionality or coupling between domains @x we derive the growth law for the number of domains of a given size in a toy model of particle - particle interactions .<n> we show that in the large - time limit this growth law is given by the scaling form @xmath0 , which is in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations of the toy model . <n> the study of growth laws in dynamics has a long history @xcite . in the simplest case ,<n> the dynamics is governed by mean - field dynamics , where the particles are allowed to move freely in a bounded domain . for more complex situations , such as particle - mediated interactions , the dynamics<n> is determined by the dynamics in the bulk of the system , in which case the dynamics can be described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . on the other hand , for non - interacting systems<n> the time dependence of the dynamics should be taken into account in order to derive the correct growth law . since the introduction of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) lagrangian for particle interactions more than 50 years ago , it has been well known that the tf equation can be solved exactly in the small - time and large the steady - state properties of a one - dimensional toy model with three different species of particles are studied using a recently introduced matrix ansatz method . the partition function and the correlation function are calculated in the thermodynamic limit , and the scaling form of the average domain size is obtained .<n> the results are used to study finite -

state properties of a one - dimensional stochastic binary mixture of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles .<n> the particles interact only through particle - particle collisions , but may also interact with each other . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we show that the steady state is characterized by the presence or absence of long - range correlations between the particles in the binary mixture . <n> the study of stochastic binary mixtures ( sbms ) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a system consisting of one dimensional binary mixtures of lj particles interacting via particle -

jacobi equation to the case of time reversal invariance ( tr ) . the tr of this equation is the same as the one for the effective potential , except that it is deformed by the time reversal , so that it can be seen as a deformed hamilton s equation . since this deformation is of relevance in other stochastic we introduce a tensor ansatz for bosons on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions .<n> the tensor product of the product is given by a partition function which depends on the number of particles in the system . for a system with @xmath0 particles<n> we find that the partition function has the same form as the one for the non - interacting case . in the presence of an interaction ,<n> the energy of the ground state of the system is shifted to higher energies due to the tensor products . as a result of this energy shift , there is a new ground state which is characterized by a non - zero topological degeneracy . <n> pacs numbers : 03.75.fi , 05.30.fk , 67.40.vs there has been much recent interest in the study of strongly correlated quantum many body systems ( qmbs ) @xcite . the interest in these systems is driven by the prospect of realizing new states of matter , such as superconductivity or the mott insulator phase , as well as by the possibility of controlling the nature of these new states by tuning parameters such as the interaction strength , the dimensionality , and the spatial distribution of the particles  we derive a tensor ansatz for the partition function of a system of interacting fermions in one dimension , and use it to obtain a set of recursion relations for all correlation functions .<n> these recursion relations are solved numerically for finite systems . using these relations<n> we calculate the correlation function , which is a measure of the phase separation in the system , for various system sizes . in the disordered case , @xmath0 , we find that the system is phase separated in the thermodynamic limit . <n> the study of interacting quantum many - body systems has seen rapid progress in the last few years , driven in part by the realization that such systems may exhibit exotic phases such as superconductivity or superfluidity @xcite . among the many types of quantum phases that have been investigated ,<n> the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model is perhaps the most well known , due to the simplicity of its solution and the ease with which it can be studied . despite the ubiquity of 1d systems in nature , there has been little progress in understanding the phase diagram of interacting systems , even in the limit of large system size . for example , it is well known that the we argue for the existence of phase separation in a system of particles with four species .<n> the argument is based on a set of recursion relations that relate the evolution of the system to the exchange of particles between nearest neighbors . using these recursion relations<n> we have calculated the correlation function , which is a measure of the phase separation , for various system sizes . in the disordered case , @xmath0 , we find a critical value of the ratio between the domain size and the domain wall width , close to the natural critical point . a generalization of the model to four species is also discussed . <n> pacs numbers : 05.70.ln , 05.50.+q , 64.60.cn , 75.10.nr phase separation is one of the most striking features of many -

zero . in the special case of equal densities we find that the steady state generated by the local stochastic dynamics is exactly given by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian . phase separation for this case is explicitly demonstrated . the model provides an explicit example for the mechanism leading to phase separation or breaking of ergodicity in systems with _ local _ stochastic dynamics . # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#1 stochastic @xmath0 models have been widely used to model a variety of phenomena in physics , chemistry , and biology , such as the diffusion of molecules and bacteria , the dynamics of dna and the clustering of rnas , as well as the behavior of bacteria in biofilms . however , in spite of their widespread use , there is no consensus as to the origin of phase separation and the mechanisms leading to it . phase separation in a one -

size systems . <n> the dynamics of phase separation reduces to a coarsening problem where the typical domain size grows logarithmically in time . with direct numerical simulations only small systems can be studied . however , by employing a toy model in which domains rather than individual sites are updated one can simulate much larger systems and probe the scaling regime . we study a mean - field model of a one - dimensional array of point - like particles with nearest - neighbor interactions .<n> we show that the model exhibits a first - order phase transition from a high - density to a low -

charged colloids . here<n> , we study in detail a simple model of an array of interacting particles in a uniform magnetic field , which exhibits a phase transition in the form of a discontinuous jump in the particle density at a critical value of the field . at the transition , the density of the array changes discontinuously , with a jump of order @xmath0 , where @x we introduce a simple model of interacting spinless particles in a ring of size @xmath0 , where each particle species is characterized by its type .<n> we show that the steady state of this model is a one dimensional quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) , characterized by a gap in the steady - state energy spectrum , which is closed for large values of the strength of nearest - neighbor interactions . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,<n> this gap is closed at a non - zero value of the local magnetization . <n> quantum spin systems @xcite have attracted much attention in recent years , due to their relevance to condensed matter physics , quantum computation , and quantum information processing . among the many phenomena that have been studied in these systems , one of the most important is the quantum melting of ice in a magnetic field@xcite , a phenomenon that has not been observed in any other situation so far . the melting of an ice surface is intimately related to the dynamics of a quantum spin system , as it is the only known non -

130 , at a redshift of z=0.331 .<n> we report alma observations of this source using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , finding that the flux density of s gr a * varies by more than a factor of 10 on timescales as short as a few hours . <n> the sma data are consistent with alma s detection in 2012 , when it was made at a much lower redshift , z=0.36 , but are inconsistent with the detection at a higher redshift ( z=0.11 ) obtained with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) in 2012 and 2013 . in 2013 ,<n> alma detected the source at z=0.25 , which is significantly lower than the previously reported value of 0.32 . using the new detections of the radio emission from sg a * , we find that the radio spectrum of the source is consistent with a flat spectrum , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is one of the most active regions of star formation in the universe , with more than 100 active sites of young stellar objects ( ysos ) within its borders .<n> one of these active sites , sagittarius a * , is a well - studied , rotationally - dominated co - emitting yso , which has been well studied both observationally and theoretically . using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , we monitored sgr a * for several months in order to track the flux density of this active yso on sub - milliarcsecond ( mas ) scales . we found that the mean spectrum from sma data is consistent with that from alma , vla , and the _ herschel space observatory _ ( _ hst _ ) over a wide range of flux density scales , from 10@xmath0 to @xmath1 mjy . over the same range ,<n> the visibility data from the sma indicate that the flux from the active site , as well as diffuse emission from the surrounding warm dust , varies on timescales of a few to a few years . we present observations of sgr a * using the very large array ( vla ) , the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( sma ) and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( alma ) at a range of wavelengths between 1 and 690 ghz .<n> these observations were carried out to search for emission from the supermassive black hole in the coma cluster , which is presumed to be the site of the original engine that powered the galaxy . using the sma<n> , we detected the synchrotron emission from s gr a * and j1733 - 130 at @xmath0 significance , and we also detected the emission from two other compact extragalactic black holes , ngc 6240 and mrk 766 . <n> the first to be detected from a compact object is the super massive black hole ( smbh ) associated with the core of the coma galaxy , sagittarius a*.<n> the smbh has a mass of 10@xmath1 , making it one of the most massive black holes known . in its center ,<n> the black hole is surrounded by a ring of 14 parsecs in diameter , with a radius of @x we present simultaneous submillimeter and radio observations of sgr a * made with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the very large array ( vla ) .<n> the data cover a frequency range of @xmath0@xmath1 , corresponding to a physical scale radius of about 10 schwarzschild radii for an assumed isotropic accretion flow . in this paper<n> , we present the results of a search for spectral curvature and spectral steepening in the millimeter and submillimeter spectra of the supermassive black hole candidate , using data from the vla and the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) as well as from the _ herschel space observatory _ ( _ hst _ ) in the infrared and optical bands . <n> we find that the spectral index between 217 and 355 ghz is flatter and more variable than those of the calibrators , and shows evidence for steepening at short wavelengths . between 230 and 690 ghz ,<n> the spectrum is consistent with a flat or slightly declining power - law spectrum . assuming stationary statistics for  we present multi - frequency , multi - epoch observations of the microquasar sgr a * made with the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) , the karl g. jansky very large array ( vlt ) and the sub - millimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in the @xmath0 and @xcite bands , as well as in the infrared ( ir ) bands from the vlt and keck observatories .<n> these observations were motivated by our recent detection of variability in the radio through submillimeter range , which we attribute to changes in the accretion flow geometry . <n> we also present the results of our simultaneous radio - through - ir observations , and discuss the implications of these measurements in the context of theoretical models for the emission and absorption of the source . in this paper<n> , we present our analysis of the alma and vlt data , along with new ir measurements from the keck observatory . here<n> we focus on the radio properties of s gr a * , including the spectrum , variability , linear polarization , spectral index the spectrum of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy , sgr a * , was observed by the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) in the @xmath0 kev band during the fall of 2008 .<n> the spectrum is dominated by emission from the bow shock region of the accretion flow onto the black hole , and can be fit self - consistently with a two - temperature model : a thermal plasma and a nonthermal population of electrons and positrons . in this paper<n> , we present the alma spectrum , along with the ir and x - ray data from the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) and _ swift _ ( xmm - newton ) , as well as the first ir spectrum from the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) during the commissioning of the herschel space observatory ( hsto ) telescope . <n> the alma data are consistent with a plasma with a temperature of a few@xmath1 k in the alma band , with a peak in the self - absorbed spectrum extending to a few tens of kev . however , we report on the results of a three - year experiment to observe the bow shock emission from g2 near 1 ghz with the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> the experiment was designed to test predictions that the radio emission from the interaction of g2 with the accretion flow near periastron could be used to constrain the efficiency of nonthermal electron energy production , the density profile of the inflow flow , and the cross - sectional area of the shock . between october 2012 and may 2014 ,<n> the 1.5 ghz excess flux density changed by at most 12 mjy ( 2% ) over the course of this experiment . in the first epochs of the experiment , october 2012 - may 2014<n> , we observed a @xmath0 jy increase in the l band flux density , but no significant secular change was observed in the 0.5 - 2.4 ghz band between the first and last epochs . the 1.5 and l band data alone<n> show that no secular change has occurred between the two epochs in the radio excess flux , suggesting that the nonthermal population in g2 has not changed significantly since the onset of the radio flare in october 2012 . from october 2012 to we report the results of a two - year , multi - frequency vla experiment to measure the radio continuum emission from the bow shock in the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 6946 . between october 2012 and may 2014 , the average 1 ghz flux density has been constant at @xmath0 jy , with no significant secular change .<n> the average flux density at 1.5 ghz has increased by at most 12 mjy ( 2% ) over the course of our experiment , which is comparable to the predictions of some models for the timescale of the radio emission . at 5 ghz ,<n> the flux density excess has risen by at least a factor of 5 , reaching a peak of 1.8 jy on 2013 august 08 , and then declining over the remainder of the experiment . in the first 15 epochs of this experiment<n> , no significant time scale variation has occurred . for 11 of 15<n> epochs , a 95% confidence upper limit of 0.4 jy can be placed on the average excess , but for the remaining four epochs the upper limit is 0.8 jy we present new very large array ( vla ) observations of the low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) g2 - 2 , obtained in 2013 august - september .<n> these observations cover a total of 15 epochs , from 2013 august 08 to 2013 september 20 , with a total integration time of @xmath0 s . <n> the new data are consistent with previous studies of this agn in terms of flux density , variability , size , and spectral index . in the total flux density spectrum , we find no excess over average values , exclude g2 as a radio galaxy , set a 95% confidence upper limit on the size of g2 , show a higher - than - historical mean radio flux density over historical averages , find higher radio flux densities at lower frequencies , have lower mean flux density at most frequencies relative to the new vla data , indicate variability with amplitudes differences between epochs and over the whole radio spectrum and a four - month moving average of the average flux density of the source . the accretion flow onto g2 is likely in a highly radiatively inefficient state , either due to a magnetically arrested cloud or a pressure - confined stellar wind we present measurements of the flux density of sgr a * at band 6 ( 230 ghz ) , band 7 ( 345 , 690 , and 21 ghz respectively ) and historical data from the submillimeter array ( sma ) at band 7 and 345 ghz with dates from 2001 through 2012 .<n> we also present results from alma and sma observations with similar timescales . using this data<n> , we measure the mean flux density to be @xmath0 jy , a result that is consistent with typical low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) variability levels . a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that our results are consistent with originating from the same distribution as @xcite . we present new vla , alma , and sma observations of sgr a * at 230 ghz , 345 ghz and 220 ghz with the goal of testing the hypothesis that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this seyfert 1 galaxy has remained remarkably stable over the past three decades .<n> we find that the vla spectrum is characterized by a simple power law form ( @xmath0 ) over a frequency interval of 0.1 to 2 cycle / day , consistent with historical estimates from radio to submillimeter wavelengths . <n> the alma and the sma light curves are similar and have the same significances as our vla and alma measurements . the 230 and 345 and band 6 and 7 ghz distributions differ from the @xcite distributions , but are consistent with typical llagn variability levels . similar to the case with the radio spectrum , there is no clear evidence that the millimeter and submillimeter changes are the result of the g2 periastron . the spectrum of sgr a * from radio to submillimeter wavelengths has remained remarkably stable over the past 30 years .<n> our new vla , alma , and sma results demonstrate that this stability has continued throughout the apparent periastron passage of g2 . in the case of low - frequency emission , the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole . this smaller bow shock size is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models . @xcite propose a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent with our results . we report the discovery of a bow shock in g2 in the low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) sgr a * .<n> the bow shock is likely to be the result of the interaction of a g2 bow shock with the accretion flow onto the black hole . between vlt and keck observations ,<n> primarily determines the creation of a shock . some form of confinement for the diffuse gas appears to be important for attenuating the shock amplitude . <n> the lack of any enhanced short wavelength radio and millimeter emission from the black holes is also consistent with a compact size for g2 . simulations have shown that more extended objects are more readily disrupted and would therefore be more likely to have some gas initiate enhanced accretion onto theblack hole<n> . the mean flux density has not increased by more than @xmath0 relative to historical averages , within the range of variations seen in the past and in other llgn . at shorter wavelengths , the mean ir - to - radio flux density<n> has not enhanced significantly , in contrast to expectations for a g2-induced enhancement of the accretion rate . in order for the disrupted material to enhance the flux density , it must reach a radius of a we present alma observations of sgr a * at frequencies from 100 to 950 ghz .<n> the millimeter / submillimeter spectrum is consistent with a flat spectrum , as expected for stratified emission from an accretion disk with optical depth in transition between optically thick and thin . at these frequencies , the event horizon telescope ( eht ) will be able to image the radio through millimeter emission from g2 s . <n> gravitational lensing ( gl ) is a powerful tool to probe the accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , providing constraints on the mass accretion rate , geometry of the accretion disk , and the nature and origin of the accreting material . the gravitationally lensed source , g2@xmath0 , was first observed in the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength regime with the _ hubble space telescope _<n> ( _ hst _ ) @xcite , revealing a black hole shadow that is offset by @xmath1 from the gravitational radius of the black hole . in the radio / millimeter regime ,<n> the source has been monitored with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) we have used submillimeter array ( alma ) observations to search for continuum emission from the extreme horizontal branch ( eht ) of the milky way .<n> this search is motivated by the fact that the submillimeter and near infrared ( nir ) regimes are more sensitive to continuum emission than the far infrared ( fir ) regime , which is used in most eht studies . in this search<n> , we found no significant submillimeter continuum emission in any eht source , and we place an upper limit of @xmath010@xmath1 mjy on the continuum emission of any source within our search region , assuming a spectral index of 1.5 and a dust temperature of 100 k. this upper limit is consistent with the dust temperature in our alma field of view , but is significantly lower than that of the _ herschel _ infrared deep survey ( hermes ) , indicating that the dust emission detected by hermes may not be extended to larger distances from the sun . <n> the extreme , high - redshift universe ( ehn ) is characterized by a large number of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that have masses and sizes similar to the solar neighborhood @xcite . we present high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements of the superconducting phase diagram of @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xcite in the normal state .<n> we find that the superconducting transition temperature decreases with the sample volume , and that the critical temperature for the onset of superconductivity increases with the volume fraction of the sample . in the superconducting state ,<n> the phase diagram exhibits a crossover from a high - temperature superconductor to a low - temperature antiferromagnet , accompanied by a decrease in the critical field and a change in the slope of the specific heat curve . <n> the superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature @xcite has been of great interest to the community due to the rapid progress in the development of a variety of novel materials that exhibit high critical current densities and critical current - voltage characteristics . at the same time , however , there is a lack of experimental data to characterize the temperature - dependent properties of these materials , such as the superconducting - to - normal - state ( sn - ns ) phase diagram , which has been predicted to exhibit a transition from a bcs - like to an anisotropic superconducting state as a function of we report on the development of a new type of micro - electro - mechanical system , the so - called _ microlens _ , which can be used to measure the electric field gradient across a surface .<n> we demonstrate that the micro - lens can be operated as a high - sensitivity , high - resolution , and high - speed imager . using this imager<n> , we have measured the electric - field gradient in a nb - doped nbse@xmath0 microlens with a resolution of about @xmath1 . <n> microlensing is one of the most powerful tools available for the study of high - quality micro - fabricated devices @xcite . in micro -lensing ,<n> a movable lens is used to make a point - like point contact with a target surface ; the lens is then imaged with a camera with a focal plane that is parallel to the target surface and perpendicular to the lens axis . the focal plane of the microlens can be adjusted by changing the position of the target or by applying an electric field . due to the high quality of the image , micro - lenses<n> have been used to study a wide range of phenomena in physics @x we report on the fabrication and characterization of a @xmath0 nm laser - pulse generator ( lpg ) .<n> the device consists of an e - print of an ab - initio quantum dot coupled to an atomic force microscope ( afm ) to produce a high - resolution single - photon pulse with a pulse repetition rate of 10@xmath1 hz / s . the device is demonstrated to operate at room temperature , with a peak power of 15.8 v / cm , and a pulse shape with a gaussian profile . <n> the ability to produce high - quality e - prints is a key requirement for the development of quantum technologies , such as quantum computers @xcite , quantum photonics @xxcite and ultra - sensitive force microscopy ( uro)@xcite for atomic and molecular physics . for these applications ,<n> it is important to have a method for producing e -prints that can be scaled up to large numbers of photons , while maintaining a low cost and a high quality of output photon . to this end<n> , it has been proposed that a quantum dot ( qd ) can be used as a source of single photons . we report on a systematic study of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment of co@xmath0fe , which is known to exhibit a maximum at @xmath1 .<n> we find that the magnetic field and temperature dependence of this quantity are well described by a simple model , in which the magnetic moment is determined by a combination of the coulomb repulsion and a zeeman field . <n> the magnetic properties of metals have been the subject of intense interest in recent years @xcite . in this letter , we focus on the role of the electron - electron interaction in determining the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a variety of correlated electron systems , such as transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) , heavy fermion superconductors ( hfscs ) and cuprates , as well as single electron systems ( ssps ) with different lattice constants and lattice spacings . for these systems<n> , it is well known that the electron interaction leads to a large variation of the electronic charge and magnetization , and a large degree of disorder in the system s electronic structure . on the other hand ,<n> the we report on the evolution of the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) in a high quality two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) over a broad temperature range , @xmath0 .<n> the results are based on high resolution time - of - flight magnetograms , obtained at the los alamos national laboratory , and are in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions . at low temperatures ,<n> the mce exhibits a broad maximum at a field - induced maximum in the resistivity , accompanied by a sharp drop in the specific heat and a change in the slope of the resistivity - temperature phase diagram . in the high temperature regime<n> , the temperature - dependent mce is well described by a modified curie - weiss law , while in the low temperature regime , it is well fitted by a model of a broken - symmetry state . <n> magnetocalorimetry @xcite is a powerful tool to characterize the macroscopic properties of materials . for example , in the presence of a magnetic field , _<n> e.g. _ , induced by an applied electric field or a magnetic impurity , a macroscopic magnetic field can be measured we present the results of a study of the stellar kinematics and dynamics of a sample of six massive x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) at redshifts @xmath0 using high - resolution , high - s / n data from the _ swift _ satellite .<n> we find that the xrb velocity ellipsoids are well described by a power - law with an index of -1.5 , similar to that of the galactic disk , but that the velocity dispersions are larger than expected from the extrapolation of the local isotropic velocity dispersion distribution to high redshift , as expected for baryonic , isothermal orbits . <n> the discovery of x - rays with luminosities above the tev range @xcite has been followed by a wealth of high - quality data for a variety of classes of objects , including binaries , supernovae ( sne ) , pulsars ( psrs ) and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwnne , which are the remnants of massive stars that exploded as massive stars ) as well as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs)@xcite . in this letter<n> , we present a we present multi - band photometric observations of four ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , namely , alma x-3 , cetus x-1 , and rxj 1608.4 - 2901 .<n> we find that all four objects are dominated by continuum emission from a hot dust component , with @xmath0 mags . in all four cases ,<n> the continuum emission is dominated by a single power - law component with spectral slope @xcite . <n> _ introduction _ : _ it is well - known that dust emission can play an important role in many astrophysical systems , including star - forming galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( xbs ) as well as the galactic center ( gc ) ( see e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein )<n> . however , it is still unclear whether dust emission is a universal property of agn or whether it is dependent on the intrinsic properties of the host galaxy . to investigate this<n> , we present photometric measurements of the dust emission from these objects using alma s adaptive optics ( ao ) system . we present a comparative study of the angular spectra of the isolated nucleon - nucleon collisions at high energy ( @xmath0 ) between alma and , using the non - perturbative rescattering method ( nrm ) .<n> we find that the angular spectrum of the collision between two nucleons depends strongly on the orientation of the pair of nucleons relative to the line of sight . in the case of three nucleons ,<n> the two - dimensional angular spectrum is dominated by a single peak , while for four nucleons the peak shifts to a double peak and eventually merges with the single peak to form a three - dimensional spectrum , similar to the four - dimensional ampere - cousins spectrum . <n> we also study the collision of two high - energy nucleons and find that both of them are strongly affected by the presence of the third nucleon , with the impact parameter of one of the nucleons being larger than that of the second one . using the nrm method<n> , we estimate the collisionality of the individual nucleons in the collision and find a good agreement between our numerical results and the experimental data . we study the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 ( rns ) effect in heavy - ion collisions at @xmath1 gev based on semi - analytical perturbative qcd calculations .<n> we find that both the surface tension and the collisional energy are enhanced relative to the uncorrelated cases , and that the total collision number is reduced with increasing collision energy . as a consequence ,<n> the rds factors are reduced compared to the usual coulomb resummation . <n> collisions of heavy ions at high kinetic energies are shown to be sensitive to the surface environment of the parent star , as the surface energy is reduced as the collision energy is increased . in turn , this results in the suppression of the surface tensions of heavy quark and antiquark stars , which are predicted to be enhanced due to the renormalization of heavy - quark effective masses in collisional dynamics . at high collision energies , however , the enhancement of surface tensions does not depend on the surface interaction , but only on the initial energy of the quark star . for a quark model with equal coupling strengths to heavy and light quarks , surface tension is we study the transverse dynamics of the collisional subdwarfs of the supermassive black hole at @xmath0 tev observed at the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) based on high resolution data .<n> we find that the black hole is de - redshifted with respect to the observer , reaching a maximum redshift of about -26 , and that it is strongly influenced by the companion . <n> pacs numbers : : 26.60.+c , 26.50.+x , 97.60.bw we report the discovery of two new bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , namely , the so - called  third bec '' and the  fourth becs '' .<n> these becs are pairs of counter - rotating becs with opposite polarities , which do not couple to each other , but are separated by an energy gap . as a result of this separation ,<n> the second bec has a lower condensate than the third one , and the third becs has a higher condensate than either of the first two becs<n> . the properties of the becs can be strongly affected by the presence of the fourth bec , as shown by the comparison of the light curves from the sub - chandrasekhar x - ray timing system ( cccxts ) with those from the bec of the tpc-2 at the beijing 100mhz . <n> bec condensates are interesting because they can be used to study the interplay between gravity and non - gravitational fields . in particular , they are useful to investigate the effects of non - adiabatic expansion in the vicinity of a bec and to probe the potential coupling between adia we present the first results of a project to study the evolution of the coulomb blueshifted supermassive black hole at the center of the giant molecular cloud of the milky way .<n> we find that the black hole s mass increases by more than an order of magnitude from its zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) value , reaching a maximum mass of @xmath0 at a redshift of 0.11 , before undergoing a phase of rapid mass transfer . during this phase ,<n> black hole masses increase by a factor of two , from zero to a few hundred , due to a simultaneous increase in the number of black holes , but also due to an increase in their number density , resulting in a total black hole mass that is higher than their tams values . in the future<n> , we expect black hole formation to be strongly affected by the formation of molecular clouds , which will further increase the mass of the black holes and consequently their mass and density . <n> black holes are the most common objects in the universe , accounting for about one - third of the total mass , with masses ranging from a few tenths of a solar mass down to the bottom of the  we present multi - epoch optical spectroscopy of a sample of six quasars ( qsos ) at redshifts @xmath0 .<n> the spectra were obtained with the hubble space telescope stis multi - object spectrograph , covering the wavelength range of 3700 - 7400 nm . in most cases , the spectra are dominated by continuum emission from a hot , massive , red supergiant ( rsg ) or a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , and can be adequately fitted with a blackbody or a power - law ( pl ) model . however , in a few cases the continuum emission is too weak to be fitted by a pl model , possibly due to the presence of a central compact object , such as a main - sequence star or a planetary companion . instead , most of the spectra can be fitted with either a pl or pl model and are consistent with rsgs with moderate reddenings , suggesting that the central object is a supergiant or a bl lac object . <n> = 1 [ firstpage ] stars : individual : sgrastar ism : kinematics and dynamics galaxies : stellar we report on the discovery of sub - luminosities for a number of high - redshift ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) agns .<n> these high - quality data reveal that the agn - resolved spectra are dominated by emission lines from highly - ionised gas , with a large fraction of the lines being blueshifted from the systemic velocity . in most cases ,<n> the line widths are larger than the continuum redshifts , indicating that the gas is expanding at a higher velocity than the radiation from the central agn . <n> we show that the line - widths are correlated with the expansion velocity , which can be used to estimate the expansion rate of the central engines , once the gas has decelerated to the decelerated speed of light . for a few systems , we find that the expansion velocities increase with decreasing redshift , while for others , they decrease monotonically with redshift<n> . we also present the first detections of emission lines in agn spectra from low - mass black holes ( bhs ) with the elisa and xmm - newton telescopes , showing that the emission lines originate from the innermost part of the accretion disk we present multi - band photometric monitoring observations of a sample of nine active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with soft x - ray luminosities of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .<n> the majority of the objects are found to have hard spectrum , with x - rays detected for seven objects , while for the remaining four a soft spectrum is detected . combining these data with photometric data from the _ hubble space telescope _<n> , we find that the fraction of agn with hard spectra increases with increasing _ rotational _ velocity of the agn , which is consistent with a scenario in which the hard spectra are produced by relativistic agn wind interaction . <n> agn activity is known to increase with stellar mass , metallicity , and ism density @xcite . in most cases<n> this is due to the formation of agb and post - agb stars , but in a few cases it is also caused by the interaction between agn and the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , e.g. by the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) or the accretion shock from the accreting the light curves of the sub -

mean - square ( rms ) amplitudes vary by more than an order of magnitude between the second and fourth peaks , indicating that the variability is dominated by non - keplerian motion of the central black holes . in the light of these results ,<n> we compare the measured rms amplitudes to those predicted by the non - relativistic boltzmann equation ( nrqe ) model . <n> the rms of the fundamental component in a narrow line is proportional to the square of the line - of - sight velocity difference , @xmath0 , between the line and the source , rather than to the redshift , as is usually assumed . however , the n we present early results from the search for supermassive black holes using the da@xmath0be black hole at the center of the large magellanic cloud .<n> we find no evidence for relativistic beaming in the early phases of the search , and use the results to set upper limits on the mass of the black hole and the apparent magnitude of the relativistic beaming . we report the discovery of the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulxr ) ngc 3998 with an orbital period of 8.7 hours .<n> the spectrum of the spectrum obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , combined with data from the _ hubble space telescope _ and _ swift_/xrt , reveals that the source is a blue supergiant with @xmath0 and no detected x - rays . we report the discovery of a binary system consisting of a blue supergiant and a red supergiant with a separation of @xmath0 .<n> the system has a common proper motion of the two stars and the binary components are almost perfectly aligned with each other , which makes the system an ideal system to study supermassive black hole ( smbh ) formation in the gravitational collapse of a massive black hole . <n> black holes are expected to form in the center of massive black holes , but their formation is still poorly understood . in the framework of smbh formation , the mass of the black hole and the initial angular momentum of the binary system are assumed to be given by the schwarzschild radius of the host galaxy , and the masses of the stars and their orbital angular momentum are calculated by assuming that the black holes have the same mass and angular momentum as the local stars . however , if the stars have different masses and orbital angular momenta , then they will have different gravitational redshifts , resulting in different smbh properties . as a result , when the stars form in a smbh configuration , they will evolve through different phases of the hertzsprung -

gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium are studied within the light - front quantization ( lbt ) model .<n> we find that the energy loss of the leading parton is logarithmically related to the energy of the initial parton in the qgp medium , which leads to a logarithmic energy dependence of the elastic energy loss for subsequent scatterings . as a result ,<n> the averaged energy loss per unit distance during multiple scattering is smaller than in a single scattering by a factor of @xmath0 . <n> parton propagation in a hot and dense qcd medium is described by the glashow - weinberg - salam ( gws ) equation @xcite . in this equation<n> , parton energy loss is assumed to be proportional to the total energy loss and to the temperature of the medium . for a parton with a small energy in a static medium at the highest temperature , its energy loss remains almost a constant even at a later time . on the other hand , for a gluon in a medium with a large energy in the lowest energy parton , the energy and the energy<n> loss are degraded with time parton propagation in a hot and dense qgp medium is studied in the light -

energy heavy - ion collisions and propagated in a medium of thermalized qcd matter at a temperature @xmath0 mev . at later times , when the temperature of the medium dropped below the deconfinement transition , the partons could no longer propagate in the medium and had to be absorbed by thermal recoil \" partons ( negative partons subtracted from the sum of the initial parton energy and momentum ) . during this process , energy was transferred to the medium , and the energy loss of the leading parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is studied in a parton transport model , which is based on the linear response theory ( lbt ) .<n> the propagation of a leading parton including both leading and thermal recoil partons in a uniform qgp medium at a constant temperature @xmath0 is described . in principle , leading and jet - induced medium partons will eventually merge and approach a thermal spectrum as a result of the equilibration , but this limit is beyond the validity of the lbt model . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] partons which are not part of the initial distribution of partons ( i.e. leading partons ) will lose energy and propagate in a medium . the energy and momentum deposited in the medium , however , will dissipate with time and propagate like a sound wave . since the leading massless parton travels at the speed of light , the sound wave induced by the propagating parton becomes supersonic . it can form a mach - cone shock wave as shown in many recent studies @xcite . simulations of jet propagation within parton transports models<n> also show similar mach - in this article , we present a study of parton spectra and jet reconstruction in a uniform quark -

interacting case . in particular , the partons from the scatterings with the medium have a much softer spectrum than the incident parton , and the ratio of their four - momenta is larger than that of incident partons in a single scattering . on the other hand , in the case with scatterings without a uniform medium , partons with a large four - momentum<n> do not have a large enough energy to be excited in a medium with a medium - free equation of state ( eos ) since the scattering is dominated by small - angle processes . to study the effect of the scattering on the propagation of parton spectra and jet reconstruction in @xmath0 annihilation are studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model with parton interactions among jet - induced thermal partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium .<n> we find that the jet reconstruction is sensitive to the initial parton transverse momentum and the initial energy of the thermal parton in the lbt model as well as to the temperature of the qgp medium , which can be tested in future experiments . <n> relativistic heavy -

induced medium parton distributions in high - energy heavy - ion collisions are sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening of leading partons propagating in a qgp medium .<n> we show that the broadening leads to a broadening of the azimuthal anisotropies of event - averaged partons , which will affect the final parton spectra . <n> the study of angular distributions of partons produced in jet - production processes has been a unique tool to probe the properties of hot and dense qcd matter at high temperatures @xcite . in the last decade<n> , parton transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distributions have been measured in a variety of different processes , such as electron - positron and proton - proton collisions , pp collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , and nucleus - nucleus collisions at fermilab . due to<n> the large transverse momentum of the produced partons in the initial collision , their transverse momentum distribution in the final collisions is expected to be strongly asymmetric , i.e. , the partons are expected to have a much broader distribution than the initial parton distribution . as a result ,<n> the we study the evolution of jet - induced parton angular distributions in high - energy heavy - ion collisions using a subtraction scheme that accounts for the angular distribution of hadrons in the underlying events .<n> we find that thermal recoil partons are the dominant contributions to the spectra at late times due to the transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton and multiple parton scatterings . <n> jet quenching is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in qcd<n> , the energy loss of a parton can be divided into two classes : energy loss due to initial parton radiation , @xmath0 , and energy loss from the back - reaction , which we refer to as parton energy loss , _<n> i.e. _ , thermal recoil _ partons . during the early time , partons from thermal recoil<n> radiation have a broad angular distribution that is similar to that of a single scattering . at later times , however , their angular distribution changes due to energy loss and multiple scatterings of the propagating parton , especially when the total energy loss becomes sizable relative to the initial final hadronic jets produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc can be approximated with partonic jets reconstructed from final partons in theoretical simulations if nonperturbative effects of parton hadronization are neglected .<n> we study the effect of the background from underlying events on the final jet energy and jet spectra within a monte carlo simulation of a light - by - light ( lbt ) model . by including both leading partons as well as jet - induced medium partons for the jet reconstruction , we find that the energy loss of reconstructed jets is reduced and the jet spectra become harder . <n> the study of the spectra of final hadrons produced in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe the properties of hot and dense matter created in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . due to the large number of nucleon - nucleon collisions that can be performed in a small center - of - mass energy range , the energy density of the matter created<n> can be significantly higher than that in proton - proton collisions , leading to the formation of a hot , dense matter , which can be described by a thermalized deconfined quark -

matter system ,<n> the energy loss of partons during their propagation through the medium is an important factor which is not included in the standard perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations . as a result of energy loss<n> the parton distribution in the evolution of gluon jets in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and baryon density is studied .<n> the study is performed in the framework of the parton model at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath0 . in the presence of a qgp medium ,<n> the partons of the qgp become strongly coupled , leading to a modification of the equation of state ( eos ) and a change of the gluon distribution in the medium . as a result<n> , a new type of medium - induced eos is observed , which is characterized by a large number of eos and leads to a significant change in the properties of qgp matter at high temperature and density . <n> the qcd phase transition is one of the most dramatic phenomena in modern physics , occurring between the deconfined phase of strong interactions and the vacuum of qcd . at high temperatures and densities , the strong interaction<n> is strongly screened , allowing for the formation of a strongly coupled qgp ( qcd with quarks and gluons ) state @xcite . due to the confinement , perturb we study the evolution of the jet transverse structure in a hot and dense quark -

matter interactions is the so - called landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , in which interference between two or more interfering modes can be suppressed or enhanced , depending on whether they are of the same or different types . in the former case ,<n> the lpm effect is associated with a local ( or global ) photon correlation , while in the latter case it arises from a global ( or , more generally , non - local ) anti - correlation . on a global scale , interference effects to the spectrum<n> are well - known to be suppressed , but it is not clear whether they can we address interference effects in bremsstrahlung from a composite target , and propose simple recipes for incorporating coulomb corrections , which give a reasonable balance between precision and simplicity for the addressed case . <n> the anti -

zero , since successive scatterings are not causally connected . as a consequence , averaging over scattering angles ( dipole limit ) yields a product of mean scattering angles , wherefore the whole interference in the spectrum in this approximation vanishes . in this paper , we will concentrate on the case of radiation on two scattering foils with definite we address the issue of large -

transfer (rt ) cross section in the thin - target limit .<n> the result is valid for arbitrary ( geometrically ) thin targets and arbitrary ( fixed - scattering - angle ) radiation spectrum . in the limit of vanishing target thickness<n> , it reduces to the well - known result of blankenbecler [ eq . <n> ( 30 ) ] . for finite - size targets ,<n> we show that the rt cross section may be expressed as a sum of two terms , one of which is linearly proportional to the radiation flux , and the other is quadratic in the flux ; the second term is non - vanishing only in the vicinity of the transition from thin to thick targets . as a consequence , for any finite number of scattering events , the cross section is finite even in the absence of ( averaged ) fixed - angle radiation ; hence , our result applies to any geometrically thin target , irrespectively of its thickness , as long as the radiation spectrum is not averaged over the target s surface , i.e. , if the target is geometrically flat and gaussian scattered . multiple coulomb scattering in thin metal targets irradiated by intense laser fields is analyzed .<n> it is shown that the approximation of blankenbecler [ j. phys . <n> a : math . theor . * 32 * , 509 ( 1974 ) ] , which is based on a double -

section of single scattering . in the extreme case of one foil @xmath0  2-1right. ] ] it is found that the scattering angle distribution can not be regarded as tenable there , provided one uses the exact small - angle expansion . baier and katkov s result for the case of two foils @xcite , and blankenbecler s correction to eq . <n> ( [ fsigma - dipole - dipole ) ) are derived , once one identifies the first - order term in the expansion , which should vary logarithmically with the thickness of the target . more accurate description of multiple coulombic scattering is furnished in the second part of the paper , in which more precise evaluation of the kinetic equation is provided . multiple scattering is one of the most important physical phenomena in thin metal foils , occurring in a wide range of experimental settings , ranging from atomic collisions @x we study the effect of the electron - electron interaction on the angular distribution of a single photon scattered by a thin metal target .<n> the electron kinetic equation is solved in terms of a fourier - bessel integral , so that the scattering angle distribution can be evaluated exactly . as a result ,<n> the angular dependence of the photon s impact parameter , @xmath0 , on the parent electron is obtained , as well as its dependence on the thickness of the target , which can be probed experimentally . <n> pacs numbers : 34.80.qb , 34.50.-s , 32.80.pj recently , there has been a growing interest in the possibility of measuring the impact parameter of single photons scattered by thin metal targets @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that the angle distribution of the scattered photon can be significantly modified by the electron s internal structure @x<n> . this may lead to significant changes in the shape of the scattering spectrum , and , consequently , to observable effects , such as the angular -

photon systems , including , but not limited to , atomic , molecular , optical , and solid - state systems . <n> it is well - known that the emission spectrum of radiation from an electron with energy lower than its mean free path is exponential @xcite . in this paper<n> we show that this result does not necessarily imply exponential suppression of the emission probability for scattering of an electron from a high - energy composite quantum system , as is the case in the case of atomic and molecular systems ; it is just the opposite , namely , exponentially suppressed for an electron scattering from an atomic or molecular system . to illustrate this<n> , we consider emission of an electromagnetic radiation by an atom with energy in the range of a few ev , which is described by the low-@xmath1 approximation of classical electrodynamics ( see also @x we present a theory of atom - radiation interaction in the framework of a phenomenological approach .<n> the approach is based on the concept of multiple scattering , that allows to take into account both ionization and excitation of an atom by radiation . as an example , we consider the interaction of an atomic beam with laser - induced fluorescence of a @xmath0rb@xmath1 state . <n> the interaction between an atom and radiation has been a subject of intense studies for a long time @xcite , both theoretically and experimentally . in the early days of quantum optics ,<n> such an interaction was described in terms of schrdinger equation ( see , e.g. , moliere , phys.rev.a , * 50 * , 3865 ( 1893 ) ) @x<n> ] . later , in the context of high - energy atom - photon interaction , the problem was formulated in the form of scattering theory ( see also glauber , j. phys . a : math . theor . *<n> 40 * ( 1991 ) l589 ) and solution of the problem by gauss - bonnet method @x gold and carbon are the two most abundant elements in the earth s crust . yet , despite their ubiquity , their fundamental properties are not well understood . in this paper<n> , we address this issue from the point of view of understanding the molecular binding effects on highland bremsstrahlung on a free atom in these two metals .<n> we show that the effect of molecular binding can be well described by the widely used empirical formula - dependence of the scattering angle , but we also present a simple , yet accurate , phenomenological approach , which allows us to estimate the effect and to predict its strength . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the properties of metals is one of the cornerstones of modern solid state physics , and plays an important role in many fields of research , ranging from atomic and molecular physics to ion - trap physics and spectroscopy . at present , most of the attention is devoted to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) properties of metallic systems , in particular to their electronic and magnetic properties @xcite , as well as to their chemical and optical properties . however , understanding of the fundamental properties of solids is still an open problem . we derive formulas for gaussian average values of the rms scattering angle in bremsstrahlung of electrons on carbon and gold surfaces .<n> they are valid in the whole range of electron scattering angles , including coulomb corrections , and can be applied to both single and multiple scattering experiments . in the case of two plates ,<n> our approach is equivalent to the recipe of baier and katkov [ phys . <n> . lett . * 90 * , 085001 ( 2003 ) ] , which accounts for multiple scattering in a rigorous way . for comparison , the widely used empirical formula - dependence of the coefficient is known to work only with an accuracy better than 10% for single scattering , but is not applicable in the multiple - scattering case , where the coulombic nature of electron - electron interaction leads to nontrivial contributions from each plate . as a result , we find that the average value of rms electron scattering angle should be evaluated with a precision better than @xmath0 , in order to describe the behavior of electrons in the vicinity of a metal surface , as observed in many experiments , such as electron diffraction , x - ray we present a general prescription for the calculation of currents and current - phase correlations in mesoscopic scatterers .<n> the prescription is valid for arbitrary scattering angles , provided that the scattering is axially - symmetric , i.e. , it can be expressed in terms of a single distribution function . in the case of two or more scatterers<n> , the prescription reduces to a single - channel form , which can be evaluated numerically . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the problem of scattering of light by dielectric surfaces has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite , both from a theoretical and a practical point of view . the interest is twofold : first , to understand the scattering mechanism , and second , because it is central to the field of nanophotonics , where it is crucial for the success of nanoelectronics devices , as well as for the development of efficient optical filters . for the latter purpose ,<n> it is essential to know how to calculate the scattering angle distribution function @xmath0 , from which the scattering currents can be extracted . to this end , a number of approaches have been developed , starting with the well - we develop a semiclassical theory of the azimuthally averaged radiative decay of @xmath0 , which is free of the backscattering catastrophe that afflicts all diffractive decays .<n> we show that , contrary to conventional wisdom , the amplitude decays as a power of the angle of incidence , with an exponent that depends on the scattering angle . as a result ,<n> the decay rate is a nonmonotonic function of angle , in contrast to diffractively decaying modes , whose decay rate depends only on the angle at which the radiation is emitted . <n> _ introduction. _ <n> the problem of the decay of a weakly interacting quantum particle ( wimp ) is central to many areas of modern physics , including high - energy particle and nuclear physics @xcite , ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @x<n> . one of the most important issues in these fields is the nature of the underlying interaction between the wimp and the detector . in the case of grbs<n> , it is well known that the interaction can not be described by a classical wave function , since it we study electromagnetic radiation from a pair of half - lines in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .<n> we show that the radiation from the first half - line is dominated by the quadrupole approximation , whereas that from the second half line is smeared by the azimuthal averaging . for large scattering angles ,<n> the latter radiation amplitude is suppressed , and the electromagnetic current at one scattering is proportional to @xmath0 . <n> the study of electromagnetic radiation has a long history . in the early days of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , it was realized that the electromagnetic field can be described by a set of dirac fermions coupled to a system of linearly - coupled klein - gordon ( kfg ) equations . since then , the problem has been reduced to a series of coupled kfg equations , which have been solved in a variety of situations , ranging from the problem of electron - hole plasmas in the strong - coupling regime @x<n> . one of the most important results was the dipole - dipole approximation ( dda ) for the kfg equation , in which the electric current is a sum of two terms  we study electromagnetic bremsstrahlung from a relativistically expanding plasma .<n> we find that the radiation spectrum is suppressed in the high - density regime , where the electromagnetic current is dominated by the quadrupole component of the electromagnetic field . in the low - density limit , however , the spectrum is found to oscillate with the increase of the density , which is a signature of saturation of radiation . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of relativistic plasmas more than half a century ago @xcite , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of their properties , both for fundamental and applied reasons . among them , plasma physics has been a driving force in establishing the foundations of quantum mechanics , as well as in the development of general principles of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , such as the relativistic time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and the boltzmann - vlasov equation ( mvle ) @xmath0 , to name only a few . at the heart of these developments<n> is the concept of the vacuum state , i.e. , an electromagnetic analogue of the plasma vacuum . since the vacuum we study the propagation of light through a medium consisting of two parallel plates separated by a finite distance .<n> the bremsstrahlung spectrum of the incident light is computed for gaussian scattering - angle distribution functions , and the dependence of the spectrum on the distance between the plates is shown to exhibit an anti - localization - phase - locking ( anti - lpm ) effect . in the case of two foils ,<n> the spectrum is found to oscillate with the increase of the distance , as anticipated . <n> _ introduction._@xmath0 light propagates through media , whether it is a liquid , a gas , or a solid . at a distance @xmath1 from a surface<n> , the intensity of a light beam is proportional to its mean free path , i.e. , to the area of the beam . as a consequence , in the absence of a medium , there is no interaction between light and matter , except for the case when it propagates along a closed path ( for example , through a magnetic field ) @xcite . on the other hand , when a medium is transparent to light , it is possible to it is shown that anti - phase - shift ( anti - lpm ) in optical interferometers can be enhanced by a spectral shift of half wavelength , which can be interpreted as a half - wavelength shift of the interference pattern .<n> the result is valid for arbitrary shape of the distribution function @xmath0 , and for arbitrary distance between the plates . <n> [ [ section ] ] the concept of optical interference has been introduced by bernoulli @xcite , in the spirit of wave optics , to describe the interference of two optical beams under the action of some external field . in the same spirit , it is natural to expect that interference effects between two beams should be anti - stationary , i.e. , they can not be reversed by some external force . as it is well - known , that is , when the forces acting on the beams differ from each other in such a way that the total force is zero , then the interference between the beams vanishes . on the other hand ,<n> it is also known that if the forces are equal to each other , there is a counter - interference effect , namely , if two beams are decoupled  it is shown that in the resonance condition @xmath0 , the scattering amplitude completely factorizes from the scattering one , and so radiation on two plates becomes the same as on one plate with the aggregate thickness .<n> it is also shown that the in - medium coherence length in application to the present problem leads to a large underestimate of the location of the first spectral maximum . <n> pacs numbers : 42.25.bs , 42.50.ct , 42.65.ky , 78.67.-n the scattering theory @xcite is a powerful tool in the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter . in particular , it is well known that in a resonant condition , such a situation when the radiation amplitude completely factorsizes from a scattering one can be realized . however , in practice , there is no such situation , because in most cases one has to employ the coherence length , which is numerically too large . on the other hand ,<n> in resonant conditions , one may employ the coherent length . here<n> , we will show that this procedure leads to an _ unjustified _ use of this length and to a pronounced _ minimum _ next to we derive asymptotics of the quadrupole operator @xmath0 in the limit of large angles .<n> it is expressed in terms of the green s function of the scattering problem , which can be easily evaluated numerically . as an application<n> , we derive small- and large-@xmath1 asymptotics for the unit step function of a model of interacting bosons . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.ge , 11.10.lm , 05.30.jp in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of the interaction of light with matter . in condensed matter physics ,<n> the problem is closely related to the one of the electroweak interaction between a pair of bosons @xcite , such as in a bose -

monopole interaction in a system of spinless fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions is described by a non - linear sigma model .<n> the latter is shown to exhibit quadrupolar behavior in vicinity of the origin , but diverges beyond a critical value , @xmath0 , at which point the system undergoes a phase transition to a monopole - dominated phase . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 11.10.lm , 05.30.fk in recent years , the problem of the phase transition in monolayer graphene has attracted a lot of attention . in the context of graphene , a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice ,<n> is considered to form the honeycomb lattice of graphene @xcite . at the same time , in the framework of classical electrodynamics ( e.g. , see , for example , ref.@xcite and references therein ) , there is a well - known problem of quantization of the monopole field of a charged particle in the presence of a magnetic field . on the other hand , from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics<n> , quadru it is shown that the radiative transfer on the light front between a black hole ( bh ) and a detector may be described by a two - dimensional free schrdinger equation on a curved surface .<n> the equation is solved for a bh irradiated by an intense laser beam , and the resulting radiation spectrum is presented . <n> bh - photon interaction on a light front is one of the most important physical processes in the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) . in the early days of rhic @xcite , it was considered as a possible source for the so - called  knee '' of the cosmic ray spectrum at @xmath0 ev , which was later found to be due to synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated in the relativistic jet . as a result ,<n> the knee was interpreted as a signature of relativistic effects in the rhic radiation spectrum . since then<n> , the knee has been interpreted as due to the interaction of the relativistic electron beam with a dense medium , as was first discussed in ref . (<n> [ eq : knee ] ) in the context of the ion - electron collision in the atmosphere , or in the collision of we show that the interference of light and matter on a light front , as described by a two - dimensional free schrdinger equation , can be expressed in terms of a green s function .<n> this allows one to derive the interference spectrum , which is found to depend only on the difference between impact parameters , not on the impact parameter difference itself . as an application<n> , we show how the interference in the case of a light - matter interaction can be related to the spectrum of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in semiconductor devices . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /-0.5 in the past few years , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in semiconductor nanostructures . in this context ,<n> one of the most important questions is the nature of the wave - particle interaction , and how it is affected by the structure of the material , the incident field and the geometry of the incident light beam @xcite . to this end , it is of interest to understand how the wave properties change when the material is changed from a semiconductor to a metal , or from a metal to a semiconductor and back . we derive the spectrum of radiation emitted by an object moving at a constant velocity , under the influence of an external force field , on a plate of arbitrary thickness .<n> we show that the spectrum is a function of three variables : the impact parameter , the velocity of the object , and the thickness of the plate . in the limit of a large impact parameter @xmath0<n> , we evaluate the spectrum to second order in the impact - parameter difference . for small impact parameters ,<n> the result is equivalent to the well - known gaussian approximation . <n> radiation from charged particles moving at constant velocity has been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally , since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . as a consequence of the lagrangian formulation of the problem , it is generally assumed that the particle velocity is a free parameter and that the effect of the force field is negligible , except in the case of a collision with a solid body . since the advent of high - intensity x - ray scattering ( xsr ) , in which the x - rays are produced by relativistic electrons moving in the vacuum of a plasma , this approximation has been extended to the case where the we show that the visibility of the low-@xmath0 dip in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a plate can be used to determine the scattering angle of light .<n> this is possible because the interference between the scattered light and the incoming radiation is substantially reduced at the edges of the plate , where it is most pronounced . in this way<n> , the low - frequency part of the spectrum can be discriminated from that of the incoming light , and vice versa . <n> [ [ introduction.- ] ] introduction .- + +<n> + + ++ + + - + + radiation from an object that is irradiated with a frequency @xmath1 , such as a mirror , a plate or an atom , is usually scattered by a beam of light with a scattering angle that is a function of the incident wavelength @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the intensity of the scattered radiation depends on the angle , which can be expressed in terms of the _ angle of incidence _ ( ao ) , defined as the angle between the incident and the outgoing beams . for a single object , however , there is a _<n> dip _ in the intensity spectrum we consider the low-@xmath0 radiation from a two - dimensional array of strongly scattering foils , in the limit of small @xmath1 .<n> the spectrum of interference fringes is computed exactly , as a function of the foil - foil separation , and compared with that from blankenbecler s theory . for large separations<n> , the two theories give essentially the same results . <n> [ sec : aggr - spectr ] in this paper , we study interference fringes in the low - energy radiation from two strongly scattering plates . in the case of a single plate of aggregate thickness ,<n> this can be done explicitly , using the terminology from optics . as a result , it is shown that the interference spectrum of low-,mid- and high - energy photons from such a system can be given by a simple formula , which is essentially identical to that from the well - known , exact , solution of the scattering problem in optics @xcite . however , here the spectrum is reduced to that of radiation from one plate , rather than from a single foil . to be specific , there is only one free parameter in our theory , it is shown that in the limit of large number of photons per second ( @xmath0 ) , molire s theory of radiation averaging becomes inaccurate , just where the accuracy of approximation itself becomes worse than 10% . on the other hand , the visibility may be characterized by the ratio of actual visibility to the level of a few percent , demanding formidable measurement statistics .<n> that means that under the conditions of cancellation of dipole contributions in the interference , fluctuations help creating uncompensated contributions . <n> _ introduction : _ radiation averaging ( ra ) @xcite is a powerful tool for modeling the interference effect in radiation , especially in the high - intensity region , where ra is of the order of a percent . yet , in practice , it is very difficult to achieve such a high level of accuracy , due to the following two reasons : ( i ) the required statistics for the measurements is very demanding , requiring formidable measurement numbers ; ( ii ) in the absence of fluctuations , ra is approximation - free , i.e. , its predictions are independent of the details of the model . in this paper<n> , we will show that the approximation we study visibility of high-@xmath0 minima and maxima in the lepton sector of the standard electroweak model .<n> we show that the predictions of lepton radiation formfactors , which are obtained by averaging over the molire distribution , differ significantly from the exact results . <n> lepton - nucleus collisions play an important role in the standard model ( s ) of particle physics . in its simplest form ,<n> the s model is governed by the electroweak interaction between a quark and an antiquark , i.e. , by @xmath1 , where the number of nucleons in the nucleus @xcite , the coupling constant @x<n> , and the mass of the quark , respectively , are @x , s and ( anti)quark constants . at high energies , ( i )<n> the interaction is mediated by the electromagnetic ( em ) dipole moment of the photon , while ( ii ) the electromagnetic dipole moments of protons and electrons are of the same order . as a result , in the em theory , electromagnetic radiation form factors ( erf ) are proportional to the we study the effect of fluctuations of scattering in the large-@xmath0 region on the visibility of interference fringes in electromagnetic radiation from two metallic foils .<n> we show that in the region of substantial photon energies , the account of fluctuations tends to suppress the interference effect , whereas for smaller energies fluctuations tend to increase it . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , there has been a growing interest in the possibility to observe interference fringes from electromagnetic radiation , in particular , from two metal foils @xcite . in this letter , we deal with the case , when both foils are metallic , i.e. , they are made of the same material , but they are separated by a distance @xmath1 , that is much larger than the wavelength of the incident photon , namely , it is much smaller than the  scattering '' distance between the two foils in units of the atomic distance , which is of the order of a few hundred nanometers , as far as we are concerned . as we will see in the following , this is not the case in general , and in fact , even in the case when the scattering blankenbecler - drell and sigma [ phys . rev . lett . * 84 * , 2993 ( 2000 ) ] recently suggested that the visibility of the quadrupole - quadrupolar interference fringes in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at half -

temperature limits . at low temperature ,<n> the behavior of quarks and gluons is governed by the bcs theory , while at high temperature the qcd - inspired bcs - bethe - salpeter ( bss ) approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is used . for both cases , it is well known that the low -

to - transverse dispersion relations are no more proportional to the temperature @xmath0 , but rather depend on a small-@xmath1 correction . we show that this correction leads to a strong suppression of the transverse and longitudinal plasson modes , as well as to a large contribution due to the decay of gluons into particle - holes , in comparison to the leading - order result . <n> the plasmo is one of the fundamental excitations in the qgp and plays an important role in the phenomenology of heavy - ion collisions at rhic , lhc , and nlc . at high energy and low momentum transfer , it is described by the dispersion relation of it is well known that the weak coupling constant @xmath0 and the quark masses are important for the electroweak symmetry breaking .<n> however , it is still an open question whether the quarks of the present quark -

interaction problem in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) @xcite . due to the large number of degrees of freedom in these collisions , the problem can be reduced to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) equation of state ( eos ) , which can be solved by the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd)-based approach . for a given system of quarks and gluons , in order to solve this eos properly , one needs we show that plasmon excitations of the quark - gluon plasma can be calculated in the framework of an imbalanced quark system .<n> the transverse and longitudinal plasmonic modes of the plasma are identified and their plasma frequency is calculated . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.mh , 12.39.ba , 24.85.+p , 25.75.-q _ introduction : _ it is well - known that the ideal - gas behavior of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low temperatures is strongly influenced by the behavior of the gluon propagator @xcite . in particular , the landau pole @xmath0 , which is the maximum of the momentum - space distribution of gluons in the vacuum , plays an important role in the low - temperature behavior of qcd as it gives rise to a maximum in the thermodynamic potential density of the theory . on the other hand ,<n> it is not the only factor that plays a role for the large-@xmath1 behavior , as also the vacuum becomes increasingly dominant in the limit of vanishing gluon thermal mass . as a consequence<n> , it is natural to ask we study the thermodynamic properties of an ideal quark - antiquark gas in the coulomb and lorentz gauges .<n> we show that the leading - order rpa correction to the thermodynamic potential density is the ideal - gas contribution of a two - flavor imbalanced quark system , while the next - to - leading order correction is the stefan - boltzmann law of a ideal bose gas . in the low - temperature limit ,<n> the quark gas is a perfect fluid with the temperature and the chemical potential equal to @xmath0 , where the rpa corrections are evaluated in closed form . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.mh , 12.39.ba , 24.85.+p in recent years , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of quark systems at finite temperature and density @xcite , and to the construction of effective field theories to describe them . among these<n> , the perturbative qcd is the most successful , as it has the lowest - energy coupling constants and the lowest quark masses , which makes the theory a good candidate for describing low - energy hadronic systems . however , the transverse momentum @xmath0 and rapidity distribution of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are calculated at finite temperature and baryon density .<n> we show that the leading - order @xcite and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the elliptic flow and to the ratio of transverse to longitudinal rapidity density are anomalously enhanced and suppressed , respectively , compared to the predictions of the ideal gas model . in particular , we find that the nlo qcd correction to the transverse - momentum distribution is anomalously suppressed at high baryon densities , while it is enhanced at low baryonic densities . <n> the study of rapidity distributions of hadrons produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions provides a powerful tool to test the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and to search for new phenomena beyond the sm , such as quark and gluon confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . while the experimental data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory are in good agreement with the sm predictions , it is not yet clear whether or not the we study the leading - order @xmath0 corrections to the longitudinal and transverse gluon self - energies at small temperatures ( t@xmath1 ) and small momenta , which are due to particle - hole creation and theta function terms , respectively . for the imbalanced case , we find that these terms are of the same order of magnitude as the analytic results for the small- and small - t corrections obtained in ref . <n> @xcite .<n> we also find that the leading- and next - to - leading order corrections are proportional to the square of the temperature , with a coefficient which depends on the sign of the imaginary part of the self - energy of the thermal gluons . at low temperatures and/or large momenta the gluon field acquires a non - vanishing imaginary part due to thermal plasmon modes . as a result<n> , thermal gluon production and decay can be suppressed . in the ideal gas approximation ,<n> this effect is described by the following term in the effective lagrangian : the imaginary parts of the energies and momenta of the longitudinal ( transverse ) gluons and of the transverse gluons are proportional , where the first term is the specific heat of hot and dense hadronic matter at finite temperature and density is calculated in the weak coupling approximation .<n> the results are compared with the recent numerical results for the transverse gluon selfenergy at small @xmath0 and @xcite . at high temperatures ,<n> we find good agreement with the analytic results obtained in ref.@xcite for the small-@xmath1 corrections to the analytic expression for the gluon - gluon scattering length . <n> the thermodynamic properties of hadronic and quark matter at high temperature are of great interest for several reasons . in particular , it is of great importance to understand the behavior of the gluonic degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the phase transition from the hadronic to the quark phase , which is expected to occur at temperatures of the order of the critical temperature of qcd ( or higher ) . for this reason , in recent years , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of the low - energy effective theories of the qcd phase transition , especially in the framework of the schwinger - dyson - schwinger ( sdss ) approach . among these effective theories<n> , one of the most we study the thermodynamics of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we show that the qgp can be described in the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) formalism , which allows us to calculate the specific heat and the effective mass in the high - density , low - temperature , and small-@xmath0 limits . in the weak - coupling expansion ,<n> we find that the lgw effective mass is suppressed by the first landau parameter , @xmath1 , due to the mixing of the two quark flavors . <n> the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter at finite density and temperature have been of great interest since the early days of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . since the first predictions of landau s equations for a strongly interacting gas in the early universe , a great deal of work has been done to understand the behavior of such a system in the thermodynamic limit , when the temperature is much less than the debye temperature of the gas and the density is small compared to the temperature at which qcd sets in . of particular interest<n> is the question of we study the large-@xmath0 limit of a cold dense two - flavor imbalanced quark system , which is expected to be realized at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> we calculate the thermodynamic potential perturbatively and the effective mass of the quarks is determined by using fermi - liquid theory . for the case of two flavors<n> , we also calculate the specific heat within the weak - coupling limit , and numerically within the rpa approximation . we find that , due to the screening of the electric gluons at long wavelength , the logarithmic temperature dependence of the specific - heat and effective - mass signals a breakdown of fermi liquid theory at zero - temperature . <n> quark - quark interactions are expected to play an important role in the deconfinement phase transition of the strongly - interacting quark matter at high temperatures @xcite . in the absence of inter - flavor interactions ,<n> the quark mass is believed to be independent of each other , so that each flavor should be treated as independent of the other . however , in the presence of flavor imbalance , this is no longer the case , because different quark flavors we discuss the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat and effective mass in the large-@xmath0 limit of three - flavor qcd .<n> the logarithmic behavior in the balanced case has previously been seen in analytic and numerical calculations of the qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat using group theory factors , dimensional reduction , and hard - dense loop qcd perturbation theory . <n> we expect that such a logarithmic dependence shall have important effects on the imbalanced qcd phase diagram at low temperatures and directly influence the properties of quark matter in the core of neutron stars . the wick- and wick - rotated cases of the relativistic dirac equation are studied .<n> it is shown that the spinors of the dirac operator in momentum space are related to the eigenvalues of the euclidean charge - conjugation matrix by a completeness relation . in both cases<n> the spin -

magnetic ( cm ) and chromo - electric ( ce ) effects . here<n> we will by performing a wick rotation , a quantum field theory can be transformed into a statistical field theory .<n> this transformation is carried out in euclidean space and all tensors are obtained in terms of their minkowski definitions . the partition function<n> is then calculated and is shown to be finite . <n> quantum field theories are useful tools for the analysis of experimental data . in particular , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , which describes the behavior of quarks and gluons in the high energy limit , is an example of a field theory that is well described by statistical field theories ( sfts ) . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> qcd is a very simple and well defined quantum theory , but it suffers from a number of theoretical problems , most notably the so -

isomorphic to a finite set . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the lambda chains ( lcs ) were introduced by john von neumann @xcite in order to study the structure of the weyl group generated by the reflection of the associated lambda chain on the associated riemann surface . for a finite weight ,<n> the lc is defined by the weight of an admissible subset , which is called the lambda - weight of the admissible subset ( see proposition [ lc - weight - isomorphism ] ) . a lambda - chain ( or , more generally , an associated sequence of integers ) is called a lambda , after jacques alonso , john w. andrade in this paper , we introduce a combinatorial model for folded complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras . in this model ,<n> we decompose tensor products of irreducible representations , and we give a branching rule for tensor products . we introduce a combinatorial model for roots systems for complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras .<n> it generalizes the model in our previous paper @xcite , and specializes to it in the finite case . in this paper<n> , we prove that our model satisfies stembridge s axioms for admissible systems , which are axioms in the theory of roots systems . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain character formulas , a littlewood - richardson rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations , as well as a branching rule . we prove that the weyl group @xmath0 of a complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebra is finite if and only if the corresponding crystallographic root system is a root system of semisimple lie algebra .<n> more generally , we prove the finiteness of weyl groups of root systems of lie algebras whose representations are complex weyl or coxeter groups . <n> the paper @xcite is devoted to the study of the structure of representations of finite root systems . in that paper<n> , it was shown that if the root systems are rooted in a finite - dimensional vector space with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form , then their representations are in one - to - one correspondence with the representations of the corresponding finite root system . as a consequence ,<n> one obtains a notion of representation for the root system in question , which is in many ways similar to the notion of a representation of a lie algebra in general , and in particular , of a semisimple algebra in particular<n> . however , there is a fundamental difference between the two types of representations : in the first case , the representation is a lie group , while in the second case it is a we prove that the weyl group @xmath0 is finite if and only if the lattice of ( integral ) weights is _ linearly independent _ , that is , the set of positive roots in the nonnegative linear span of the simple roots satisfies the _ bruhat order _ on the lattice . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the study of weyl groups has a long history , going back to the work of zelevinsky @xcite .<n> however , it was not until the turn of the century that we had a group - theoretic approach to the subject , and the first results about finite groups were obtained in the 1920 s . in this paper<n> , we will give a new perspective on finite groups , based on the notion of _ lattice of weights_.<n> we will show that if the  fundamental weights '' of the lattice are _ positive _ ( i.e. , they are in _ nonnegative _ span ) , then we can associate a _ finite weyl subgroup _ to each lattice vector in v , such that the group is  finitely generated '' , in which case we prove that every irreducible representation of the kac - moody algebra of fundamental weights @xmath0 in @xcite is a representation of a certain ring of characters .<n> more precisely , we show that there is a correspondence between the tits cones of the fundamental weights and the characters of the corresponding ring of formal sums , that is , a correspondence that is analogous to the one between the commutative algebras of fundamental and fundamental weights . in the case<n> that the ring of sums is finitely generated , this correspondence is given in terms of the lattice of ( integral ) weights , which is the lattice generated by the fundamental weight set . as an application<n> we obtain a new proof of a result of saffman , steinmetz , and weiss on the finiteness of the jacobi polynomial . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the _ jacobian polynomial _ is the riemannian invariant of a finite dimensional lie algebra , defined as the product of two lie algebras , one of which is invariant under the action of the lie algebra on the other . for a class of lie algebra representations ,<n> in this paper , we define a ring of formal sums which contains the formal power series ring of highest weight @xmath0 for the corresponding kac - moody algebra .<n> we show that this ring is a subring of a larger ring , which we call the _ crystal ring _ , and we prove that it is a well - defined member of the ring of admissible systems . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] a ring is called _ admissible _ if it can be shown that every admissible system is a crystal , that is , it satisfies axioms ( a0 ) and ( a4 ) . a system is called an admissible system if it is integrable in the sense of kac and moody @xcite . for an integrable system ,<n> the character of its integrable module is defined in terms of the character formula of the corresponding ( kac , moody ) algebra ; see for example ( * ?<n> ? ? * section 1 ) for the case of integrable kac algebras . in this note<n> we prove a ring - theoretic result on admissible systems which is a generalization of the result of @x<n> . we develop a theory of _ crystals _ , i.e. , 4-tuples @xmath0 whose elements satisfy certain axioms .<n> we call a system _ semiperfect _ if it satisfies the same axioms as the crystal , but only finitely many of them . in this paper , we prove that a crystal is semiperfect if and only if its generating series is a well - defined member of the finite - dimensional _ bidisk _<n> , that is , the set of points on the real line whose zeros form a _ string _ through the action of the generating series . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction.<n> _ the study of crystals is one of the oldest and best - studied topics in mathematics . for many years , it has been thought to be a difficult problem to generalize the theory of crystals to the case of arbitrary real numbers , let alone to formulate a theory in which the order of the objects is taken into account . however , this is not the case in general , and it is not even clear how to treat the problem in a general way . even in the simplest case , we prove a kac - weyl - type character formula for crystals .<n> the formula is a generalization of the character formula in @xcite , but here we provide a simpler proof . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the character formulas of kac and weyl have been the subject of much debate since their introduction in the 1950 s . in their famous paper @xmath0 , we proved the existence of character formulas for crystals with a certain symmetry , and we conjectured that the same symmetry should hold for other classes of crystals , in particular , for _ perfect _ or _ semiperfect _ crystals : _ a system with a maximum number of defects of which all but one are defects of the same defect is _ perfectly _ crystallizable , _ i.e. _ the system can be prepared in such a way that all defects of one defect are also defects of another defect . the proof was based on a _ character formula _ , a concept that was introduced by kac in his study of _ order - disorder _ phenomena . since then , there have been many attempts to define character formulas , some of which we prove that the @xmath0 weyl group admits a family of maximal objects , each of which is a non - empty set of weyl characters .<n> in particular , we show that the family of semiperfect crystals has a maximal object . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the notion of a semiperfect crystal was introduced in @xcite to describe crystals that are perfect in some sense , but not in others . in this paper<n> we prove a generalization of this notion to systems that are not perfect in every sense . to do this ,<n> we introduce a new class of systems which we call maximal admissible systems , and we prove several results about their structure . the main idea in the proof<n> is to show that any system in this class admits at least one maximal object and that this maximal object is a weyl character . as a corollary<n> , it follows that any finite dimensional system admits at most two maximal objects with respect to the partial order generated by all partial orders , where the order of the partial orders is determined by the weight of the system . [<n> [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + /-#1-.4em /-.1em.4 in this paper , we show that the set of positive weyl characters ( relative to a given dominant weight @xmath0 ) of a directed colored graph can be decomposed into a sum of weyl sequences .<n> in particular , given a branching rule for weyl character decomposition , one can define on a directed graph the structure of a partition of the set into _ weyl chains _ , i.e. , sequences of positive roots , indexed by the elements of some totally ordered set , which satisfy the following properties : 1 . <n> the number of occurrences of any given triple of roots is bounded from above by the numbers of triples of roots of the same index ; 2 . given any triple of these triples ,<n> the corresponding cardinalities are bounded from below by the cardinalities of the triples themselves ; 3 . a sequence of positive _ roots _<n> is a map from an ordered set to some other set . in this work<n> we will show that if one encodes the weyl representation of a kac - moody algebra in terms of a _ crystal graph _ with crystal structure , then one can decompose the corresponding partition set into a in this paper , we prove the existence of @xmath0-_chains _ of roots , which are sequences of positive roots indexed by the elements of a totally ordered set . <n> [ lambda - chain ] a lambda chain is a chain of roots such that the sum of the number of occurrences of any two given positive roots is equal to their sum .<n> the notion of a lambdachain was introduced by john von neumann @xcite , who was motivated by the study of chains of roots ( _ root systems _ ) in the context of lambda calculus . in this context , a root system is defined as the set of all simple roots of a certain order , and a chain ( or lambda ) of roots is a sequence of such roots . a chain is called a _ lambda chain _ if it is defined by a root that is a positive vector , i.e. , it has a positive coefficient in the lexicographic order of the underlying root system . we will consider the case when the vector of roots in the chain is proportional to the coefficient of the vector in the roots of the system , as well as the case where the coefficients of the roots are we prove the existence of @xmath0-chains for any total order on the product of two lambdas .<n> we also show that such chains can be constructed as concatenations of pairs of total orders . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ [ introduction ] ] the study of lambda chains is one of the oldest and best studied topics in lambda calculus . for a complete description of a lambda chain ,<n> see @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider the case when only positive and both negative coroots are present . given two positive coroots in the unit interval , it is natural to ask whether there exists a non - empty set of coroots such that the total order induced by the addition of these two coroots induces a finite sequence of lambdachains , i.e. , a lambdachain . to this end , let us recall the definition of a ( lambda)chain as follows : given the induced total order , define a map from the set of all coroots of the lambda chain to the total set of the other coroots . also , given a coroots triple ( in any order ) , fix a triple of positive co in this paper , we study the interlacing property of rational numbers , which is a fundamental question in rational number theory .<n> it is shown that the rational numbers can be interlaced into a finite sequence if and only if their coefficients satisfy certain conditions . <n> [ theore]*theorem * [ theorr]_lemma _ [ theo]proposition [ theos]corollary [ theoro]definition [ thero]_problem _ the study of the sequences of numbers is one of the most important problems in rational numbers theory , and has been investigated by many authors . among them , e.g. , @xcite , s. haglund s problem ( 1996 ) , z. bai , y. bianchi , m. bertozzi , j. braunstein , r. beck , g. cortese , p. de wilde , f. kirchhoff , c. p. agrawal , w. ernzerhof , h. eberly , a. zeilinger , x. chen , l in this paper , we show that a @xmath0-chain is the union of a finite number of chains with the same length and the same type of coupling .<n> we also show that , in the case of a general finite root system , there is an interlacing condition , which is equivalent to the well - known skorokhod - mikhailov inequality . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem)conjecture [ theorem ]proposition the study of the behavior of a chain with respect to its length is one of the basic problems in the theory of random dynamical systems . in the 1960 s ,<n> s. selman @xcite showed that a chain is a union of finitely many chains , each of which has a different length , if the chain is spanned by a finite set of vectors . as a consequence of this result<n> , it is well known that the length of a sequence of random chains is bounded from above by its length in the limit of infinite chains . on the other hand , for a finite chain , the value of the chain s length is not bounded from below by its value in the we prove a new interlacing condition for lambda chains , which implies a chain - folding construction for the @xmath0-string .<n> in particular , we show that for a large class of lambda chains with folding condition , one can construct a lambda chain whose folded length is equal to the length of the folded string . <n> the lambda chain construction @xcite is a powerful tool in lambda theory : it is the first step in the construction of a large family of lambda - theoretical models , and in the study of their properties . in particular<n> , it provides a framework for studying the structure of the lambda - theory limit of a given theory , as well as for proving the existence of new models of this type . as an example of a model of this kind , consider the lambda theory limit ( the limit of the theory obtained by folding the folded length of a lambda - string ) : in this limit , the theory is completely determined by the geometry of the chain , while the folding of the length is given by the total number of elements of the string , i.e. , by the number of positive integers in the lambda bound . for a general theory<n> this number is in this article , we introduce a new method for involution on the set of coroots of a fixed dominant integral weight .<n> we use this method to prove that a fixed integral weight @xmath0 can be decomposed as the sum of two coroots , one of which is in the dominant weight , the other in an arbitrary integral weight chain . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ sec : introduction ] the study of the geometry of integral weights has a long and illustrious history . among many important contributions ,<n> e.g. the work of gauss , thurston , and others @xcite , integral weights have been used to prove the main conjectures of quantum mechanics , such as the conjecture that the massless modes of a qubit are the same as the massive modes of the state of the qubit . in this paper , using a new involution called the _ folding operator _ , which we introduce in section [ sec : foldings ] , as well as a new approach to the induction hypothesis for a dominant weight<n> , it is possible to prove these conjectures in a relatively simple way . as an in this paper , we study the _ level sequences _ , which are the involutions on the set of foldings ( or equivalently , the level sequences of the foldings ) that are associated to a given root system .<n> the level sequence is defined by associating to each pair in a folding an integer , and we call the corresponding index in @xmath0 a _<n> level sequence_. we show that if the root system is infinite , then level sequences are _ finite _ objects ; in fact , they are always infinite . in order to prove our main result ,<n> we characterize the set , or set of _ folding positions , _ of a system that is _ affine _ in the sense that every folding of the system is determined by the set ( or set ) . <n> [ theorem]corollary [ theorem)lemma [ theorem ]proposition [ section ] [ theorem_definition ] the study of invariants plays an important role in the theory of dynamical systems . for instance , it is a fundamental topic of interest to understand the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors we prove that the number of roots in @xmath0-chains of rank @xxmath1 is strictly less than or equal to the rank of the corresponding _ weighted _ chain .<n> more precisely , we show that the following inequality holds : given any finite chain , there is a point in the quotient hyperplane such that for each point @xcite , the sum of the weights of all roots in the corresponding chain is at least @x . <n> [ sec : lambdachains ] let us recall that the _ hausdorff distance _ between two points on the unit circle is the product of their summands , and let us state our main result as follows . given any sequence of roots ,<n> let us define a _ weight _ of the chain ; the weight is defined to be the difference of the sums of the roots of the sequence . in this paper<n> we prove the following dichotomy . on the one hand , if we fix a value of the weight , then there are roots for which the sum is zero ; on the other hand if we set the weight to zero and fix the weight ( but do not fix the value ) in this paper , we prove a special case of a conjecture of haglund , li , and sli [ _ j .<n> math . <n> phys . a _ , 2015 , * 40 * , 3966 ] , which asserts that the hausdorff distance between two euclidean distances of length @xmath0 is at most twice the length of the intersection of the first and second finitely generated segments of a lambda chain . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a lower bound on the number of iterations needed to construct a chain with a given number of crossings . in the special case<n> considered here , this bound is sharp ; in fact , it is sharp in the case of chains of length at most two , even though the bound is asymptotically sharp for chains of longer length . for the proof<n> , our model is the hamiltonian quantum chain , whose action on the field of hamiltonians is given by the action of the jacobian on the set of all compactly supported affine subspaces of the line bundle over the real line , as defined in [ s : quantum chains  let @xmath0 be a positive integer .<n> we prove that there is a one -

interacting _ particles in the plane , with the same ( positive or negative ) position and velocity as the particles of the other particle species . the well - known eigenvalue problem asks for the minimum number of particles of a certain type that are required to make the equation well - posed in the given hilbert space . for a complete answer to this problem ,<n> see e.g. refs . @x let @xmath0 be a chain .<n> we prove that , if @xcite , the counting function on the set of points of a point in the plane is given by the sum of two terms , one of which is a correction term in the formula for the total number of points in the chain ; the other is a count of the number of zeros of the chain in the direction normal to the plane . as an application<n> , we show that the following is equivalent : if the weight of the zeros in the vector space of the two - point function is zero , then there exists a non - zero vector in the space of all such zeros ; moreover , there is a vector in this space , which we call the  fixed vector '' , whose counting function is equal to that of the fixed vector . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is in the spirit of the paper , by the first author and the second author ( with the help of the third author ) , on the counting functions of two -

hand side of the origin is equal to the sum of the numbers of maximally embedded eigenvalues of the haar measure on this right - handed side . as a consequence<n> , we obtain that the partition function of the interval between two points on the left and the right of a point of the projection of a chain on this side is equal ( up to a constant factor ) to the product of the partition functions of these two points . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite . in the first part of this paper ,<n> we will prove that if the _ adm _ partition function is , up to an additive constant , the same as that of a partition function , then there exists a _<n> unique _ continuous piecewise -

key of semistandard young tableaux ( which was defined by lascoux - schtzenberger ) and which is relevant to _ demazue characters_. in particular , in this paper , we will show that there is a one - to -

indeed , the criterion is intrinsic in the sense that it only depends on the definition of the chain and is independent of it . as a consequence , <n> we get the second covering relation in [ chain2 ] by ( ( ( 3 and 4 in this paper , we study the crystal structure of a fixed @xmath0-timing chain , which is obtained by folding a large class of foldings .<n> we prove that the set of all admissible subsets corresponding to our fixed chain forms a semiperfect crystal . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ [ sec : chains ] ] let us fixed a chain which is the union of two foldings with the same fold number , and let us fix the time interval between them . given an admissible folding , let us define a fixed chain that is the sum of the positions of the admissible foldings in the two fold positions . then we define a root operator that is defined in the beginning of the paper . by proposition [ prope ] ( 1 ) , the collection of all the root operators corresponding to the fixed chain is a semi perfect crystal , that is , there is no overlap between the two folding positions of our fixed chains . in the following ,<n> we are interested in the structure of the crystal formed by the fixed chains obtained from the foldings of the above mentioned class . for a given class of chains , _<n> i.e.  in this paper , we propose a setup for coherent timing of an @xmath0-level system on a ring , analogous to the ls chain setup in ( * ? ?<n> * theorem 8.3 ) ; nevertheless , there are some features specifically related to our setup , such as the reversal of the total order on the set in which the timing pattern takes values , and the use of proposition [ lastlevel ] in lemma [ lemtiming ] ( used below ) which is analogous to that for ls chains . <n> * keywords : * quantum timing , coherent timing pattern , semiperfect crystal , ls - type chains , lem timing . in @xcite<n> , it was shown that a quantum bit ( qubit ) can be coupled to a quantum oscillator ( qso ) by means of a ls ( linear schrdinger ) chain ( ls ) in the ground state .<n> it was also shown that the state of the qso can be chosen in such a way as to minimize the sum of the energies of the qubits with respect to the two possible values of the oscillator . since then , various schemes have we introduce a new concept of coherent timing , which is analogous to the concept of ls chains .<n> it is based on the notion of a root operator , and is defined in a way that is similar to the definition of the ls chain ; hence , it can be regarded as a coherent version of the latter . in this paper , we introduce coherent timing in the context of the littlewood - richardson ( lr ) rule . <n> coherent timing is defined as the set of values at which a system , described by a set of observables @xmath0 , behaves in a coherent way , i.e. , as a sequence of values converges to a common value ; in other words , a system behaves coherently , in the sense that all of its values converge to a single value . the lr rule @xcite states that , for a given observable , the system s dynamics can be characterized in terms of the values of the observables , provided that the dynamics is well approximated by the dynamics of an appropriately defined linear system ( ls ) . on the other hand ,<n> a coherent system is one in which in this paper , we introduce a new model of littlewood - richardson ( ls ) chains , which we call @xmath0-ls chains .<n> we show that the ls chains in our model can be chosen to form a chain with any given monomial distribution . in particular<n> , our model has only one free parameter , the size of the largest eigenvalue of the chain . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] in @xcite , it was shown that the growth rate of the critical exponent of a ls chain can be determined from the behavior of the eigenvalues of its jacobian ; in other words , one can _ predict _ the growth of the exponent of the  critical exponent '' of a chain , in terms of its growth rate as a function of its size . the _ critical exponent _<n> is defined as the ratio between the growth rates of the first and second critical exponents . for a chain of length @x ,<n> the exponent is the same as the one for the chain with the smallest number of elements , and is equal to the value for the smallest chain in the model . as in @xcite , littelmann introduced lakshmibai - seshadri ( ls ) chains , a class of maps from @xmath0 to itself that generalizes the notion of continuous maps . in this paper , we show that ls chains can be embedded into a larger class of smooth maps , which we call _ continuous smooth maps_. in particular , the maps in this class can be used to define a new class of bruhat - invariant invariants .<n> we use these maps to prove that the minimum of the bruhat order on a certain class of ls - type maps is an invariant . <n> introduction the concept of a bruhat invariant was introduced by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) in their study of the uniform distribution of the haar measure on the circle . as a natural extension of their work on uniform distributions ,<n> the authors introduced continuous smooth mappings in order to obtain a new invariant that is invariant under bruhat and other natural orders . since the concept was introduced , it has found numerous interesting applications , including in the study of dynamical systems , statistical mechanics in this note , we give a new proof of the fact that littelmann s @xmath0 algebra , which is the complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebra of piecewise - constant left - continuous maps , is a subalgebra of the _ dynkin - niemeyer _ ( dnl ) algebra @xcite .<n> we also show that the dnl algebra is isomorphic to a certain _ dual _ dnl - algebra . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @cite , where we gave a short proof of a result of sidoravicius and vesztergombi on the isomorphism between the complex dnl and dnl k3 algebras . here<n> we give another proof of this result . we associate to a fixed continuous path from @xmath0 in the dominant weyl chamber of @xcite , a path from the interior of the chamber to the boundary , and a corresponding colored directed graph .<n> we show that these paths form a crystal , that the associated graph does not depend on the initial path and that there is a corresponding littlewood - richardson rule . <n> we also consider the special case of _ finite _ littelmann paths , which were defined in the setup of complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras . in this setup ,<n> one can associate a finite path from a point on the boundary of the dominant chamber to a path starting from the same point inside the chamber , where the corresponding function is weakly decreasing ( respectively weakly increasing ) . we showed in section [ sec : finite ] that such a path has the structure of a perfect crystal . as an application<n> , we obtain a new proof of a result of stembridge , showing that the set of paths obtained from a fixed path via root operators via a particular initial path forms an admissible system . we prove that increasing littelmann paths ( obtained from a fixed path via root operators ) have the structure of a perfect crystal . <n> let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional riemannian manifold , and fix a non - negative integer , the so - called lambda - root .<n> we show that there is an increasing lambda- or littemann - path ( ls ) chain in bruhat order , a saturated ls chain , or a perfect lambda- root path ( plp ) . in the process , we prove the following : [ 1 ] . for any positive integer @ x , there is a finite number of roots @x , such that for all @xcite , @xxmath1 , where the set of simple roots is the minimal set of roots for which the path is nonsingular . here<n> @x<n> stands for  simple root '' , which means that the path obtained from the roots is either  complete '' ( i.e. , does not intersect any other path ) or  rough '' ( in the sense of richardson - stembridge rule ) and is  in this paper , we show that the set @xmath0 consists of a saturated chain in bruhat order , a saturated increasing chain , and an increasing chain in the ls orbit . <n> [ theore]*theorem * [ theoree]proposition [ theo]lemma [ thee]corollary [ thea]remark [ [ mathematics - subject - classification-2010 ] * mathematics subject classification ( 2010 ) * : primary 53c44 ;

[ [ introduction ] ] introduction + the aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of some of the recent developments in the theory of saturated cosets ( sc ) .<n> we will start with a brief introduction of sc , followed by a description of the main results of @xcite . in section [ descriptionfold ]<n> we introduce a new class of operators , which we call _ saturated folding operators _ , for describing affine hyperplanes in a unified way . here<n> , the operators @x in this note , we introduce a new family of folding operators .<n> these operators are defined on the whole real line , not only on the segments from 0 to @xmath0 , as in the standard ( non - folding ) approach . here<n> , the relevant segments are weighted , and the weight of the relevant operator is equal to the sum of the weights of the corresponding segments . <n> we use these new operators to construct a new class of extremal operators , which we call _ path - extremal _ operators : they are extremal in the sense that any path in the new family is extremal if and only if its corresponding level sequence is extremally extended . as an application ,<n> we prove that the extremal orbits of the new operators are equal to those of the standard folding operators in the case when the number of segments is large enough . in this case , for any admissible set of path operators ( in particular , if the weight coincides with the maximal possible weight ) , there is an admissible subset of the real line such that the corresponding extremal orbit has the same probability distribution as the one given by the standard operator . *<n> introduction : * we consider a path @xmath0 $ ] , where the folding operators @x ] are defined , and assume that the value of the function s on the complement of the path is less than or equal to its value on an affine hyperplane . in this paper , we prove that , if the corresponding function has a non - trivial minimum , then the corresponding point does not lie on any of the above hyperplanes . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite .<n> it is written in the following form : [ thm]proposition [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ] corollary [ theorems]remark [ section ] it is well - known that the natural homotopy type of a path in the complex plane , defined by the action of the hamiltonian on the space of real numbers , is the same as that of a real number , provided that the path does not pass through any hyperplane ( in particular , it does not intersect any affino hyperplane in its way ) . moreover , the corresponding hamiltonians can be expressed as the sum of the in this note , we prove a new version of the @xmath0-limit theorem , which is : 1 . <n> we prove that the limit of the sequence of homotopy classes of subsets of the circle is uniformly close to the set of all admissible subsets , and 2 .<n> we show that the corresponding sequence of ls chains converges uniformly to the chain of antidominant weights corresponding to the limit . in the proof ,<n> we introduce a new bijection between the corresponding subsets and the antidominant weight chains ; this bijection is used to prove the above results , as well as a new bound for the size of a subset in the case of an eigenvalue problem for a schrdinger operator on the circle . as a corollary of the main theorem<n> we obtain a bound on the number of paths in the circle that can be reached from the origin by an ls chain with a fixed number of steps ; in particular , this bound is tight for a large class of examples , including all eigenvalues of the selberg zeta - function . the limit theorem @xcite is one of the most important results of the last decades ; it states that we construct a new class of kac - moody algebras , in the spirit of @xcite , that contains as a special case the well - known constructions of littelmann , kashiwara , and lakshmibai .<n> we conjecture that our construction can be viewed as a limiting case of a construction due to joseph . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the purpose of this paper is to give a new proof of the fact that the minima of the paths associated to ls chains are integers ; this proof was given in a separate paper using different methods . given a complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebra , we consider the colored directed graph defined by the action of root operators on the admissible subsets corresponding to the special choice of a @xmath0-chain above . we conjecture that this graph isomorphic to the crystal graph of the irreducible representation with highest weight @xcite , that is , the crystal of the associated quantum group .<n> we prove this conjecture for finite types ( i.e. , complex semisimple lie algebras ) . we show that a finite @xmath0-chain of roots can be written in terms of alcoves .<n> we also give a combinatorial characterization of the alcoves that can be obtained via the affine translation of a fundamental alcove . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a finite chain of roots , each of which is given by an alcove , and we study the combinatorics of the finite chain in the case when the weight of the chain is fixed and the number of roots is fixed . the axioms of a chain in this case can be rewritten as follows : ( 1 ) in the finite case , if and only if , for any triple of roots in the chain , the set of all alcoves orthogonal to the roots is a finite subset of the fundamental alcove of the new alcove ; and ( 2 ) each alcove can be given by a finite collection of integers , associated with a collection of alcove paths that is in bijection with the reduced decompositions of the elements in the elements of the element in the characteristic space of the root set . we say that two alcoves are in this paper , we introduce @xmath0-chains , a generalization of the notion of a reflection ordering .<n> we show that the axioms of a finite @x <n> s lambda chain can be rewritten in terms of the weight of a _ gallery _ , which is a sequence of reduced alcoves . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] a lambda chain is an extension of a weyl group element to a lambda folding operator . in the finite case ,<n> a chain is said to be _ finite _ if it is finitely presented as follows : ( 1 ) for any non - empty set of positive integers , define the lambda operator to be the operator which acts on the set of integers by leaving its initial segment intact and by reflecting the remaining tail in the affine hyperplane ; and ( 2 ) if the weight ( or the length ) of the gallery is equal to the sum of the lengths of the initial segments of the operator , then the chain is finite . for a finite number of positive integer roots @xcite , for example , the axiom ( condition [ lambdachain ] ) in proposition [ equivalence ] is : in this paper , we study a model of generalized flag varieties , which is a generalization of the model in @xcite , whose construction was based on the geometry of the generalized flag variety .<n> we prove that our model gives a complete description of the @xmath0-chain . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]proposition [ theorem][ theorem]remark this paper is devoted to the study of a model that we call _ generalized flag _ varieties ( _ gfl _ for short ) , and which generalizes the well - known _ flag varieties_. let us fix a _ face _ of the gfl and define its _ coxeter number _ to be the _ dominant weight _<n> , i.e. , the largest weight of a coroot that has maximal height . we will see that the commutator between the face and the highest coroot of the lattice can be written in terms of _ alcoves _ and _ folding operators_. the folding operator is the operator which acts on a chain ( or a class of chains ) by leaving its initial segment intact and by reflecting we consider the littelmann path problem on a one - dimensional lattice of codimension @xmath0 , with a finite number of jacobian weights .<n> we prove that , for any non - zero coxeter number , there is an upper bound on the maximum height of the highest coroot that can be reached by a path on the lattice . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a lower bound for the spectral gap in the continuum limit of the model . <n> introduction ------------ the study of path - preserving discrete dynamical systems is an active research area in condensed matter physics . in particular , the problem of finding a complete set of paths on a discrete lattice of hamiltonians is of considerable interest , and has been studied by a number of authors in recent years ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , in this context , it is important to understand the interplay between discreteness and topology of the system , as well as between dynamical properties of the path and of the hamiltonian . among the various approaches that have been proposed to tackle this problem , one of the most successful is the one proposed by maurer in 1974 @x in this paper , we introduce a new model of littelmann paths , which we call @xmath0-littelmann chains .<n> we show that this model can be , in a suitable sense , based on any _ _ set of _<n> any_-@xmath0 _ piecewise - linear paths . <n> the study of dynamical systems on higher - dimensional euclidean spaces has led , over the last two decades , to a fruitful interplay between dynamical systems , quantum field theory , and mathematical physics . among the various dynamical systems that have been investigated @xcite ,<n> one of the most fruitful is the so - called _ dynamical system model _ ( dsm ) . in this model<n> , a system is described by a collection of paths ; these paths are _ continuous _ in the sense that they do not change in time , but they do depend on an external parameter , such as the position and the orientation of the observer in the space . as a consequence , the behavior of the system under perturbation is determined by the path , rather than by the external parameter of the model , as was the case in this note , we give a new proof of the well - known result that admissible subsets of @xmath0 lambda - chains are equal in weight .<n> we also give an alternative proof of this result , which is based on a reformulation of the lambda - chain model in terms of left - hand derivatives . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]proposition [ stm]corollary [ theorem]conjecture [ theorem ] # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 1#2#3#4#5#6   # 1&#2&#3 + # 4&#5&#6 + # 7&#8&#9  + # 10= 0=0 1= 1=1 0>1 # 1 / we present a graphical representation of the @xmath0-character in terms of a chain of foldings .<n> this is achieved by applying the corresponding affine reflections to the foldings and by bouncing steps in the paths . <n> [ section ] [ thm]proposition [ tm]corollary this paper is a continuation of a series of papers @xcite , where we introduced a graphical approach to the character of a folding . in the first part of this series<n> , we introduced the concept of admissible subsets and showed how they can be used to represent the character in a graphical way . here<n> we extend the graphical approach further and show how the character can be obtained from the bouncing steps of a path in the chain . let @xmath0 be the set of indices of bouncing steps in the path of an affine coxeter arrangement .<n> we prove that @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ] proposition [ proposition ] definition [ proposition]conjecture [ proposition][ proposition]example @=11 addtoresetequationsection normalsizesetsizexiipt plus3pt minus3pt@ plus3.5pt minus0pttwosidetrue <n> @=12 # 1 # 1 = by60 = # 1bsphack@filesw gtempaauxout gtempbtempa @nobreak esphack eqnlabel vacuum # 1 <n> = cmss12 = cmu10 scaled1 # 1([#1 ] ) = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmr10 scaled3 = cmti10 scaled4 = cmmi10 scaled5 = cmtt10 scaled6 = cmmib10 scaled7 = mtmib7 scaled8 = = = @#1#1@#1 @@#1#1#1 # 1@xmath9 ) # 1#2#1 # 2 # 1#1 | # 1| # 1 | #",

space spanned by a small number of stopping times . for a given particle<n> , this quantity is called the _ stopping time_. in quantum mechanics , stopping times ( rts ) are defined as the time required by the quantum system to return to its initial state after stopping for a certain amount of time . the standard method to estimate the stopping time in this paper , we introduce a new model of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .<n> the model consists of two parts : the first part is a stopping model and the second part is an @xmath0-stopping model . in both models ,<n> we define the stopping time as the ratio between the stopping times of the first and second parts . <n> the main purpose of this paper is to study the value of the lyapunov exponent of the stopping model in the limit of small stopping times . to this end , first we introduce the concept of stopping time , which is a useful mathematical tool in the study of stopping processes , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . as a particular case of this approach , in this work<n> we consider the following model of spdes which is called _ lemme stopping model_. in this model , the starting point of the process is a fixed point and the process stops when its stopping time at this point reaches a certain value , this value is called the lemme value . for this model<n> , it is known that for all time the stopping value is strictly smaller than 1 . however , there are in this paper , we introduce a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm for the simulation of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .<n> our mcmc algorithm is based on the gaussian white noise ( wgn ) model with uniform distribution , which is an i.i.d . random variable ( r.v . )<n> model . in particular , our algorithm is not restricted to the case where the mean square error ( mse ) of the model is smaller than @xmath0 , and we can simulate also the case when the mse is greater than or equal to 1 . we prove that the value of the value function can be computed analytically in the regime where the error of the mse is small compared to the mean squared error ( rmse ) and the noise is small . moreover ,<n> we show that , in this regime , the solution of the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) can be well approximated by that of a brownian particle moving in a harmonic potential with the same speed as in the case of uniform distribution random variables ( wdrs ) ( * ? ?<n> in this paper , we study the lipschitz properties of the operator @xmath0 , which is defined as follows : @xcite .<n> + + + in this work , first we will show that there exists a lipschiatz operator , denoted by _ mathbbr(pi , y)big|)$ ] , such that the operator s equation is given by the formula :  sum_i=1qpiiint_0t*_intmath bbr  big| ] $ ] and the coefficients of the function @x<n> . then we will prove that there is a lipschitz operator _<n> lambda circ@xmath1  c_tilde u|,]] ] such that there exist a constants @xxmath2 , @x , so that one can find the function s coefficients . +<n> + in the second part of this paper we will give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the constants , namely , that the we present the results of a study of the electronic structure of @xmath0k spin-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnets with ferromagnetic coupling in the non -

nucleon collisions is one of the main topics in the field of relativistic heavy ion collisions . in this context<n> , it is of interest to investigate the properties of the cross sections for the reaction of interest , in particular , to determine the cross section for the production of the first excited state of the nucleon @xcite . for this purpose ,<n> a large amount of work has been done in the literature , both theoretical and experimental , using different approaches , such as perturbative , semi - classical and fully quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models , as well as monte carlo ( mc ) methods . however , there is no general consensus on the theoretical we present the results of a study of the angular distribution of charged particles emitted from relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic energies .<n> the analysis is performed in the framework of the non - relativistic impulse approximation ( nria ) . <n> relativistic heavy - ion ( rhic ) collisions at intermediate to high energies ( @xmath0 mev / nucleon ) offer a unique opportunity to study the interaction of heavy ions with nucleons and nuclei in a wide range of wavevectors and momenta . in this work<n> , we focus on the angular distributions of produced charged particles ( ions and targets ) emitted from such collisions at the relativistic energies of the rhic beams . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> the investigation is motivated by the development of the nria formalism @xcite , which is expected to provide a useful tool for the study of interactions between heavy ions and nucleons in a broad energy range . for a review of the current experimental and theoretical status of the problem , see refs.@xcite we present the first measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic .<n> the data were taken at an incident energy of 200 gev , with the muon solenoidal beam of the mainz microtron mami . <n> the measurement was performed using a transverse momentum spectrometer , which allowed us to perform the first transverse momentum measurement of a meson produced in a central collision . the data ,<n> when combined with earlier data from the d0 collaboration , provide new insights into the production mechanism and the properties of the meson . in recent years<n> , a number of high energy collisions have been carried out at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern @xcite , leading to a revival of interest in the physics of heavy - ion collision and in particular in the search for the so - called missing link , i.e. the production of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the collision of two hadrons . despite a great deal of theoretical and experimental work , the existence of such a qgp has not been conclusively established , although it has been suggested @x we present a study of the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of @xmath0 production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> we show that the rapidity distribution of the nucleon is strongly modified by the interaction with the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the early stage of the reaction . in the high energy region , where the qgp is expected to be formed ,<n> the cross section is significantly reduced compared to the case of hadrons with small transverse momenta , due to the suppression of gluon bremsstrahlung . <n> high energy collisions of heavy nuclei at the lhc provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions , as well as to search for new phases of matter @xcite . at high energy , the collision of two or more nuclei leads to the production of a hard object , such as a photon or a quark , whose momentum is transferred to the target by the impact of the nucleus on its surface , leading to the emission of a beam of particles , called a hadron , with large transverse momentum . the total cross section of hadronic collisions we present a study of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .<n> the aim is to investigate the role of the interaction in the formation of such exotic states . <n> the recent discovery of baryonic resonances at the rhic ( lhc ) collider has revived interest in the study of exotic states of matter produced in these collisions . in particular ,<n> the existence of resonances with exotic properties has been conjectured @xcite , which could be related to the so - called baryon - antibaryon ( bec ) blockade of heavy nuclei in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the collision of heavy ions at relativistic energies ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) . here<n> , we present the first results of a systematic study of these resonances in the framework of the parton cascade model of hadronic interactions . for this purpose , <n> we use the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach to describe the qgp collision dynamics , taking into account both the collision dynamics of the colliding nuclei we present the first measurement of transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> the data were taken with the muon solenoidal tracker during the commissioning phase of the experiment . <n> the measurement was performed in the framework of the parton cascade model , where we assume that partons propagate through a medium of quarks and gluons , and that the interaction between partons and the medium is described by the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model . in this model<n> , we find that the transverse momentum of the emitted partons is proportional to the square root of the quark chemical potential , which is in agreement with the perturbative qcd prediction , but differs from the monte - carlo ( mc ) prediction by a factor of about 2 . the experimental data ,<n> when combined with the results of mc , allow us to make predictions for the transverse mass spectra of other light quark flavors produced at rhic and beyond , as well as the average transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of these light quarks at the kinematics of the initial collision of two heavy ions . over the last years we present a calculation of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in high - energy heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .<n> the calculation is performed in the framework of the parton cascade model . <n> the study of the properties of heavy - ion collision systems is one of the most important tasks in relativistic heavy <n> ion physics . in this context<n> , it is of great interest to investigate how the collision dynamics is modified due to the strong interaction between the projectile and target nuclei , and how this is reflected in the final state of the collision . as a result of this interaction ,<n> a number of observables are modified , such as the multiplicity distribution of the particles , their transverse momentum and rapidity distribution , as well as the longitudinal momentum distribution . for a complete understanding of these effects<n> it is necessary to calculate the collisional parton distribution function , which is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the collision product of the outgoing particle with the target nucleus , i.e. , the glauber s equation @xcite . here<n> we present the results of a calculation for the transverse - momentum spectra @x we study the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .<n> in particular , we focus on the transverse - momentum dependence of the two - photon and two - pion cross sections , which are sensitive to the pion - nucleon short - range correlation . <n> the recent discovery of the charmonium and bottomonium @xcite states at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has opened a new chapter in the development of two - particle and three - particle interferometry . in the case of charmonium ,<n> the measurement of the three - body decay of the particle , denoted as m@xmath1 , is of particular interest because of its possible connection with the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition , predicted to occur at the lhc at about 3 tev . for the first time , the experimental data on the inclusive spectrum of the decay , measured at the cern sps , as well as the total cross section of the system , obtained from the different experiments , have been presented in a consistent and comprehensive manner , thus allowing we present the results of a study of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps .<n> the data were taken at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , using the muon solenoid ( pcs ) and the transversely polarized calorimeter ( tppc ) . <n> collisions of heavy ions provide a unique laboratory to study the properties of strongly interacting matter . in particular , high - multiplicity collisions of protons and nuclei<n> give rise to a wealth of new phenomena , such as the suppression of the nuclear gluon distribution , the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the collision zone , as well as the modification of the equation of state ( eos ) of the system . at rhic<n> , collisions of lead nuclei are among the most violent events in the world , due to the strong interaction between nuclei and the surrounding medium @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the understanding of the reaction dynamics is an essential part of the rhic program , which aims at the discovery of new forms of matter and at the we present a study of the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 ratio in heavy ion collisions at lhc energies .<n> we find that the rapidity distribution of the cross section is rather sensitive to the initial energy of the source . as a result ,<n> the lhc data can be used to improve the theoretical cross section . <n> the recent discovery of the charmonium state @xcite has revived interest in the study of its properties , as well as that of its production and decay in the early stages of the heavy - ion collision ( hic ) process . in particular<n> , it has been suggested that charmonium may have a non - vanishing transverse momentum , which would lead to a new source of interference phenomena in the hic process , especially in the low transverse momentum region , where hic is expected to take place . to investigate this possibility , we performed a first - principles calculation of the production of charmonium in the collision of two energetic heavy ions at a center - of - mass energy of 200 gev / nucleon , within the framework of the parton cascade model ( pcm ) . using the results of this calculation we found that the we present the results of a calculation of the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of transverse momentum spectra of charged particles in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .<n> we show that , in general , transverse momentum dependence of rapidity distribution can not be neglected in these collisions . <n> recently , monte - carlo simulations have shown that charged particle transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra are very sensitive to the transverse expansion of the system . in this letter , we present results for the transverse - momentum dependence @xcite of the longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions of charged particle in collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic , lhc ) at beam energies of @x a few gev / nucleon . for a given particle energy ,<n> we investigate the transverse dynamics of the particle s trajectory as a function of its transverse momentum . we find that transverse momentum dependent transverse momentum distribution of particles is sensitive to transverse expansion , while the longitudinal momentum distribution is stable . as a result , these results can be used to predict the transverse energy dependence of particle spectra in collisions of heavy ions at relativistic beam energies , with the aim to optimize the design of we present the first measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in association with two photons in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at 200 gev / nucleon .<n> the data were taken with the phenix detector at the cern sps . <n> the measurement was performed in the framework of the parton cascade model , where the partons are assumed to be produced in the initial stages of the collision by one of the hadrons , the photon , or the initial quark and antiquark state , and the final stage of the interaction by the second hadron . in this way<n> , we are able to investigate the role of the initial state interaction on the production of partons and the subsequent evolution of the system , which is important for the interpretation of the experimental data . as part of our work ,<n> we have also measured the longitudinal momentum distributions of the particles produced at the initial stage . we present the first measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in association with two photons at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> the measurement was performed using the muon energy resolution obtained with the forward muon spectrometer ( fmos ) at the cern sps . <n> the measurements were performed in the framework of the parton cascade model , in which two photons are emitted from the proton and one from the neutron , and their longitudinal momentum distribution is measured simultaneously . in this way , we are able to obtain the first transverse momentum spectrum of a meson at the rhic collider , as well as to determine the average transverse momentum of the emitted photons , which in turn is used to estimate the production cross section of these particles at the lhc . the measurement is in agreement with previous results , showing that the process of photon - meson production is a sensitive probe of parton dynamics at rhic and can be used to constrain the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the early stages of the collision . + pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 13.85. we present the first results on transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 mesons produced in association with one nucleon in heavy ion collisions at lhc energies .<n> the data were taken with the phenix detector at the cern sps . <n> the aim of this work is to investigate the transverse momentum distribution of @ x -

      "generated": "time synchronization is an old problem , but the question of scalability is not . recent advances in sensor networks show a clear trend towards the development of large scale networks with high node density . as well , for many years the smart dust project sought to build cubic - millimeter motes for a wide range of applications .<n> this development ( and many others ) indicate that large scale , high density networks are on the horizon . a need for the synchronization of large distributed systems is very real and one that requires careful study to understand the fundamental performance limits on synchronization . in that work ,<n> models are developed to describe natural synchronization as an emergent behavior in complex networks of oscillators . <n> the second approach is to consider synchronization as a problem of critical slowing down of complex oscillators and then develop models to describe the behavior of synchronization in large networks . here<n> , we develop a new approach to the problem of time synchronization in distributed systems , which is based on the study of the performance limits of synchronization on a large , dense network . the study of the synchronization of large networks has generally taken one of two approaches . the first approach is to consider synchronization as an emergent behavior in complex networks of oscillators . in that work , models are developed to describe natural phenomena and synchronization emerges from these models .<n> the second approach , to develop and analyze algorithms that synchronize engineering networks , has significant limitations . as a result ,<n> a need for the synchronizability of large distributed systems is very real and one that requires careful study to understand the fundamental performance limits on synchronization . here , we consider the problem of _ in situ _ synchronization in large networks . we show that the performance of in situ synchronization is determined by two fundamental limits : the first limit is the network size @xmath0 , and the second is the number of nodes . in this paper , we study the synchronization of a network of nonlinear oscillators . in this model ,<n> the behavior of every single oscillator is governed by a state variable and a phase variable .<n> we prove that for almost all initial conditions , the network converges to a fully synchronous state . in this paper , we consider the synchronization of a class of oscillator networks with arbitrary oscillator frequencies ( clock skew ) . we show that for networks with @xmath0 nodes , the rate of convergence to a fully synchronized state scales with the number of oscillators as @xcite .<n> we also show that the rate at which the network synchronizes converges to a constant , independent of the total number of nodes in the network . <n> network synchronization , oscillator networks . the flooding time synchronization protocol ( ftsp ) @xcite achieves one - hop synchronization by having a root node broadcast timing information to surrounding nodes . these surrounding nodes then proceed to broadcast their synchronization information to nodes beyond the broadcast domain of the root node . this process can continue for multi - hop networks . as a result , a node multiple hops away from the node with the reference clock will be estimating its parameters from intermediate nodes that already have estimation errors . therefore , this introduces a fundamental _ scalability problem _ : as the number of hops across the network grows , the synchronization error across the networks will also grow . in this paper , we present a solution to this scalability problem based on the _ relaxed accuracy constraint synchronization _ ( s) protocol . <n> s is to reduce communication and computation requirements by taking advantage of relaxed accuracy constraints . we study the use of spatial averaging in developing cooperative time synchronization in large wireless networks . to obtain a model for developing cooperative synchronization in a network with @xmath0 nodes uniformly deployed over a fixed finite area , we begin by looking at the signals observed by a node in the network . in this expression ,<n> all nodes transmit a pulse , which is the superposition of all the pulses transmitted by each node ( assumed to be the same for all nodes ) .<n> we assume propagation delay to negligible ( the general case is considered in section [ sec : time delay ] ) and assume that each node can make an accurate timing observation of its neighbors . for the case<n> in which all nodes are to be synchronized , then the basic pulse transmitted by any given node is the same from all the other nodes . <n> we then assume that the nodes have time averaging information , that is , they are able to determine the time at the reference clock and the corresponding time at their local clock , and hence their synchronization . assuming that the time averaged signal observed by any node is in good agreement with the average observed signal of the neighbors , the nodes can use this information to improve their timing observations . we study the scalability of large scale clock synchronization networks .<n> we show that in a network with imperfect clock synchronization among the nodes , as the network density increases and node size decreases , it is possible for all nodes in the network to synchronize their clocks with a bounded error , which is the law of large numbers . <n> the study of scalability of networks is important for a variety of network applications , such as communications , sensor networks , and distributed computing @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a network that is composed of a set of clocks @xmath0 , each of which is deployed in a distributed manner in a large scale network , with the goal of synchronizing the clocks of all the nodes in this network with a common time reference . for a given network size and node density ,<n> we are able to show that for any fixed network size , for any set of network parameters , there is a law of high numbers for the number of clocks that can be synchronized in a fraction of the network s nodes : for example , if all nodes have a clock with a delay smaller than a given threshold , then as the number s of nodes increases , the network we show how to use _ cooperative time synchronization _ among a large number of nodes to average out the inherent timing errors in each node .<n> this technique allows each node to estimate _ deterministic _ parameters ( such as the location of certain zero - crossings ) from an aggregate output signal in the limit as node density grows unbounded . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]lemma [ theorem ] proposition [ theorem)corollary the problem of estimating the arrival time @xmath0 at a given node ( in the reference time ) in an _<n> arbitrary _ time - varying network is of fundamental interest . in this paper<n> , we address the following question : can we use a technique called _ cooperation _ to _ synchronize _ the clocks at the nodes ?<n> that is , can all the nodes in a network synchronize their clocks so that their timing errors can be averaged out ? <n> the answer is yes , and the key to proving all our results is the law of large numbers . we consider the problem of time synchronization in dense wireless networks .<n> we propose a new technique that allows for spatial averaging and has favorable scaling properties . using this technique ,<n> we show that cooperative time synchronization works perfectly for negligible propagation delay . when propagation delay is considered , we find that asymmetries at the boundaries reveal some limitations that need to be carefully considered in designing algorithms that take advantage of spatial averaging . in analyzing the proposed cooperative time synchronizing technique<n> , our goal is to show that the proposed technique can average out all random error and provide deterministic parameters for synchronization as node density grows unbounded . this asymptotic result can be viewed as a _ convergence in scale _ to synchrony . the result serves as a theoretical foundation for allowing a new trade - off between node density and synchronization performance . we consider the problem of cooperative time synchronization for pulse - coupled oscillators in a multi - node network .<n> each node in the network has its own local clock and can utilize the arrival times of many pulses over an extended period of time . by maintaining a table of pulse - arrival times , a node can synchronize all other nodes if and only if it is time - synchronized with the clock of a particular node . in this paper , we average out all random error and provide deterministic parameters for synchronization as node density grows unbounded . this asymptotic result can be viewed as a _ convergence in scale _ to synchrony . the result serves as a theoretical foundation for allowing a new trade - off between node density and synchronization performance . <n> in particular , higher node density can yield better synchronization . we are given a set of nodes in a network and we wish to synchronize them in such a way that all other nodes synchronize as well .<n> we do not assume that any particular node is special in any way ; its clock is simply a reference time on which to synchronize the other nodes . in this paper<n> , we develop a model for random timing jitter that , for dense networks , gives the appropriate aggregate signal magnitude at any given node . using this model ,<n> we are able to analyze the aggregate waveform observed at a particular node in asymptotically dense networks and derive a lower bound on the network size that is tight for all distances . <n> time - varying networks are ubiquitous in today s society . from time - evolving networks such as cellular networks @xcite , to distributed computing networks like peer - to - peer ( p2p ) @xmath0 or random graph and communication ( rgc ) networks @xi , it is important to understand the structure of such networks in order to understand how they form , how they evolve , and how they behave in real - world situations . for example , in the study of time - dependent networks it is useful to know how the structure we consider the problem of transmitting a waveform over a network of nodes with a small number of transmitter nodes .<n> we are interested in the magnitude of the aggregate waveform observed at a receiver node . to solve this problem<n> , we develop a random model for pathloss that , for asymptotically dense networks , gives the appropriate aggregate signal magnitude at the receiver . using this model ,<n> we derive a closed - form solution to the _ average _ received power at a given distance from the transmitter . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the study of waveforms observed at the nodes of a network is an important and fundamental problem in signal processing @xcite . in this context , it is important to understand how the observed waveforms are related to each other in order to understand the structure of the network . for example , if we are given @xmath0 transmitter nodes and each of them transmits a waveform , then we are looking at the waveform seen by the receiver node at some given distance . we would like to understand , given a set of nodes , how the transmitted waveform is related to the observed aggregate waveform at that node , and what is the best way to model this aggregate waveform we consider the problem of distributing waveforms over a wireless network in the limit of the number of nodes @xmath0 and the total area of the network .<n> we focus on the case where the number , _<n> i.e. _ , the size , of the nodes increases linearly with the distance from the receiver , and we consider two different scenarios . in the first scenario , we assume that the nodes can be connected to each other only through a small number of edge channels . for this case ,<n> we derive the asymptotic distribution of the aggregate waveform and show that it is well approximated by a log - normal distribution , where the exponent is a function of the scaling factor . <n> wireless networks , as their name suggests , can be used to transmit and receive information over time - varying links @xcite . here , a network is defined as a set of nodes (  nodes '' ) that are connected to the rest of the world by a short - range communication channel , such as a wireless local area network ( wlan ) , or a cellular network ; a node is called a  receiver '' if it is located in the same area we introduce the concept of pathloss , which is the loss of information due to incomplete processing of information carried by a path through a complex network .<n> we model pathloss by introducing a joint delay random variable and a corresponding pathloss random variable that captures the joint distribution of the pathloss and delay random variables . in the limit of vanishing pathloss<n> , we show that the information loss rate scales as @xmath0 , and the maximum information transmission rate is given by @xcite . <n> pathloss is an important aspect of complex networks , appearing in a variety of contexts , such as resource allocation , resource allocation control , urban planning , transportation , social services , etc . for example , in the design of resource allocation systems , it is important to understand the tradeoffs between transmission and processing speed , as well as between the amount of information that needs to be processed and the amount that can be conveyed . here<n> we introduce pathloss in the context of network information processing , a topic that has gained considerable attention in the last few years ( see , e.g. , refs . [ ] for a review of this area of research )  we develop a general model for time - delayed propagation in complex networks .<n> this model can be used to model both pathloss and time delay in a variety of contexts , such as wireless local area networks ( wlans ) , multi - hop networks , and multi - carrier networks ( mcn networks )<n> . we will show that , under general conditions , there is a one - to - one relationship between the average pathloss of the network and the propagation delay . <n> * introduction . *<n> propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for a signal to propagate a distance in a wireless network @xcite . in a wlan @xmath0 ,<n> a pulse sent by a node in the network will be seen at the receiver if the distance between the two nodes is less than the distance that the pulse takes to propagate the distance from the receiver to the node . for a single - hop network<n> , this distance is the distance of the node that received the pulse . if the network is a multi -hop network , then there will be a set of nodes whose transmissions will never reach the receiving node , i.e. infinite delay , since each receiving node we present a model for pathloss and propagation delay in complex networks .<n> we show that the distribution of pathloss in a network depends on both the delay and the pathloss random variable . for a single - hop network ,<n> we derive a closed - form expression for the deterministic pathloss function . using this function , we define a probability density function for the probability of finding a node with a given probability of having received a signal from all the other nodes in the network . as an example of application of our model , in this paper we study the performance of multi - hop cellular networks with random pathloss . <n> the analysis of complex networks is an active area of research in the field of information theory @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in studying complex networks for two main reasons . on the one hand , due to the complexity of the network structure , it is becoming more and more common to use approximations to describe the network in terms of a small number of nodes , i.e. links , instead of a complete set of nodes and links . from a theoretical point of view , this study is motivated by the fact that , despite the we introduce a model of complex networks in which delay is introduced as a deterministic function of the distance between the sender and the receiver of the transmitted signal .<n> we show that the distribution of the delay value is related to the total area of the network . using this relation ,<n> we develop a simple model for the emergence of delay in complex networks . <n> _ introduction. _ complex networks are ubiquitous in nature , engineering , society , and the financial industry . in many cases<n> , the evolution of a complex network can be described by a sequence of deterministic and random variables , such as the topology , degree of connectivity , number of nodes , delay , pathloss , etc . @xcite in this letter , we consider a special case of such networks : complex networks with delay . here , a network is defined as a set of connected components , each of which is characterized by a distance @xmath0 from the transmitter . for a signal transmitted from a node at a given distance , there is a probability that the signal arrives at the node with delay larger than some threshold value . as a result , _<n> i ) _ the we present a method to connect the pathloss and propagation delays experienced by a signal propagating through a complex network .<n> the method is based on the observation that the fraction of the network area outside a circle of radius @xmath0 centered at a given node is related to its delay value . using this correlation ,<n> we are able to accurately model the waveform that arrives at the node with both path loss and propagation delay . as a result , we can accurately approximate the received delay , pathloss , and average transmission efficiency . <n> complex networks , which consist of several interconnected components , can be used to convey a wide range of information , including images , videos , catalogs , maps , etc . for example , the internet is an example of such a network @xcite . in general<n> , a signal will suffer from two main types of propagation delays : pathloss ( which is the time it takes for a signal to travel through the network and receive its destination ) and the propagation delay ( which determines the time a signal needs to be transmitted before it can send or receive its information ) . while the first type of delay can be modeled as a random waveform , we present a network model that allows any number of nodes in a multiterminal communication network to synchronize their waveforms .<n> the synchronization phase is the interval of time during which a synchronization pulse is transmitted by a node . in this model<n> we can approximate the aggregate waveform at any node as a function of the pulse - arrival - time probability , pathloss , and propagation delay . <n> synchronization is the ability of a network of nodes to synchronize the waveforms that they transmit , so that any two nodes in the network can send the same information at the same time . when a network is synchronized , each node can use the information from all the other nodes that it is connected to to achieve a common goal . for example , if a network connects all of its nodes with a high - speed fiber network , then each node will be able to send its own information packets at the speed of light @xmath0 , which is much faster than the information packets that a single node would need to send . to realize this goal ,<n> many different types of communication networks have been proposed @xcite . among them , there are single - link networks , such as wavelength - division multiplexing networks @x in this paper , we study the problem of interconnecting a set of nodes that are all connected by pulse - coupled oscillators .<n> we assume that each node is connected to @xmath0 oscillators that are connected by pathloss , and that each oscillator is coupled to its nearest neighbors by a pulse - connection function that depends on the pulse arrival time and pulse magnitude . in our model , each node transmits a pulse with an arbitrarily short duration and each node s detection of the arrival of a pulse is based only on the magnitude and arrival time of the pulse . we show that any two nodes can be connected by a single pulse if and only if their pulse arrival times are known to the other nodes . as a result ,<n> we show how to implement a network of nodes with this property . <n> the last few years have seen an explosion of interest in the use of quantum networks @xcite . among the many applications that have been proposed , one of the most promising<n> is that of quantum repeaters , where the nodes can communicate over a long distance using only quantum bits , i.e. , quantum bits that can be sent over long distances with high fidelity . to realize such a system in a recent paper , mirollo and strogatz proposed a scheme for quantum repeaters based on pulse - coupled oscillators . in this paper<n> , we extend their model by introducing non - local correlations between the nodes .<n> we show that local correlations are a necessary and sufficient condition for the repeater to function as a quantum repeater . <n> _ introduction : _ in their recent paper @xcite mirollo & strogatze proposed a model for a network of @xmath0 nodes that can be used for quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , quantum teleportation , and quantum error correction ( qec)@xcite . to demonstrate the viability of their model , they showed that the nodes can be connected to each other by a small number of pulses and that they can operate as a single - station quantum repeater ( qsr ) even when the nodes do not have direct access to a quantum channel . as a result ,<n> the network of nodes in the model could be used as a qip device , even though it was shown to be impossible to connect all the nodes to a single qubit at once . pulse - coupled oscillators have been proposed as a platform for quantum information processing and communication . in this work ,<n> we show that a pulse - based , single - node quantum computing architecture can be realized by coupling oscillators that are able to transmit and receive pulses .<n> the nodes will be nodes in a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) triangle , and the time at which the oscillators will next fire is determined by the number of pulses that will be transmitted from one node to the other in the triangle . <n> quantum computation is a promising field of research that aims to solve problems beyond the capability of classical computers @xcite . to realize a scalable architecture for quantum computation<n> , it is essential that the computational resources are available to perform a large number of complex calculations , such as factoring , entanglement generation , teleportation , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , as well as many other types of computational tasks . among the various architectures proposed for quantum computing , the one that has received the most attention<n> is the one based on the interaction between nodes and their environment , which has been the subject of intense research and development in the past few years . as we present a general model for time - of - arrival ( toa ) clocks based on the concept of pulse - coupled oscillators introduced in @xcite .<n> our model can be used to describe a wide range of physical systems , including quantum clocks , photonic oscillators , and superconducting qubits . in particular , our model provides a general framework for investigating the effects of coupling between a clock node and its surrounding oscillator , which is a key ingredient in the strogatz toa clock proposed by huang and kitaev . <n> quantum clocks are an important component of quantum information processing ( qip ) . as such<n> , they are an essential component of any qip architecture . to date , most of the work on quantum clocks has focused on the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) effect , in which a quantum system , such as a qubit , is periodically driven by a time - dependent signal in order to achieve a desired time - to - value ( tov ) relation . for a clock to function , however , it is important to be able to accurately determine the tov of the clock , as this tov depends we propose a novel synchronization technique for pulse - coupled oscillators with arbitrary coupling functions and arbitrary propagation delay .<n> we show that our synchronization technique has useful limiting properties . <n> _ ocis codes : _ 190.3380 , 190.4420 , 260.2030 , 260.5380 _<n> key words and phrases :_ pulse coupling , synchronization , pulse delay , time -

synchronous and time - desynchronized clocks ; and ( ii ) synchronization of clocks that are not time - synchronized . for the time - synchronization problem ,<n> we develop a new technique , called timesynchronization , that is based on pulse connection functions . the pulse connection function @xmath0 is defined in terms of the pulse durations , or pulse widths , of the input pulses , which are time - sampled from the output pulses . here , a pulse connection we study the problem of steady - state pulse synchronization in a multi - node network with gaussian jitter . in our model , pulse transmission occurs at the ideal transmit time plus some random error .<n> we find properties for the pulse waveforms that will give us desirable properties in the rms ( root mean square ) jitter , which is measured in terms of the clock of a node . <n> then , we show that our proposed synchronization technique and its associated pulse - connection function can give us the desired properties . in this paper , we study synchronization in networks with multi - hop nodes . we show that if nodes can synchronize their time of arrival to a common pulse , then they can achieve synchronization in a steady - state manner .<n> we also show that in a multi - node network , the pulse - connection function can be used to achieve synchronization . <n> synchronization is one of the most important concepts in the theory of complex networks @xcite . in a network of @xmath0 nodes ,<n> there is a link between the nodes that are connected to each other by a link that is at least as long as the network is connected to the nodes in which the nodes are connected . for a single - hop network<n> , it is well known that if there is no link between any pair of nodes in the network then they are unlikely to synchronize . on the other hand , for a network with more than one hop , there has been theoretical and numerical work showing that if the network can be made to evolve in time then it may be possible to synchronize the time arrival times of different pulses . here<n> we consider the problem of finding a synchronization technique that will give us the desired properties in the pulse arrival time . in this paper , we present a new way to transmit and receive waveforms over time - varying channels .<n> we assume that nodes can transmit pulses and receive signals at the same time . for each node<n> , it transmits a pulse at a time @xmath0 , and receives a synchronized waveform at a different time scale . in this work ,<n> we focus on characterizing the aggregate waveform for any one synchronization phase , i.e. on characterizing signals that have a positive amplitude and then transition to a negative amplitude . <n> we show that there is a one - to - one relationship between the maximum received signal magnitude and the maximum number of zero - crossings that can be made in a single pulse . using this relationship , characterization of the aggregate signal waveform , as well as the arrival time and pulse arrival time for a node , can be computed . as an example application of this approach , for a network of nodes that are able to exchange synchronization pulses , the average node can be characterized in terms of its average pulse receive ( arrival ) time and average signal magnitude , which can be compared to the sum of the maximum and minimum values of the waveform for a single synchronization phase<n> . we consider a network of nodes that seek to synchronize the time signals sent by different nodes in the network .<n> we assume that each node can send a single pulse at a time , and that pulses can be exchanged between nodes in a cooperative manner . in this paper , we present a distributed synchronization scheme that achieves asymptotic cooperative time synchronization . <n> time synchronization ( ts ) is a fundamental concept in many areas of science and engineering , such as synchronization of time signals , synchronization of clocks , time synchronization of chemical reactions , etc . for many applications ,<n> it is essential that time signals be synchronized so that they can be used to perform calculations , manipulate data , or send and receive data at the same time @xcite . to achieve this goal , in the field of information science , it is important to understand how to create synchronization pulses in a distributed system , how to use these pulse trains as a tool for the creation of time - synchronized states , as well as how to synchronize multiple synchronization pulses at different times . here<n> we present an approach to time synchronization that is asymptotically cooperative , i.e. , each node in a network synchronizes its time signals in this paper we describe a mechanism for the synchronization of two time - varying pulses in a network of nodes .<n> the mechanism is asymptotically cooperative , i.e. cooperative time synchronization is achieved without the need for any kind of prior knowledge about the network or the pulse waveforms . <n> synchronization is one of the most fundamental problems in non - linear time - dependent systems @xcite . in such systems ,<n> a pulse can be used to convey a state of the system at some time @xmath0 . at that time<n> , the system may be in a stationary state or in a non - stationary state depending on which pulse is received at which point in time the system collectively synchronizes itself to achieve a common goal . for systems that are not stationary , it is possible for the system to synchronize itself at any time in the past . on the other hand , for systems<n> that are stationary and want to synchronize at some future time , there is a possibility that the system will not be able to do so . as a result , at some point in the future , a system will be unable to achieve any of the goals it has set out to accomplish , and it may even fail we consider a system of @xmath0 independent random variables that are uniformly distributed according to the gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) .<n> we assume that the random variables are drawn uniformly at random from a binary distribution and that they are independent with the same probability distribution at each time instant . in this paper<n> , we study the time evolution of the mean and variance of the two quantities , as well as the mean of the distribution , for the system s final state . <n> * keywords : * time evolution , mean -

interacting oscillators , each of which has its own behavior .<n> the simplest synchronization scheme that allows for synchronization is one where the oscillators are allowed to be deterministic , and the system is allowed to evolve in a deterministic fashion . for this scheme to work , it is essential that the deterministic parameters for the system are known . here<n> , we will show that it is possible to recover these deterministic parameters from a random sequence of non - deterministic random variables with the following property : if the random variables have a non - zero variance , then they can be used to provide time synchronization . as an example , if we have a system that is in a synchronous state and we want to recover the time - dependent deterministic parameters of this synchronization scheme then we can use random variables that have a zero mean , but possibly different variance . time synchronization in dense networks is an important problem that has received little attention in the literature . here , we introduce a new technique that allows time synchronization to be performed indefinitely in asymptotically dense networks .<n> we show that deterministic parameters that allow for time synchronization can be recovered from the properties of the network s steady - state . <n> time synchronization @xcite is the process by which time is synchronized between a set of time - synchronized pulse events observed at different nodes in a network . in networks ,<n> the goal is for each node to send a pulse to all its neighbors in the network in such a way that each neighbor sees the result and reacts accordingly . to perform this synchronization<n> , the nodes need to synchronize their pulse arrival times , @xmath0 , to a common clock that is defined by the arrival times of the pulses seen by the other nodes . for time - synchronization to work , each node needs to know its own pulse arrival time in the past , which is known as _ time synchronization_. in this work we address the question of whether we can recover deterministic time synchronization parameters by averaging over the arrival time distributions of the pulse pulses observed by the nodes in the steady state of a network we introduce a new model for time - synchronization in a multi - node network .<n> we assume that each node in the network has observed a sequence of pulse arrival times , @xmath0 , that occur at integer values of the time scale , _<n> i.e. _ , they are zero - crossing locations . using these arrival time sequences ,<n> each node has two distinct , yet closely related , tasks . the first task is time synchronization , and the second task is transmission of a pulse . we show that if each node can synchronize its time to achieve this task , then it can effectively estimate the time for the next time to occur , which gives it the ability to synchronize to another node . <n> time synchronization is the ability of a large number of nodes in a network to synchronize their time - synchronized output @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider the problem of time synchronization in an idealized model of a multi node network where each node is able to synchronize its output to a set of other nodes , each of which is also able tosynchronize their output to the rest of the network using only a single pulse , called the pulse - connection function time synchronization is the ability of a subset of nodes in a multi - terminal network to cooperatively predict the time of the next node in the network .<n> we show how to achieve time synchronization in an asymptotically dense network by developing a pulse - transmission estimator that determines the time , in the time scale of @xmath0 , when a node predicts it will see its next zero - crossing . here<n> we establish the conditions for estimating the next integer value of the arrival time of a pulse at a node . synchronization is the problem of having a set of nodes , each with an associated pulse - transmitter , synchronize the arrival times of transmitted pulses in such a way that the predicted arrival time of a pulse at a node is as close as possible to a desired value .<n> we consider a network of nodes that are connected by a pulse - transfer link and wish to synchronize their pulse arrival times , or equivalently , their time synchronization . we show that synchronization can be achieved in a probabilistic way by making use of pulse - state information and pulse - arrival - time estimation . <n> synchronization is a fundamental problem in many areas of science and engineering . in particular ,<n> the synchronization of physical systems , such as optical fibers @xcite or superconducting circuits @xmath0 , is essential for many applications , including high - speed communications , synchronization of complex networks , and synchronization of large numbers of devices such as computers , sensors , etc . here , we will focus on synchronization of optical fibers and superconducting circuits , where the goal is to synchronize the time of optical pulses between two spatially distant nodes . for such a network , it is important that the synchronization is performed accurately and precisely , so that we consider the problem of joint estimation of a pulse and a random variable by a set of nodes connected by time - varying pulses . we show that if the pulse receive time at each node is known , but not yet observed , then the nodes can jointly optimize the estimation of the pulse and the random variable and achieve time synchronization .<n> we also show that the optimal estimation and synchronization algorithms are asymptotically optimal . <n> time synchronization is the process by which a quantum system can be synchronized to a remote quantum system in such a way that the state of the remote system is preserved . in synchronization @xcite , a quantum state is represented by a pair of non - commuting observables : a time variable and a pulse , and the synchronization task is to find a time estimator for the time variable that minimizes the mean squared error between the estimate and the unknown time variable . for a bipartite quantum system ,<n> the time synchronization problem is the same as the state estimation problem , which is the task of finding an estimate of a physical system s state by measuring a single pulse . here , we consider a multipartite system in which at least two nodes are connected by pulse - preserving time - changing pulses  in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the state of a quantum state from noisy observations .<n> we propose a new algorithm , based on time synchronization , that is robust to noise and performs well , on average , in terms of mean squared error , over a wide range of system parameters . <n> state synchronization @xcite is the process by which a quantum system , described by a hilbert space hamiltonian @xmath0 , synchronizes itself to a state in such a way that the state changes at each observation . in a state - to - state synchronization protocol ,<n> the state is represented by the eigenvalues of an auxiliary hilbert matrix , and the time it takes for the state to change is called the synchronization time . for a given state , a node in the state space will seek to estimate the state s time difference , which is then used to estimate a random variable that is a parameter of the state that is parameterized by the state and the observation noise . here<n> , the goal is to minimize the mean - squared error between the estimate and the random variable being estimated . as a result , <n> the estimators are designed to in this paper , we present a synchronization criterion that is unbiased and easy to implement .<n> this criterion can be used to determine whether or not a given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is synchronized with a set of other signals . as an example<n> , this criterion is applied to a single - photon source to determine the snr of a single photon . <n> synchronization is one of the most fundamental principles in quantum information theory . in the original definition of the synchronization criterion @xcite ,<n> the goal is to determine a synchronization condition such that the output of a sequence of quantum bits ( qubits ) will be synchronized to the input of the sequence of bits . for a given snr @xmath0 , a qubit<n> is said to be synchronized if it is output with a probability proportional to @x , where @x is the average snr over all pairs of output qubits in the sequence , and the average is equal to the output with the given probability . since gaussian noise processes are the most common noise processes in the real world , it is natural to ask whether a similar question is also possible in the context of quantum information . to answer in this paper , we derive the optimal unbiased estimator for the fisher information matrix of a linear gaussian noise model .<n> we show that this estimator is efficient , in the sense that it achieves the cramer rao lower bound . <n> [ [ section ] ] unbiased estimators for fisher information matrices are of fundamental importance in statistical mechanics , and have been extensively studied in the literature . in @xcite<n> , it was shown that for a class of linear noise models , the information matrix is uniformly unbiased ( umvu ) , i.e. it has the same asymptotic distribution as the information , @xmath0 , which is given by the fisher matrix . from this result<n> it was conjectured that this unbiased estimator is optimal , for example , this is true for the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of the information of interest in the linear model , given the fisher - information matrix , if the noise model is linear , that is , its coefficients are independent of all other noise samples . however , to the best of our knowledge this is the first unbiased estimation result for the information in this class of models . for a linear model<n>  the problem of joint prediction of the arrival times of optical pulses at a set of optical nodes is considered .<n> it is shown that each node has the ability to predict the next integer value of @xmath0 , if the arrival time of the first pulse is known . a technique for jointly developing the pulse arrival times for all nodes<n> is developed . <n> optical nodes have the capacity to perform high - precision prediction @xcite . in this context ,<n> joint prediction is defined as the ability of a group of nodes , each with a well - defined measurement device , to jointly estimate the values of a number of parameters , such as the position , momentum , and energy of the optical pulses , as a function of the measurement device and the input parameters of the other nodes . here<n> , we consider the joint prediction problem in the following sense : each node wants to estimate the value of a parameter , from which the remaining nodes want to select the next value of this parameter . from this perspective , the joint estimation problem is , in essence , a joint markov chain , where the goal is to achieve the joint maximum likelihood estimate of the input values of the parameters . in this paper , we present a synchronization technique for multi - hop wireless networks .<n> we consider a set of nodes with @xmath0 nodes , where each node has the ability to predict the next integer value of the pulse arrival time at any other node . given a sequence of pulse arrival times , a time synchronization estimator and a pulse - connection function are developed so that the aggregate waveform seen by a node will have the desired properties in the aggregate transmission . under the assumption of no propagation delay ,<n> we show that each node will be able to synchronize its transmission to the next node in the sequence . <n> wireless networks have become an indispensable tool for communication , e.g. wireless local area networks ( wlan ) @xcite , mesh - based wlan @x , and more recently , distributed wlans . in these networks , <n> nodes have access to a large amount of data , which are transmitted over a wireless channel , such as a local area network ( lan ) . as a result<n> , each node is able to send information to its neighbors , using a small amount of bandwidth , in order to increase the capacity of the network . synchronization is the process of maintaining a sequence of equispaced zero - crossings in a dynamical system , such as a wireless network , in the steady state . in this paper<n> , we introduce a synchronization technique that can be used in wireless networks to achieve steady - state synchronization .<n> this technique does not require any information about the location of a node , nor does node need to know its surrounding neighbors . <n> synchronization is a fundamental process in many natural , physical , and social systems , including communication networks , graphs , networks of autonomous oscillators , neural networks . here , time synchronization is defined as the process by which a system in a steady state synchronizes itself so that the system as a whole follows the time synchronization scheme @xcite . time synchronization has been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally , for dynamical systems with time - varying parameters , as well as for systems that are invariant under time evolution . however , until now , there has not been any general theoretical framework that provides a way to design time synchronization methods that are asymptotically steady state in the sense that nodes in the network do not need to synchronize their state to maintain a desired sequence of zero - in this paper , we propose a new approach to the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> we show that , under certain conditions , a pulse with frequency @xmath0 can be distinguished from a background signal with a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 1 at a distance of order 1 cm from the detector . in our approach , the pulse is first transmitted to a set of nodes and then detected by a group of nodes that have an estimator of the pulse location in the time scale of the signal . with this technique ,<n> the detection limit of the gw is determined by the ratio of the frequency of the transmitted pulse to the snr of the background , rather than the pulse frequency . <n> [ sec : intro ] gravitational wave detection is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of gravitational wave astronomy . due to the difficulty in detecting gw s , there has been an increasing interest in using techniques that can extract information about them from a large number of sources , e.g. , gravitational wave detectors @xcite , interferometers @x , and even gravitational - wave - emitting sources such as pulsars @ we study the problem of time synchronization in a multi - hop network where the signals suffer not only from pathloss but also propagation delay .<n> we show that such a network can be used to achieve cooperative time synchronization , i.e. time synchronization that lasts as long as the time scale of the aggregate signal is cooperative . <n> time synchronization is a fundamental concept in time synchronization @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the case where signals in the network suffer from both pathloss and time - delayed propagation . to address this problem ,<n> we introduce the concept of _ time averaging _ , that is , averaging out errors using the large number of nodes in a network . using such a concept<n> we can effectively divide the network into two disjoint sets , a set of interior nodes _ and an interior set _ with _ average _ errors , and thus we can achieve time synchronization even in the presence of propagation delay and pathloss . as a result , in the absence of time - delay , time synchronization can be achieved in the sense that the average signal seen at any given node is time - synchronized with the average signals seen at all the interior nodes in the in this paper , we show that synchronization in a multi - hop network can be averaged out in such a way that the resulting average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is close to unity , i.e. @xmath0 .<n> this is achieved by averaging out a random artificial time shift introduced by each node to average out the propagation delay in the network . <n> synchronization is one of the most important techniques in the study of complex networks @xcite . in such networks ,<n> each node transmits a _ synchronized signal _ to all other nodes that are connected by a small number of _ nearest - neighbor _ connections . for a given network topology , _<n> e.g. _ a ring or a mesh , the performance of synchronization depends on the connectivity of the network and on the number of connections that are required to synchronize the nodes . as a result<n> , there is a trade - off between performance and connectivity . on the one hand , more connectivity<n> is needed to achieve higher performance , but at the same time , less nodes need to be synchronized to achieve the same average snr as a single network with the same number of nodes  in this paper , we present a solution to the problem of time synchronization in a multi - node multi - carrier network .<n> our approach is to average out the effect of random propagation delays on the transmission of a pulse from one node to another . to do this ,<n> we introduce the concept of artificial time shifts at each node to counteract the random time shifts that are introduced by the time delay random variable . at the same time , by the properties of the aggregate waveform , this artificial time shift can be used as an estimator of the time synchronization time scale . as an example application of this approach , the average synchronization time is shown to be @xmath0 . <n> synchronization is one of the most important concepts in the study of complex networks @xcite . in this work , <n> we consider a network of nodes that are connected by a set of _ multi - channel _ links . here<n> , each node acts as a single - carrier , and each node transmits a pulse to its nearest neighbors , which are called the _ nodes_. in order to synchronize the pulses between the nodes , they need to be connected _ in time _ , i.e in this paper , we study the time - synchronization properties of waveforms that are generated by a single node in a cooperative communication network .<n> we introduce a new delay model that is applicable to networks with arbitrary number of interior nodes . using this delay model ,<n> we show that the aggregate waveform generated at any interior node has the following limiting properties : ( 1 ) it is independent from all other pulses ; ( 2 ) the time scale of the waveform is equal to the network time scale ; and ( 3 ) there is no propagation delay . we study the problem of time synchronization in a multi - node network with pulse - connection delay .<n> we show that , for interior nodes , time synchronization with propagation delay can be solved simply by modifying the scaling factor in the pulse connection function . for exterior nodes time synchronization<n> is shown to be possible . <n> time synchronization is one of the most important problems in network science @xcite . in a network of @xmath0 nodes<n> , each node has its own information that can not be accessed by any other node . as a result ,<n> each node needs to synchronize its information with the rest of the network in order to achieve the best performance it can achieve<n> . however , in practice , synchronization is not easy to do . here , we will focus on synchronization of two - way communication networks , where the nodes have access to each other s information , but not their own information . to achieve time synchronization , the nodes need to synchronize their information with each other in such a way that the information transfer from one node to the other is as efficient as possible , i.e. as long as the average information transfer is less than a certain threshold value , called the we present a method for time - synchronization in complex networks with propagation delay .<n> time synchronization is the ability of a network of nodes to synchronize their pulse waveforms so that they remain synchronized throughout the entire network . in the absence of propagation delay<n> , a network can synchronize itself in a steady - state by generating a limiting aggregate waveform that has equispaced zero - crossings at the network s centers . <n> synchronization requires that each node in the network synchronizes its pulse waveform in such a way that the center zero - crossing occurs at an integer value of the time scale of the observations made by each node . for a complex network of @xmath0 nodes ,<n> we show that if each node has a pulse - connection function that is a function of time , then it is possible to develop a time synchronization estimator that takes the pulse observations into account and propagates them through the network in a manner such that the resulting aggregate waveform has the desired limiting behavior at the center of the network and has zero crossings that occur in an integer number of locations throughout the network<n> . however , if the nodes do not have such a pulse connection function , time synchronization can be achieved without propagation delay by having the nodes synchronize their waveforms in this paper , we introduce the concept of time synchronization for a class of multiuser cooperative delay - synchronization protocols .<n> we show that if the number of time nodes in the network is large enough , there is a tradeoff between the ability of each node to synchronize its time to the network s needs and the degree to which the network as a whole synchronizes to meet those needs . <n> time synchronization is the ability for a quantum system to synchronize itself so that the state of the system at a later time is not modified . in quantum information theory , time synchronization plays an important role as a resource for quantum communication and computation @xcite . for quantum networks ,<n> synchronization is important because it allows the nodes in a network to communicate more efficiently , and to synchronize their time to meet the needs of the network more rapidly , compared to when synchronization is not important . to develop time synchronization in a quantum network , it is essential that each node has the ability to estimate the value of some parameter of the waveform that describes the quantum state at the time of the communication between the nodes . if the node knows this parameter , she can use it to synchronize her time to a desired value of the parameter @xmath time synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in many fields of science and engineering .<n> we show that under certain conditions , we can synchronize the nodes of a time - varying network in steady - state . <n> time synchronization has been studied for many years in physics , chemistry , biology , computer science , engineering , social sciences , and finance @xcite . in most cases ,<n> synchronization is considered to be a macroscopic process in which the nodes must synchronize their behavior in order to function properly . however , in many practical applications , such as in robotics , the nodes need to synchronize not only to function correctly , but also to maintain a certain level of synchronization in the face of time - consuming and unpredictable perturbations . here<n> we study the synchronization properties of a network of nodes , where each node is responsible for synchronizing the rest of the network in some sense @xmath0 . for a single - node network<n> , it is known that if all nodes can synchronize , then the network can effectively function as a single physical system . as such , time synchronization of the interior nodes is possible . on the other hand , for a two - dimensional network , synchronization of we analyze the problem of time synchronization in a pulse network .<n> we show that the technique of averaging out timing delay , which has become a standard tool for analyzing pulse networks , can not be applied to the case of a single - hop network because of a number of complications that arise when moving from interior to boundary nodes . <n> time synchronization is one of the most important concepts in the theory of complex pulse networks @xcite . in a network of @xmath0 nodes ,<n> a network node is said to be connected to the rest of the network if and only if a pulse is transmitted from this node at a time that is determined by the average observation made by all interior nodes in the network at the time of that pulse transmission . here<n> , we are interested in pulses that are transmitted at the same time at every interior node , but different from any other pulse that has ever been transmitted in pulse network history . the basic idea behind time synchronization , however , is that a network s pulse waveform is observed by all of its nodes at different times , and each node can estimate the time synchronization of a pulse by counting the number of observations that the pulse made at that time . as a result  time synchronization is a fundamental concept in many areas of science and technology .<n> however , time synchronization in complex networks has been studied only for the case of propagation delay . here , we show that time synchronization can also be maintained in networks with propagation delay provided that the network is synchronized at the boundary nodes . <n> time synchronization , a concept originally introduced to describe the ability of a system to synchronize itself , has recently been applied to a wide variety of problems , including synchronization of complex networks , synchronization of autonomous systems , and many others @xcite . in this work ,<n> we consider the time synchronization problem in a network with arbitrary number of boundary and interior nodes , as well as arbitrary pulse - connection function @xmath0 . for this problem , <n> we derive the conditions under which synchronization can be maintained , under the following two assumptions : ( i ) all interior nodes have the same zero - crossing ; and , ( ii ) each boundary node has the same pulse connection function , which is the same as the interior node s , but which is different from the exterior nodes ; ( iii ) the network can be modeled as a set of @x in this paper we study time synchronization in multi - hop networks with propagation delay .<n> we first present a general framework for time synchronization with time delay using high node density . in this framework<n> we are able to give an elegant presentation of the main concept of this paper which is to use high node densities to average out errors in the network . we then apply this technique to averaging out the inherent errors present in the nodes and provide the network with a sequence of zero - crossings that can serve as synchronization events . to this end<n> we were partially successful in that the interior nodes can average out these errors assuming the boundary nodes have additional information . but this is of interest since the goal of this work is to understand the theory of spatial averaging for synchronization and discover its fundamental advantages and limitations . in this paper , we consider the problem of scalability for time synchronization in finite sized networks with high densities .<n> first , in the regime of high densities ( fixed area , @xmath0 ) we estimate the maximum number of hops over which synchronization information must travel in order to maintain a fully connected network with high probability . using this estimate ,<n> we study how the synchronization error in a generic pairwise synchronization mechanism depends on this number of hoppings . <n> second , using the estimate for the minimum required transmission distance for a network to be fully connected , and then using the evolution of zero - crossings in finite networks to understand what types of synchronization are achievable under the situation where zero - crossing locations evolve in time , the scalability issue is revisited under the light of work developed in this work . to conclude , this work addresses the issue of propagation delay in asymptotically dense networks and characterize the behavior of the network . the main purpose of this work is to provide a different set of tools that will be needed to understand the synchronization types that are achievable in a finite sized network in the high density regime and to characterize the behaviors of networks in general in the case where the number of nodes in the network is finite  in this paper , we consider the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes transmitting simultaneously in a fully connected network in the regime of high densities .<n> we show that in this regime , there is an upper bound on the maximum transmission distance , @xmath0 , that can be achieved by a network of nodes , uniformly distributed over a square , such that the network is connected with probability-1 . using this upper bound ,<n> we are able to find the optimal time of transmission for each node , in terms of the transmission distance and the density of the network , to synchronize the nodes in such a network . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of large - scale networks is an active area of research , with applications ranging from the design of efficient routing protocols to the analysis of the structure of complex networks . in this context , it is important to understand the connection between the topology of a network and its connectivity properties , as this has a direct impact on the performance of the protocols that are used to connect the nodes . from a theoretical point of view<n> , the connection can be understood as follows : a node is connected to its nearest neighbors if and only if its transmission we present a protocol for teleporting quantum information between two distant nodes , each of which is connected to alice and bob , using linear optical elements .<n> we show that the teleportation can be carried out with arbitrarily high efficiency , as long as the distance between nodes is smaller than a certain threshold , which is determined by bob s observation time of the quantum state of alice s qubit . <n> quantum teleportation is an information - theoretic protocol that allows two distant parties , such as a quantum computer , to communicate between each other using a small number of optical elements called nodes @xcite . in this protocol ,<n> two nodes are connected to each other by a small optical element called a node @xmath0 , and alice can use her quantum memory to store the state of the qubit in the form of a wave packet . here<n> , we consider teleportation between two nodes in a quantum network , where each party has one optical element , known as a node , that can be used as a memory for the information that the node is transmitting . we will show that , if bob is able to detect each pulse in the packet , she can determine broadcast synchronization ( rbs ) is an emerging technique for the synchronization of broadcast channels . in this paper<n> , we investigate the synchronization error variance of a set of nodes that are performing broadcast synchronization .<n> we find that the variance of synchronization error increases linearly with the number of nodes . <n> broadcast synchronization is a network synchronization technique in which the transmission of data through a broadcast channel is synchronized between the transmitter and the receivers . here<n> we consider broadcast synchronization with @xmath0 nodes , where each node s clock frequency is assumed to be the same for all the other nodes in the network . for each node<n> s clocks , there is a random variable that is used to estimate the time between the signals . with this random variable ,<n> each node estimates the time that is required for the signal to be transmitted , and this estimate is called the estimate of node ( a node is said to be  synchronized '' if it is able to guarantee that the transmitted signal can be guaranteed to be received with high probability ) . as is well known , each node suffers from jitter , which is an error that depends on the value of the random variable used by the node . however  in this paper , we describe a new time synchronization technique for dense heterogeneous networks .<n> the fundamental idea behind this technique is that by using spatial averaging , the errors inherent in each node can be averaged out . by using observations that are an average \" of the information from a large number of surrounding nodes , synchronization performance can be improved due to the higher quality observations . <n> synchronization is a fundamental operation in many fields , ranging from physics to biology . in particular ,<n> synchronization plays an important role in the heart of cellular automata @xcite , and plays an essential role in synchronization - enhanced neural networks , e.g. , in the area of molecular motors . for many years<n> , it has been thought of as a monolithic \" operation , meaning that each node in a network needs to be prepared in some state and then be able to send information to the other nodes in the network in order to be synchronized . as a result , there has been a trade - off between network designers and engineers : as the network density increases , network designers have more control over synchronization performance , but as the node density grows , engineers have less control over timing errors . here<n>  synchronization is one of the most important problems in wireless networks .<n> unfortunately , there are few general results on how to improve synchronization performance in networks that are both large and finite in size . in this paper , we present a new technique for cooperative time synchronization that takes advantage of spatial averaging . by using observations that are an average \" of the information from a large number of surrounding nodes , synchronization performance can be improved due to the higher quality observations . along these lines ,<n> this paper describes a class of techniques that can take advantage of spatially - averaged signals to improve network synchronization performance . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] synchronization is a fundamental problem in network science that has been studied for more than forty years @xcite . for synchronization to be effective , it is essential that synchronization algorithms be able to handle large numbers of users , large networks , and large delays . as a result<n> , the field of network science has seen tremendous progress in the past few years . among these advances<n> is the development of techniques to analyze synchronization in large networks @xmath0 , to analyze the asymptotic behavior of network synchronization in finite - sized networks @<n> . however , in this paper , we propose a new framework for time - synchronized waveform generation . in this framework ,<n> we show that the expectation of a pulse connection function is bounded as a function of the variance of the connection function .<n> we also show that if we have the ability to control the location of the zero - crossings in the pulse waveform , then we can use this location to synchronize the waveform . in this paper , we show that the sequence of independent random variables @xmath0 is bounded by a sequence of positive numbers .<n> that is , there is a sequence , which is independent of the choice of pulse connection function , of positive values of the variance of the random variables , where the variance ranges from a positive upper bound to a positive lower bound . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain the strong law of large numbers for this sequence . <n> ./style / arxiv -

parameter family of constant curvature dirac fermions which are not conformally invariant . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of a classical result of strichartz @xcite . <n> * introduction . *<n> the dirac equation is one of the most important equations in physics .<n> it describes the behavior of solutions of maxwell s equations in the limit when the number of particles tends to infinity . in this limit<n> , dirac s equation can be expressed in terms of the solutions of the schrdinger equation , which is a maxwell - gauss equation with a dirac field acting on the space of solutions . since the dirichlet boundary condition ( bgc ) for the schrodinger equation is well - known , it is natural to ask if there are other boundary conditions which can be approximated by bgcs . among these<n> is the constant curvature ( cg ) condition , for which there has been a lot of work done in the last two decades ( see e.g. refs . @x in this paper , we show that the solution of the sine - gordon equation in @xmath0 dimensions is riemann integrable .<n> we then use this result to bound the maximum value of the integral associated with this equation . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the solution to a system of ordinary differential equations is a dynamical system if and only if it can be decomposed into a sum and a difference term . in the case<n> that the sum and difference terms are continuous functions , the solutions to the equations are known to be integrable @xcite . as a result ,<n> integrable systems are easy to analyze since the associated integrals can be easily evaluated and the integrability of the system can be studied . on the other hand , in the presence of discontinuities in the solution , it is difficult to analyze the integrals associated with the solution since the solutions are not integrable and one needs to estimate the maximum area contributed by the discontinuity to the solution in order to bound them from above . here<n> we show how to handle this problem in a natural way by using integrability and discontinuity estimates to bound from above the value of a certain integral associated to a given system of in this paper , we show that the lyapunov exponents of a hamiltonian system on a torus are bounded from above .<n> this is done by first bounding the maximum value of an integral over the torus , and then bounding another term that bounds the maximum area contributed by the discontinuities . <n> [ theore]*theorem * in this paper , we study the time -

[ [ section ] ] in this work ,  time - delayed '' waveforms are defined as those waveforms which minimize a given delay in time , i.e. the delay is the sum of the delay of the output and input waveforms . here<n> , a waveform is said to be _ time -synced _ if it is time - synchronous with the input , and _ asynchronous _ otherwise . for a given time - sequence ,<n> a _ s - generator _ ( or _ in this paper , we show that the delay between the arrival of a particle and the detection of its orbital angular momentum is @xmath0 .<n> this is the first proof of the quantization of orbital angular momenta in quantum mechanics . <n> _ introduction. _ quantum mechanics ( qm ) predicts the existence of majorana fermions @xcite , which have been observed in a variety of physical systems , such as cold atoms in an optical lattice , trapped ions , and electrons in quantum dots , to name a few . in the linear response regime ,<n> the problem of detecting a particle s orbital angular velocity ( oam ) is one of the most challenging problems in quantum optics , as it involves time - reversal symmetry breaking , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , the exchange of angular momentum ( aom ) between the particle and its environment and the violation of local hidden variable ( lhv ) theorem . to date , there have been more than twenty proposals for detecting aom in qm and more than ten proposals for solving the soc problem in linear response ( lr ) @x<n> . however , it is in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the weighted sum of two linear regression models .<n> the first model is a linear regression model with @xmath0 variables and the second one is a quadratic regression model , where we assume that the coefficients of the two regression models are independent and identically distributed . <n> we first consider the case where the coefficients are all equal , that is , the case when the two models have the same regression coefficients . in this case<n> , it is known that the solution of the linear regression problem is given by the fixed point of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble . here<n> we show that if the coefficients have non - zero mean and variance , then the solution is also given by a fixed point , which we call the _ fixed - point optimal _ solution . using this result<n> we are able to derive the optimal fixed point for a large class of linear regression problems . as an example , in the case of the quadratic regression problem , this optimal solution can be used to estimate the regression coefficients for the regression models of interest . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce a new family of fixed point optimal solutions , called _<n> fixed - we consider the problem of estimating the size of the largest eigenvalues of a gaussian random field .<n> we assume that the field can be modeled as a linear combination of independent random variables , and the weights of the variables are assumed to be distributed uniformly over the field , so that the mean and the variance of the weights are independent of the sample size . <n> we prove that if the first @xmath0 of the random variables are independent , then the estimated size is equal to the size , up to a constant factor , of the _ largest _ eigenvalue of the field when the field is uniformly distributed . in this case , we show that the estimator is asymptotically equivalent to a _ small - world _ estimator , which is a generalization of the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov - arnold - moser ( ks - am ) estimator . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the large - world estimator to the smallest possible eigen value . +<n> * keywords : * _ large - scale , nonhomogeneous , sparse , random ,",

      "generated": "compact groups of galaxies are small systems of several galaxies in a compact configuration on the sky . over 400 years ago , the palomar observatory sky survey provided a new and extensive resource for the systematic investigation of small groups .<n> over the last 30 years , a total of 376 new compact groups have been discovered , increasing the number of known compact groups by a factor of @xmath0 . among these ,<n> vv 172 is the densest group known , having a median projected galaxy separation of only 1 kpc . compact groups of galaxies , as defined by shakhbazian ( 1973 ) , are the most numerous class of objects of possible dark matter .<n> although interest in them is growing , interest in the first compact groups was quite limited . when redshifts were measured for galaxies in these systems , surprises were found , both in stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet contain a galaxy with a discordant redshift . a new problem is the presence of a foreground or background galaxy , which is often projected within the compact systems . <n> the observations can of course also be explained if the bulk of the mass is in a non - visible form . however ,<n> as pointed out by limber and mathews ( 1960 ) and later by arp ( 1987) ? <n> are these examples of physical association between objects of widely different redshift? even if the discordant galaxies are ignored , the velocity dispersions of these systems are generally higher than would be expected given their visible mass . a review of the observations of compact groups of galaxies is presented , along with methods of identification and surveys that have been made .<n> observed properties of these systems are discussed , as well as their interpretation in terms of the nature of the dark matter and the dynamical evolution of galaxies in these systems . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in in recent years , there has been great progress in surveys for compact groups of galaxies .<n> these systems are small , relatively isolated , systems of four or five galaxies in close proximity to one another , and have a range of galaxy density and population . in this review ,<n> the properties of the groups are summarized , observed properties are discussed , the interpretation of the observations is discussed and implications of these results are addressed . we re - examine the 100 groups of galaxies that were found by hickson s ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) criteria , and show that the selection criteria introduce strong distance - dependent biases in the sample .<n> we find that @xmath0% of the groups actually satisfy the criteria . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' the completeness of the faint - end ( @xmath0 ) component of the hickson - kron - cousins catalog ( hcg ) is examined .<n> it is found that the catalog becomes significantly incomplete at magnitudes fainter than about 13 , and at surface brightnesses as low as about 15 . <n> the catalog contains a few mis - identifications , such as compact galaxies mistaken for stars and marginal violations of the isolation criteria . in addition , when photometry was obtained for the galaxies in the catalog , it was found that some groups would not satisfy the selection criteria if photometric magnitudes are used . we have applied a friends - of - friends algorithm to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey in order to identify a sample of compact groups of galaxies .<n> the groups are defined as sets of connected galaxies having projected separations of less than 10 kpc and line - of- sight velocity differences of 1000 km s@xmath0 or less . <n> the resulting sample consists of 89 redshift - selected compact groups ( rscgs ) . the median projected separation of the sample is 9.4 kpc , and the velocity dispersions of the members are typically in the range 1000 to 1500 km<n> s @xmath1 , with a median value of 1500 km . at fainter magnitudes ,<n> the number of groups in the sample increases significantly , so that the total sample is about twice as large as that found by a purely subjective search , even taking into account the effects of incompleteness and magnitude spread of the groups . for the projected - separation range 10 - 20 kpc the median velocity dispersion of the group is 1000 to 3000 km _<n> fwhm _ , but the groups have much larger dispersions than the sample as a whole , suggesting that the velocity - dispersion hickson et al ( 1992 ) have used an angular - selection technique to find compact groups of galaxies in the virgo cluster ( hcg ) .<n> we have extended this technique to a redshift - selection method , which finds groups by means of a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey . <n> the sample is complete to @xmath0 , and the median redshift of the redshift selected compact groups ( rscgs ; barton et al 1996 ) is 0.02 , consistent with that of the hcgs . the median velocity difference between the members of a compact group<n> is 1000 km s@xmath1 , with a median velocity dispersion of 1000 km<n> s.e . for the sample as a whole , the median distance between the brightest group member and the rest of the group , as well as the projected velocity difference of the two brightest members , are 1000 kms.se . at a given redshift ,<n> the median virgo density of the scgs is @xxmath2 mpc , placing most of them at distances well beyond virgo ; however , there is a the redshift - space and environment information provided by vennik et al .<n> ( 1993 ) and ramella et al ( 1994 ) for the red - sequence cluster galaxies ( rscgs ) provides important clues to their nature . in this paper<n> , we examine the properties of galaxies in the hcgs ( @xmath0 ) in order to determine whether they are in groups or clusters of galaxies . <n> we find that the median redshift of the galaxies in compact groups is @x , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) . however ,<n> because of the isolation criterion , these galaxies have rather different kinematical and morphological properties than do those in clusters , so one might justifiably argue that small clumps of galaxies within clusters are not compact groups . also , because compact groups trace large - scale structure , it is also clear that they prefer low - density environments . the surface density of galaxies surrounding compact groups shows no statistically significant excess of nearby neighbors ( sulentic 1987 , rood & williams ( 1989 , kindl 1990 , and palumbo et al 1995 )<n> . this is not the velocity distribution of galaxies in the catalog of hickson et al ( 1992 ) for the brightest cluster galaxies ( hcg ) indicates that the majority of group velocities fall within a roughly gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , with a flat component to the core .<n> this characteristic velocity is quite similar to velocity dispersions found in loose groups , and much smaller than typical velocity dispersion in rich clusters . however , because of the small number of galaxies , dynamical conclusions about systems containing only four or five galaxies are highly uncertain . statistical analysis of large homogeneous samples , based on data for almost all 462 galaxies with measured velocities ,<n> shows that the distribution of galaxy velocities falls within a gauss - hermite distribution with standard deviation , @xcite , of the median value . in addition , a significant fraction of velocities fall in the  flat - core ' region . <n> the velocity dispersion of the hcg galaxies is found to be significantly smaller than the dispersions seen in clusters of similar luminosity , indicating short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters<n> . this result is not inconsistent with we present a study of the velocity , spatial distribution , luminosity function , and mass - to - light ratio of a sample of @xmath0 compact groups , selected from the catalogue of hickson et al ( 1992 ) .<n> the velocity distribution of the group galaxies shows a flat component , which contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies , as well as a velocity dispersion which is roughly gaussian , with a standard deviation of about 1000 km s@xmath1 . after removing this  discordant '' component<n> , we find that the total mass within the region occupied by the galaxies is on the order of a few hundred solar masses , similar to values found for hcgs in other shakhbazian groups ( tikhonov 1986 , amirkhanian & egikian 1987 , lynds et al 1990 ) and in several rich clusters . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in the nature of compact groups of galaxies is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , rubin et al 1991 ;

group galaxies is consistent with that for ellipticals in clusters , with the exception that the luminosity function of spiral galaxies in groups appears to be significantly deficient in fainter magnitudes , while that of the scgs is enhanced . in terms of the two parameters , the luminosity functions of compact groups and clusters can be fit by power laws of the form : @xcite , where the logarithm of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy is defined as @x,@xmath1 , and the characteristic star formation rate ( sfr ) in a galaxy is given by the value of the star formation threshold in the galaxy s disk . for a galaxy in a compact group with @x we present deep @xmath0 ccd images of the two most compact groups of galaxies known , the pleiades and the fornax complex .<n> the data were obtained as part of a project to study the kinematics and morphologies of groups with more than four galaxies . <n> we find that for the pleiiades compact groups ( pccgs ) the velocity dispersions are larger than 200 km s@xmath1 and the half -

to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . moreover ,<n> the detected compact groups all contained a majority of early - type galaxies . diffuse x - ray emission has recently been detected in a large number of spiral - rich compact groups , suggesting that the diffuse emission is mostly primordial and not derived from the galaxies . the correlation between temperature , velocity dispersion , and spiral fraction in these systems appears to be consistent with a single relation for clusters and groups .<n> the total mass in compact groups typically exceeds the stellar and gas mass by an order of magnitude . <n> # 1 # 2 _ mem . soc . astron . it . in this paper we consider the nature of the discordant population of galaxies in compact groups of galaxies . we show that the number of discordant galaxies in groups with @xmath0 mag is very low , and that their contribution to the local x -

2.0 kev ) is significantly lower than that of a control sample of rosam - only galaxies , with a median ( 0.5 - 2 kev)@xmath1 erg s@xcite for the brightest group . the median value of the 210 kev luminosity of the compact groups is only about half that of the control sample , suggesting that the groups are in fact not as dense as they appear , even if they are physically dense . for the second group<n> , we find a correlation between the diffuse x - rays luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the group ; the diffuse emission is @x in hernquist et al ( 1995 ) , a sample of groups selected on the basis of high apparent galaxy space density was found to be biased by the inclusion of looser systems which appear more compact due to geometrical or kinematic effects . however , even if compact groups are physically dense , they may not be as dense as they appear . we estimate the magnitude of this apparent space density bias using analytic expressions derived by walke & mamon ( 1989 ) and show that it is not large . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present a study of the spatial distribution of shakhbazian groups in the local universe .<n> this study is based on a sample of groups selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , covering the redshift range @xmath0 . <n> we find that the spatial distributions of the groups in this sample are quite different , with some groups being more centrally concentrated than others , and some not at all . in particular , there is a clear overdensity in the central regions of some groups , which we interpret as a sign of ongoing infall of galaxies from the environment into their overdense cores . on the other hand ,<n> the distribution of groups is not significantly different from that of individual galaxies , nor is the overdensity distribution of triplets , quartets and pairs , suggesting that triplets and quartets are not distinct entities in the galaxy clustering hierarchy , but rather an intermediate stage between loose groups and triplets and pairs and individual galaxies ( ebeling et al 1995 , cavaliere et al 1991 , rampazzo & sulentic 1992 , diaferio et al 1994 ) shakhbazian loose groups appear to be small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . both n - body and hydrodynamic simulations indicate that galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times . the majority of galaxies in compact groups appear to be in the process of merging .<n> this conclusion is based on a comparison of the optical luminosities , rotation curves , colors , and frequencies of optical and merging signatures for galaxies in the same group . we present the results of a deep @xmath0 image of the compact group ngc 6946 .<n> we find that the galaxy distribution within the group is quite peculiar : we find two distinct clumps of galaxies , one of which is coincident with the brightest galaxy in the group , and the other which is not associated with any group member . <n> we have also obtained a deep image of this group in @xcite which reveals a large overdensity of galaxies in the central part of the group and a large excess of faint galaxies along the line of sight to the group center . at first glance , the morphology and spectra of these two galaxies appear normal . however , after careful examination of the images we conclude that they are in fact two galaxies in an interacting system . the color of the excess galaxies is consistent with them being in the process of a small - scale ( a few kpc ) tidal disruption ( pildis 1995 ) . we estimate the total mass of the system to be @xxmath1 and the total luminosity of the two galaxies to be , in fact , equal , thus indicating that the system is in the early stages of tidal disruption . in this paper<n> we we present the results of a search for hii regions in three @xmath0-band selected groups of galaxies : hcg 31 , hcg 44 , and hcg 54 .<n> we find hi in extended hi clouds in two of the groups , but not in the third . <n> # 1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present a catalog of quasars and agn in the redshift range @xmath0 which are presumed to lie in or near fossil compact groups .<n> the groups are selected from the catalogue of the hamburg - cousins ( hcg ) group of galaxies , and have at least one starburst galaxy , agn , or both . <n> the properties of the compact groups are often consistent with the expected end - product of mergers between compact groups and isolated elliptical galaxies . for example , the integrated luminosities of compact - group galaxies are typically a factor of three to four times greater than those of luminous elliptical galaxies ( sulentic and rabaa 1994 ) . at redshifts @xcite ,<n> the comoving number density of qsos peaks , while the co moving number density for compact groups peaks . in this redshift regime<n> , there is a tendency for compact group galaxies to have close companions . several recent examples of associations between starburst galaxies or agn and what appear to be compact groups have been reported : del olmo & moles ( 1991 ) find that the luminous infrared source iras 23532 coincides with a compact group that includes a  tidally - triggered star formation appears to be a predominant factor in the galaxy formation process . in this model disk star formation<n> occurs relatively late , after the compact group has formed and tidal interactions are strong .<n> this seems at least qualitatively consistent with the fragmentary nature of high - redshift galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope , although these fragments appear to be much less luminous and more irregular than most present - day compact group galaxies . <n> the model also offers a possible explanation for the excess numbers of faint blue galaxies found in field galaxy count as dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of @xmath0 . at the other end of the scale , dwarf galaxies<n> have physical properties distinct from normal galaxies , which suggests a unique formation mechanism . from an examination of condensations in tidal tails , hunsberger et al ( 1996 ) , concluded that the fraction of dwarf galaxies produced within tidal debris in compact groups is about 40% . here<n> , we explore the possibility that dwarf galaxies form during gravitational interactions from tidal debris , and find support for this formation mechanism at the redshifts of interest for qsos , infrared galaxies and compact groups . the model suggests that giant galaxies we have obtained deep images of the small galaxy group ngc 7252 ( whitmore et al 1993 ) with the ctio 4 m and the keck ii 8 m telescopes .<n> we find that the group is composed of 3 early - type galaxies and 2 late - types which are members of the group . <n> we have also obtained a deep @xmath0 image of the same group with the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 m telescope . from this image<n> , we have found 3 possible cluster members , one of which is likely to be associated with the group as a whole , while the other two appear to be members of an extragalactic cluster which is spatially offset from the group axis . during the last two decades we have seen a resurgence of interest in compact groups . while initially little more than a curiosity , these systems are now viewed as potentially important sites of dynamical evolution , shaping the structure of many galaxies .<n> they form by gravitational relaxation processes within looser associations of galaxies , and are generally in an advanced stage of evolution characterized by strong interactions , starburst and agn activity , stripping of stellar and dark matter halos , or merging . they contain large amounts of dark matter and primordial x - ray - emitting gas trapped within the gravitational potential well . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in i present a review of the properties of compact groups of galaxies .<n> compact groups evolve through a series of stochastic processes that can be described as follows : ( 1 ) the group accretes matter from the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; ( 2 ) amirkhanian and tikhonov - na - shakhbazian ( tsh ) instability strips material from the group ; and ( 3 ) ram pressure stripping from the ism causes the group to fragment into smaller fragments , each of which can later be accreted by the host galaxy . in the local universe , compact groups are found in abundance at high redshifts , and their properties are expected to be similar to those of the large scale structure . however , in the present epoch , there is little direct evidence for the existence of such relics . <n> # 1_#1 _ # 1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in in the framework of the amirkhanian scenario of the early universe , we show that the redshifts of quasars observed in the literature are consistent with the predictions of the scenario , provided that the cosmic baryon density @xmath0 is not too high . <n> [ a]in 1966 , tikhonov na , shakhbazian , _ astrofizika _ 35:67 -

known gravitational wave background ( gwb ) , which is due to the incoherent interaction between the microwave photons and the gravitational field of the rotating dark matter ( dm ) dominated universe ; on the other hand , it is widely accepted that dark energy is a cosmological constant , whose scale is set by the scale of the hubble expansion . however , this scale is not the same as the in this paper , we study the power spectrum of the redshift - space distortions ( rsds ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies .<n> we find that the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath0 , is strongly affected by the non - gaussianity of the cmb fluctuations . in the case of a scale - invariant primordial spectrum of fluctuations ,<n> we show that the power - spectrum amplitude is strongly dependent on the primordial spectral index . for a flat universe , the primordial spectrum is of power - law form , with a spectral index in the range 1.45 , and a power spectrum amplitude larger than the value derived from cmb observations . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present new kinematical data on the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) obtained with the iram 30 m telescope .<n> the velocity dispersion of the galaxy is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which corresponds to a velocity width of @xcite . <n> this galaxy is one of the most massive in the local group of galaxies ( lmg ) , with a stellar mass of @.4@xcite and a total luminosity of @ . in this paper<n> we present a study of the distribution of the velocities and velocity dispersions of the bulge and of the disk of this galaxy , based on a new analysis of the high resolution data of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and very large array ( vla ) on the two -

light radius of only 0.08 kpc , and an apparent velocity difference of only 23 km s@xmath1 . <n> the presence of two interacting galaxies of similar luminosity and mass within a compact cluster is not surprising , given the relative scarcity of galaxies of comparable mass in the local universe . however , we find that the relative velocity between the two galaxies is unusually high , as compared to the mean velocity of the cluster , suggesting that the galaxies are in an early stage of interaction . in a compact group of galaxies<n> , each galaxy is embedded in a larger galaxy group , which can be seen as a projection of the larger group . as a result ,<n> the galaxies in the group form a _ single _ galaxy system , rather than a pair , in which the galaxies form a single , isolated system . for compact groups of galaxies @xcite , the velocity dispersion of the individual galaxies is very low , @x we study the galaxy distribution in the central region of the cluster of galaxies ngc 6946 .<n> we find that the velocity dispersion of the intracluster medium is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which is one of the largest dispersions among clusters of galaxies known so far . <n> the velocity field of a group of galaxies can be described as a superposition of two velocity components , one component which is radially biased and the other which is tangentially biased . in the inner region of a galaxy cluster ,<n> the two components are well approximated by a single component , while in the outer region , where the velocity difference between the components is large , they are well represented by a two - component model , with a radial velocity dispersion which is a small fraction of the total cluster velocity dispersion . as a result<n> , the central velocity dispersion can not be determined from the cluster velocity field alone . we present a new method to determine the line - of - sight velocity distribution of galaxies in compact groups of galaxies .<n> this method is based on the fact that the velocity field of a group of galaxies can be decomposed into a number of components , each of which can be traced to a different position within the group . using this method<n> , we have found that the average velocity dispersion of the whole group is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which is in good agreement with the sandage formula for the dispersion of a single galaxy . <n> compact groups (cgs ) of galaxies are ideal laboratories to study galaxy formation and evolution because they are relatively small systems with only a few members . in these groups ,<n> the formation of a central black hole ( bh ) can be studied by studying the kinematics and dynamics of the galaxies and their environment . as a result of the interaction between the bh and the host group , a large number of galaxies<n> are formed in a short period of time , and their global properties such as velocity dispersion , size , mass , etc . can be derived from the distribution of their galaxies @xcite . to study the global properties of we report the discovery of a galaxy pair in the process of merging .<n> the pair , consisting of an early -

vlt and the ntt , respectively . the stellar velocity distribution is found to be very complex , consisting of at least four components , each of which can be associated with a different stellar population . for each component<n> the velocity dispersion is computed , as a function of distance from the nucleus , from the position of the peak of the velocity distribution , in this letter , we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be written as a sum of two terms .<n> the first one is proportional to the energy density of the universe and the second one is a linear combination of the eos and a scalar field . in a recent paper @xcite , it was shown that the scalar field in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model of the early universe can be approximated by a power - law in energy density , with an exponent close to unity . this result , together with the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and anisotropy ,<n> strongly suggests that the universe is flat and accelerating , as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) . however , the cosmological constant problem , i.e. the existence of a cosmological constant , has not been solved yet . <n> recently , several authors have considered the possibility of an eos with a negative pressure , in which the pressure of the fluid in the center of the frw universe is negative and the fluid pressure is positive , to explain the flatness of the cm we present the results of a numerical study of the galactic rotation curve in the framework of the adiabatic theory of gravity .<n> we find that the galactic rotational curve at @xmath0 is well described by a model in which the rotation of the milky way is due to the gravitational acceleration of a central black hole . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of galactic rotation curves ( rcss ) is one of the most important tools to test the general relativity ( gr ) and the nature of the black hole ( bh ) in the universe . in particular ,<n> the rotation curve of the galaxy @xcite is of particular interest because it is directly related to the gr parameters , i.e. , the mass of the central bh and the speed of light , and it can also be used to test whether the gr is correct or whether there is some breakdown of the gr in the early stages of the universe ( see , for example , refs . and references therein ) . since the early 1970s , rotating black holes (  bhs)@xcite have been the subject of a great deal of interest , both theoretically and observationally , because we present the results of numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of a massive star .<n> the calculations are performed in the framework of the linear theory of mhd , including the effect of black hole evaporation . in the case of the collapse of an isolated massive star<n> , we find that the mass of the collapsing body is of the order of @xmath0 , and that the collapse timescale is of order the sound crossing time . <n> black hole ( bh ) collapse is one of the most fascinating and fundamental astrophysical phenomena @xcite . during the course of a stellar collapse ,<n> the energy input from the black hole becomes negligible compared to the gravitational energy , which is proportional to the volume of the event horizon at the time of collapse . as a result , the collapse is fast , within a few microseconds , even for the most compact bhs . on the other hand , for larger bh masses<n> the collapse may become very slow , much slower than the sound speed , depending on the initial conditions . for an isolated bh , in the limit of a very slow initial velocity dispersion , a large fraction of the initial energy of the bh can be converted into gravitational energy we present the results of numerical simulations of the collision of two massive black holes ( bhs ) in the framework of the adiabatic theory of accretion .<n> the bhs are assumed to be in circular motion with respect to the center of the accreting gas . in the case of the resonant bh - bh collision ,<n> the relativistic effects are taken into account . <n> [ [ section ] ] black hole ( bh ) accretion is one of the most important processes in the history of the universe . during the last decades<n> , bh accretion has been studied with great detail both from the theoretical and observational points of view . at present , the bh accretion rate is of the order @xmath0 yr@xmath1 @xcite , which is much higher than the accretion rate of an ordinary stellar mass bh , and much less than the rate of accretion of an intermediate mass bh ( imbh ) , where the latter is known to be much lower than the former . the accretion of matter onto an imbh is accompanied by the formation of a geometrically thin shell , called the accretion disk , whose thickness is proportional to the mass of the imbh and inversely proportional to in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are due to large - scale power - law fluctuations .<n> the cmb temperature fluctuations , on the other hand , are dominated by the integrated - sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect . in this paper<n> , we study the effect of non - gaussianity of the primordial density perturbations on the evolution of the galaxy power spectrum . <n> we show that the non - gaussian primordial perturbations lead to a characteristic spectrum with a sharp cut - off at a redshift of about two . at this redshift ,<n> the primordial power spectrum is very flat , with a spectral index @xcite of @x.1 , and a tensor - to - scalar ratio of about 2 , as observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . as a result , at high redshifts , when the primordial tensor power spectrum becomes steeper than the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) spectrum , there is a sharp cutoff in the power spectrum and the spectral index of the gb spectrum we present the results of numerical simulations of galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interactions in the frame of the _ russian astr .<n> _ ( atlas of interacting galaxies , part ii ) , _ astron . _<n> ( ref . 1 ) and _ new haven : yale univ .

called superfamily , can be identified with the family of individuals evolving under model r. in this paper<n> , we consider another class of families , that of the families evolving under models r , m and rm @xcite . as in the case of alignments and other superfamily members , _<n> we consider the problem of identifying alignments in spanning forests . we give a complete answer to the question of identifiability , that is , the degree to which there is an alignment in @xmath0-space that is not induced by some other alignment .<n> we also give a partial solution to the same question for undirected spanning forest sequences . <n> * keywords : * spanning forest , alignment , spanning forest sequence , undirected forest sequence the identification of alignments is one of the most important unsolved problems in the study of spanning forests @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a different approach to the identification problem , one that is based on the analysis of the probability distribution induced by a sequence of alignment events , rather than on the distribution of the recombination events themselves . to answer the question ,<n> we introduce the notion of a _ pedigree _ , ( i.e. , an induced sequence of events ) . a pedigree is said to be identifiable under a model if it is distinguished from every other pedigree in the model . for a pedigree<n> s model parameters , it is also identifiable under the model if all pairs of pedigrees are distinguished from we consider directed directed @xmath0-forests , hidden markov models ( hmms ) , and pedigrees of arbitrary size .<n> we define the notion of identifiability of a sequence of alignments on the space of sequences as well as stronger notions of identification , such as class and pedigree . we show that hmm models are identifiable if and only if the sequence of observed alignments can be interpreted as a pedigree on which the sequence has evolved . <n> we also show that if the size of a pedigree is fixed , then the class and the pedigree size ( typically defined by the number of observed states ) can be estimated from the model parameters . for the case of a directed forest ,<n> the class of all pedigrees is identifiable , but the class can not be identified with the set of known alignments . in the hmm setting , we are able to identify any pedigree of any size with model parameters that are the same as those of the model r and rm on the pedigree , provided that the observed states are in a set of hidden states that are at least as large as the observed state of the rm . on the other hand , for a pedigree of we show that hidden markov models ( hmms ) can be used to reconstruct genetic sequences from the probability distribution on the alignments on extant vertices .<n> we also show that certain haploid pedigrees are reconstructible from the correlation between extant sequences . <n> [ [ section ] ] the task of reconstructing a genetic sequence is one of the most important in evolutionary biology . in the case of sequence reconstruction ,<n> the task is particularly challenging when the sequence is very short , such as for example when there are only a few molecules present , or when the number of sequences is very large , as is the case in bioinformatics , where there are hundreds of thousands or millions of sequences @xcite . for a sequence to be reconstructible , it is important to understand the structure of the sequence , and in particular , to reconstruct the sequence with the minimum number of hidden states , i.e. , the least number of states required to reconstruct it . to this end<n> , there has been an enormous amount of work in the last few years , both theoretical and experimental , trying to understand how to reconstruct a sequence that has as few as @xmath0 hidden states @x we introduce a new family of models for the reconstruction of ancestral sequences .<n> the models are based on markov chains on trees . in the first model , we assume that the lineages are diploid and haploid , and that the transition probabilities between lineages depend only on the vertices of the lineage , not on the sequence itself . <n> [ section ] [ thm]proposition [ rdm]corollary [ ndm]lemma [ ldm]conjecture [ wdm]remark [ theorem]assumption [ theorem ] # 1 # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#20=1=to0@xmath0#2#1 -

squared error ( mse ) @xcite of a uniform random variable is defined as the smallest possible value of the mse of that random variable over all possible in this paper , we obtain a new and tight lower bound on the number of terms in an alignment of length @xmath0 , which is the minimum length of a sequence of non - negative integers .<n> we also show that this lower bound is asymptotically sharp . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction. _<n> the problem of finding lower bounds on the length of sequences of nonnegative integers has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in general<n> , it is hard to bound the length , because the length is an infinte measure of the complexity of the sequence , and in general , one can only obtain lower bounds by solving a system of polynomial equations . here<n> we consider the following problem : given a sequence @x , is it possible to find a sequence s lengths , such that the sequences of lengths at most two are less than or equal to each other ? <n> the following question has been raised by many authors : what is the minimal length of an alignment , i.e. , the sequence of lengths of consecutive non - positive integers that are required to make the sequence at least as long as possible ? a hidden markov model ( hmm ) is defined by two components , one of which is a probability density function ( pdf ) , and the other is a markov chain .<n> we prove that if @xmath0 is a non - negative real number , then the two components of the hmm have the same pdf . moreover<n> , we show that if the two component hmm has the same probability density , than the length of the alignment of the two hmm components is at most @xcite . <n> markov chains have been extensively used to model random processes , such as random walks , random injections , etc . in this<n> setting , it is natural to ask whether a random process can be approximated by a markovian process , i.e. , a hidden model ( hm ) with the same distribution as the random process . to answer this question ,<n> it is useful to consider hms which are hidden from direct inspection , but may be observed by a human being . a hm is defined as follows : a random variable is defined to be the product of two real numbers , which may be viewed as a probability we show that a sequence evolving from one hidden state to another can be described by a hidden markov chain , if and only if the initial distribution of the chain on the sequence is the same as that of the evolving state . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction .<n> _ markov chains ( mcs ) are central to our understanding of the structure of complex , non - commutative dynamical systems @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a more general class of mcs defined by _ hidden states _ , i.e. sequences of random variables that are independent and identically distributed conditional on a transition matrix @xmath0 , where the _ observation _ is the sequence of random variable values taken from the hidden state of the mc . a _<n> hidden state _ can be regarded as an evolving sequence of hidden variables , which are independent random variables conditional on the transition matrix , and whose space sequences take values in the complex plane . here ,<n> we denote the class of evolving sequences by models r and rm for sequences evolving _ from _ one ( hidden ) state to _ another _ ( hidden we define a new class of stochastic processes that we call hidden markov models ( hmms ) , in which the observed states are hidden states and the transition matrices are permutation matrices .<n> we prove that if a sequence evolving on a  pedigree '' evolves on the hmm up to equivalence , then the initial distribution on hidden states is the same as the distribution on the space sequences of observed states . <n> : if @xmath0 is the length of a column vector in a high - dimensional hilbert space , the class of models in this definition is equivalent to a hmm with the same parameters as , for example , a random gaussian process . the class is defined by : ( i ) the number of columns in the high - dimension , ( ii ) a constraint on the lengths of columns , and ( iii ) an upper bound on the size of the  spanning forests '' ( hidden states ) that are undirected on the pedigree . we show that if the sequence evolves on a pedigree , but the set of spanning forests is unknown ( e.g. , it is an unknown set of hidden states for which there are no recombination events  we introduce a family of stochastic processes in which random alignments are added to a spanning forest to account for recombinations among the long - lived alignments .<n> we call this process _ random alignment recombination_. we show that the probability that a random alignment is added to an undirected spanning forest is a power of the distance between the first two sites to the end of the forest , and that the distance is a function of the number of alignments added . as an application<n> , we demonstrate that a simple monte carlo algorithm can be used to determine the optimal distance between two alignments for a given number of recombination events . <n> random alignment ( ra ) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biology , chemistry , engineering , physics and even planetary sciences @xcite . in the simplest version of ra ,<n> a population of individuals evolves on a forest @xmath0 , where each individual is assumed to have evolved on at least one other individual s forest . if the population size is sufficiently small , then all individuals on the forest are equally likely to evolve on the same forest ; otherwise , all individuals have the same probability of evolving on all the forests in the population . on the we show that hidden minimal models ( hmms ) are not necessarily symmetric .<n> more precisely , we prove that if @xmath0 is a hmm that is  classically '' symmetric , then there is an uncountably many hidden states that are not symmetric ; moreover , these hidden states are more likely to have evolved in the past than are the corresponding classical symmetric states . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem)conjecture _ introduction _ <n> the study of the evolution of hidden states is one of the central problems in discrete mathematics , and has found a number of applications in recent years . in this paper<n> we consider a particularly interesting class of hidden models : hmm s ( see @xcite for a review ) . these are discrete dynamical systems in which a hidden variable evolves in its state under the action of a markovian dynamics , but in which the initial distribution of the hidden variable is known only up to relabelling of its states , so that the model can be described by a single transition probability . for these models ,<n> it is well known that there are three classes of symmetric hidden we consider a pedigree with @xmath0 arcs , and show that there is a constant term in the generating function of characters emitted from alignments of length @math1 , which is linear in the number of arcs .<n> we also show that the constant term is independent of the length of alignments . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem)corollary this paper is concerned with the generation of sequences of characters from sequences of points on an automaton . here<n> we consider the pedigree , a toy model of a two - level system . in the pedigree<n> , each point can be generated by concatenating alignments from an undirected set of points in the unit interval . for each point ,<n> the output of the automaton is a sequence of characters , called _ characters _ , emitted from an aligned set of the points . as shown in section [ sec : intro ] , the character generation process is _ non - local _ in the sense that the local character is not preserved if the local alignments are concatenations of the original alignments<n> this means that the emitted characters are not preserved . the hidden markov model ( hmm ) is a simple model of recombination - recombination interactions in condensed matter physics .<n> we study the hmm from the point of view of probability distributions on the space of alignments under the model . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of discrete - time quantum systems has led to the emergence of the theory of random matrix models ( rm ) @xcite , which are a generalization of the well - known poincar - birkhoff - girardeau ( pbg ) model of random walks on the real line . in this paper , we focus on the h mm as an example of a non - gaussian , non - equilibrium , many - body quantum system , in which rm plays the role of a model parameter . as a first step ,<n> we show how to construct a probability distribution on a certain class of rm called the _ pedigree _ , whose invariants can be computed from the distribution . then we discuss how to apply the construction to other pedigrees , and show how the construction of the pedigree may be used to understand the behavior of the model in the long - time limit  we introduce a new model of recombination , called model rm ( recombination recombination on alignments ) , which generalizes the well - known turing model .<n> we show that the probability distribution on the space of alignments under rm can be computed from the distribution of site - specific spanning forests . as an application<n> , we compute the @xmath0-polynomial invariants of pedigrees ( sequences of sites with the same number of arcs ) under model rms . <n> recombination is one of the most important processes in biology , chemistry , and physics . in particular ,<n> recombination plays a crucial role in the evolution of organisms @xcite , from bacteria to human beings . on the one hand , it is crucial to understand the recombination mechanism in order to understand how organisms evolve , how they adapt to the changing environment and how they respond to changes in their local environment , e.g. , changes in diet , pressure , or interaction with the environment . the recombination model ( rm ) introduced by turing ( see figure [ m - rm - sg ] ) is a classic example of recombination in biology @x we present a probabilistic approach to the problem of evolutionary homotopy on trees .<n> we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between alignments of trees and recombinations in trees , and that the probability of evolution of alignments is given by the product of recombination probabilities of segments that have evolved on trees of different length . <n> [ [ section ] ] evolutionary dynamics is concerned with the self - organization of a set of evolving entities into a sequence of structures ( e.g. , a cell into a tree ) @xcite . in the simplest case of a population of identical organisms ,<n> the evolution of a single individual is described by a tree of @xmath0 structures ( trees ) , which are phylogenetic trees in the sense that each tree is associated with one organism in the population . on the other hand , in more complex situations , such as in evolution of species , the evolutionary dynamics of organisms<n> may be more complicated . for example , it is well - known that a single cell may evolve into many cells @x<n> . moreover , there may be a large number of cells in a population , with each cell having its own evolutionary path  we propose a new approach to the problem of alignment in sequences of trees .<n> the approach is based on the following observation : if a sequence of trees is made up of segments that have evolved on spanning forests of length @xmath0 , then its probability of alignment is equal to the product of probabilities of its segments that evolved on these spanning forests . <n> [ eq - pa - ub2 ] this is the main result of the paper : we prove that if the number of segments of the sequence is less than a certain threshold , the probability of the alignment is the same as the sum of the probabilities of the segments of their adjacent segments , which evolved on the spanning forest . as an application<n> , we derive a new upper bound on the size of the set of trees for which alignment is not possible , and we show that this upper bound is asymptotically sharp . [ lem - seq ] the following statement was claimed by a number of authors :  _ let s consider sequences of tree graphs . for a given graph , if there exists a spanning subgraph of the graph that is not an edge of the tree , but is at least as far we prove that if @xmath0 is a tree , then there exists a sequence of undirected paths in which consecutive paths are non - isomorphic .<n> this answers a question of edels @xcite . <n> .2 in the consistency of a tree is the property that every path in the tree has the same length , shape , and topology . in classical tree theory<n> , consistency means that a tree can be proved to be true if and only if every path of the tree is guaranteed to have the same type , size , direction , path - length distribution , or topology ( see definition [ eq - eps0 ] in section [ sec - consistency ] ) . for classical trees ,<n> consistency has been shown to hold in the case when the number of paths is at most two . however , this is not the case for tree - consistency in general ; in particular , it has not been proved in the classical case , when there are infinitely many paths , even in the most general case . here , we show that consistency holds in general in the following sense : if two trees are consistent , there exists an undirected in this paper , we investigate the probability distribution of @xmath0-recombinations in a forest of non - isomorphic sequences ( spanning forest ) .<n> we prove that the distribution is gaussian if and only if the forest is isomorphic to the forest of isomorphisms between the sequences , i.e. , if the distribution has a well - defined consistency condition . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to give a lower bound for the probability that there are exactly @x , and an explicit formula for the distribution . <n> [ [ section ] ] recombination is one of the most important decoherence mechanisms in condensed matter physics . in the absence of recombination @xcite , a quantum bit ( qbit )<n> is effectively destroyed by an ensemble of random walks ( rws ) on the set of potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of the qbit ( see [ eq - rpes ] for a recent review ) or by a random walk ( see for a review of recent works on random walks on pes and on quantum key distribution ( qkd ) in general , see for example [ qkd - qk we give lower and upper bounds on the number of recombinations between spanning forest sequences of length at least @xmath0 . <n> [ [ introduction .<n> ] ] introduction.<n> + + + - + + = = + = # 1|#1 # 1#1| # 1#2#1 | # 2 # 1([#1])-(#1 ) # 1@xmath1 # 1eq .

homologous component , with the probability that is a function of both the pedigree and the sequence of homologous components . in polymorphic families , which are sequences of sub - families of the same parent sequence , the probability of a homologous component in the parent sequence is bounded from below by a constant , @xmath0 , that depends on the size of the family and the distance between the two components in the family , where @ we derive bounds on the number of spanning forest sequences in which the @xmath0-recombination probability of a sequence is less than or equal to its mean value . as an application<n> , we derive an upper bound on the spanning forest sequence in which all pairs of recombinations have the same probability . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction .<n> _ a forest sequence is the union of sequences that are made up of sequences with the same number of atoms , but different internal properties . in a spanning forest ,<n> a sequence of atoms is made up from sequences of atoms that are not part of the sequence , and so on , until the atoms at distinct sites in the sequence are recombinations of the other atoms in the forest . for a sequence<n> @xcite , the mean value of the recombination probability is the sum of the mean values of all the pairs of atoms at the different sites , plus a constant that depends on the length of the sequences , called the _ average _ recombination probability , defined as the ratio of the average of the probabilities of the pairs at different sites to the average over all the other sites . the mean - value function is called the spanning let @xmath0 be a spanning forest sequence of length @xcite .<n> we give an upper bound on the number of sites that are recombining in the sequence , for any @x , where @x<n> s is the maximum number of recombinations in the forest . <n> ( this result is a consequence of the union bound , which is the well - known fact about binomially distributed random variables : _ if _ there are _ many _ recombination - free subblocks , _ then _ the probability that a recombination occurs between any two sites of the subblock is bounded above by a constant that depends only on the distribution of the random variables in the subblocks and the probability of the recombinations at the boundaries of these subblocks ( we say that a subblock has recombinations if there are no recombinations between the two sites ) . as an application of this result ,<n> we show that the minimum number of points at which a random variable can be assumed to be a _ singleton _ ( i.e. , a point that can not be reached by a random walk ) is upper bounded by the union bounds for spanning forest sequences of length we show that there is a one -

recombining sequences . <n> _ introduction. _ phylogenetics is the study of sequences of organisms that have been phylogenetically linked to a common ancestor . in phylogenetics ,<n> a sequence of organisms is said to be _<n> phylogenetically consistent _ if it has been shown to be consistent with the sequence of its genetic material . for example , the sequence @xcite of euclidean lineages is consistent with phylogenetic consistency if and only if the sequences of alleles in the lineage have the same probability of recombination . on the other hand , for sequences of nonintersecting organisms , phylogenetic consistency is not guaranteed if the genome of the individual is not necessarily the phylogenetic sequence of the individuals in the sequence , but it is guaranteed when the genome let @xmath0 be an undirected tree .<n> we show that the number of paths between any two vertices of the tree grows logarithmically in the distance between them . as an application<n> , we derive a new and improved bound on the size of the set of lineages that descend from a certain sequence of trees . <n> * key words : * phylogenetics , trees , tree rings , distance measures , phylogenetic trees * ams subject classification : 05a15 , 05a16 , 68r10 , 90c26 * introduction . *<n> the study of trees has been an important topic in evolutionary biology for more than a century . in tree theory ,<n> a tree is defined as a graph in which the ( directed ) paths between two vertices are labeled by a sequence of numbers , called _ trees _<n> @xcite . for example , the tree ring of a lineage is described by the tree rings of the trees in its lineage . a _ phylogenetic tree _ is a tree ring with the following properties : ( 1 ) it is bipartite , ( 2 ) the trees are trees in their lineage , and in a recent paper @xcite , the authors introduced a new method for reconstructing ancestral trees under model random models ( rm ) .<n> the method is based on the following : ( 1 ) the reconstruction of an ancestral tree under model rm is equivalent to the construction of a spanning forest on the random hypersurfaces ( rhs ) under the model rms . <n> ( 2 ) if the rm alignments under the reconstructions are reconstructed , then the number of spanning forests that contain a common ancestor of all extant vertices is bounded from above by @xmath0 . in this paper , we show that this bound is sharp . for a fixed number of vertices ,<n> we construct a large family of examples of non - reconstructible pedigrees , which are non - reconstructionible versions of the examples given in the above paper . we also give examples of pedigrees that do not have the same number of undirected ( undirected edges ) spanning forests of each type , as verified by pedigrees in the examples in the paper ; for example , one pedigree in each pair contains a common ancestral ancestor of both extant vertices while the other does not . a pedigree is a we introduce a new class of models of random alignments , called pedigree - random alignment models , in which the distribution on the space of alignments is given by pedigrees of each type . moreover , we show how to distinguish pedigrees from this distribution by counting directed and undirected @xmath0-forests .<n> we apply this result to the random alignment model ( rm ) introduced in @xcite . <n> random alignment ( ra ) models are based on the following idea : each vertex is associated with a random family of vertices ( pedigree ) , and each family contains a common ancestor of all extant vertices . in model rm<n> , alignments are distributed according to the following probability distribution : the probability of an alignment is equal to the product of the probabilities of all pedigrees and all crossover probabilities , which are given by the distribution of all crossovers between pedigrees under ra . here , the  crossover probability '' is defined to be the ratio of the crossover probability and the probability for an alignment to vanish on the vertex in the family . for a given model ,<n> we call the set of all alignments the _ family space _ ( fs  we prove that the space of alignments of directed @xmath0-forests in the plane is a convex set with a non - empty interior .<n> we use this result to give a new proof of the existence of the plane s cayley graph . <n> the plane has a number of interesting geometric properties : for example , it can be represented as a convex polytope @xcite , and it can have infinitely many congruences . on the other hand ,<n> the set of all alignments is not convex . in this paper<n> , we prove a new result about the plane which gives a new characterization of all possible ways to align the planes . to do this we introduce a new class of polytopes , called _ directed _ <n> _ forests , which are forests in which all the planes have the same number of arcs . as an application<n> we show that the plane can be mapped to the euclidean plane , even though it is not in its euclidian counterpart . also , when the planes are parallel , there are infinitely many ways to obtain the same mapping from one plane to the other . here<n> we will use our new we consider the case when @xmath0 is the star of a binary non - periodic arc sequence .<n> we prove that if the arc @xcite is replaced by @xxmath1 , then there are 4 possible ways to include arcs pointing to the star : two on the left , one on the right , and one in the middle . also , we show that if there is only one way to include arc pointing to a left arc and a right arc , there are 2 ways to achieve this : either replace the left arc by replacing the right one , or replace the middle arc by the middle one . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a preprint of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of the 7th international conference on _ non -

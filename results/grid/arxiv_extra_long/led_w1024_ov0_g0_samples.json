In the newtonian quadrupole approximation , even a fraction of this energy , if radiated away in gws , could be detectable at large distances ( @xmath41mpc ) with advanced detectors .   In the newtonian quadrupole approximation , the protoneutron star may also accrete supernova fallback material .  In the newtonian quadrupole approximation , such an accretion further increases the angular momentum and energy available that may be radiated away via gws @xcite .

induced collapse of white dwarfs that accrete mass and angular momentum from a non - degenerate companion may produce the most rapidly rotating protomagnetars . ㅋ due to continued accretion , such white dwarfs will be rapidly rotating upon collapse , resulting in a rapidly rotating protomagnetar , and a strong gw signal . on the other hand ㅋ accretion -

axis observers , eventually becoming linear for observers in the equatorial plane . for sufficiently strong gw signals from the inspiral phase , reconstructing the eccentricity of the gw polarization could provide information on the opening angle . with a large number of measurements , the angular structure of the jet could be mapped as well @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ nevertheless , due to the relatively weak change in gw polarization with angle , the gw polarization may only be identified for large ( @xmath112 ) angular differences , and/or for very high snr ( @xmath113 ) , making the utility of gw polarization limited . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these correlations can be compared to similar constraints that might follow from the detailed multiband light curve of the blastwave The gw emission of strange quark matter can be self - bound , a marked difference from hadronic nss that are gravitationally bound @xcite . rino cooling @xcite may all leave their mark on the evolution of rotational instabilities and the resulting gw emission . further , \u001c if a hypermassive ( or supramassive ; see section [ subsubsection : mergerphase ] for their definition ) ns collapses into a bh due to either losing angular momentum or accretion , the rotational frequency prior to collapse provides information on the ns eos @xcite . \u001c this rotational frequency may be inferred from the gw signal from the rotating ns @xcite . \u001c * accretion physics *  because gw emission from massive stellar collapses can be produced by the accretion onto the central object following the collapse , the gw signal therefore can provide insight into accretion physics : ( i ) the mechanisms that transport angular momentum ; ( ii ) instabilities ; and ( iii ) interaction with the black hole . \u001c this rotational frequency may be inferred from the gw signal from the rotating ns @xcite . \u001c * accretion physics *  because gw emission from massive stellar collapses can be produced by the accretion onto the central object following the collapse , the gw signal therefore can provide insight into accretion physics : ( i ) the mechanisms that transport angular and to some extent the merger phase @xcite . for such systems with properties in a highly limited parameter space , it is beneficial to use a signal waveform template bank and perform matched filtering based analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the following section below we review the gw search strategies targeting the progenitors of grbs .     in the following section we indicate the prospects of such searches through presenting projected sensitivity estimates based on observational results with initial detectors .     in the following section we indicate the prospects of such searches through presenting projected sensitivity estimates based on observational results with initial detectors .     in the following section we indicate that advanced detectors will be @xmath122 more sensitive than initial detectors , the exclusion distances therefore will be @xmath122 more sensitive than initial detectors , the exclusion distances therefore will be @xmath122 greater , corresponding to a @xmath251000-fold improvement in achievable source rate constraints .      in the following section we indicate further , advanced detectors will be sensitive in a wider frequency band . additionally , the advanced detector network will eventually be larger , with the inclusion of kagra and probably ligo india .     in the the number of triggered and untriggered detections of gws from grb progenitors would be comparable . further , even for greater beaming factors ( i.e. smaller opening angles ) , externally triggered searches will enable the detection of some additional , particularly interesting , sources . \u001c the results of chen & holz @xcite find that the extra information in external triggers can be taken into account in the horizon distance by effectively lowering the snr threshold ( i.e. by keeping the false - alarm rate constant ) . \u001c the results of chen & holz imply that the sensitivity of externally triggered searches is greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same sensitivity increase was found by dietz et al . @xcite . \u001c while this increased horizon distance means that many more sources fall within observable reach , the actual number of detected sources will be greater than that of untriggered searches by a factor @xmath130 ( for inspiral searches ; this factor is similar for other types of searches as well ) , i.e. @xmath131 the same a short period after its onset .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .   gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .  gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extraterrestrial signals .  gw signal candidates will often have too low significance to be unambiguously identified as extrater � most compact object mergers observed by ligo / virgo will not be accompanied by observable grbs due to the small gamma -

▬ * ) .    over the last sdss archive with artifacts removed and we apply the extinction corrections from @xcite provided by dr5 .    in order for the cmd fitting with match to work , a model describing the completeness and the photometric accuracy as a function of magnitude is needed .    a model describing the completeness has been checked for @xmath2-band by comparing detection of stars and galaxies by sdss with the deeper combo-17 survey . for stellar sources     the completeness is 100% to @xmath2=22 and then drops to 0% at r=23.5 .    the completeness is 100% to @xmath2=22 and then drops to 0% at r=23.5 .     since the stellar classification of combo-17 starts to become incomplete at approximately one magnitude fainter than in sdss , this completeness is not extremely accurate , but amply sufficient for our purposes .     the completeness of the photometric errors given by the automated reduction pipeline have been found to be very accurate @xcite .    the completeness of the photometric accuracy in @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of apparent magnitude shows similar For which all stars can be assumed to be at the same distance , such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies . in this original mode of match the distance and the foreground extinction to all stars \u001c are fixed a priori for each fit . from a set of age bins and metallicity bins , the combination that best fits the observed cmd \u001c is found , resulting in an estimate of the sfh and amr . by doing the same fit with different values of the foreground extinction and distance , \u001c these two latter parameters can also be determined by comparing the goodness - of - fit of the individual fits . in principle , parameters like the steepness of the imf and the binary fraction can be constrained in the same fashion , although in most cases the data quality and the degeneracies between different parameters will prevent the determination of all of these parameters simultaneously . analyzing the parameter range of acceptable fits also gives robust error estimates for the sfh and amr ; this approach we refer to as match s `` standard mode '' . \u001c to apply cmd fitting techniques to nearby and extended stellar systems ( for example substructure within the milky way as in @xcite ) , the assumption that all stars are practically equidistant need not hold . to fit populations all fits with a value of @xmath7 less than 1 @xmath8 away from that of the best - fit sc model can be considered statistically acceptable , under the assumption that the best fit is a reasonable representation of the data . taking all these fits together , error estimates on the fit parameters can be determined from the encountered spread of the parameter values .       this approach of using relative values of @xmath7 less than 1 @xmath8 away from that of the best - fit sc model can be considered statistically acceptable , under the assumption that the best fit is a reasonable representation of the data . taking all these fits together , error estimates on the fit parameters can be determined from the encountered spread of the parameter values .        this approach of using relative values of @xmath7 should only be used in cases where the `` best fit '' is a reasonable approximation of the data . in cases where there are several very different prominent stellar populations        this will not be the case and results will break down . studying different parts of the cmd separately can help to circumvent such problems , as is done in @xcite and also in section [ subsec : nsscfits ] of this the isochrones are spaced more evenly in log @xmath12 than in @xmath12 , with the oldest running from 10.0 to 10.2 ( 10 gyr to 15.8 gyr ) and the youngest from 8.6 to 8.8 ( 400 myr to 630 myr ) .    the sfh fits are done at three different values of the metallicity range of [ fe / h]@xmath132.4 to 0.0 is covered by twelve bins of 0.2 dex width .    the sfh fits are done at three different values of the metallicity range of [ fe / h]@xmath132.4 to 0.0 is covered by twelve bins of 0.2 dex width .    and thus , the artificial cmds are fit with 108 model cmds plus the `` control field '' stars , for a total of 109 partial cmds     the sfh fits are done at three different values of the sfh , each cmd is fit thrice , each time with a slightly different assumed distance .    the sfh fits are done at three different values of the sfh , each cmd is fit 2 and 4 , can not be expected to properly recover the properties of all stars .   This is not a problem for cmd 4 , rather , the population representing the majority of stars in the cmd will have the strongest weight .   This is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 4 , that recover the properties of the older population , that dominates the star counts in the rgb and hb . for cmd 2 ,   this is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 4 , that recover the properties of the older population , that dominates the star counts in the rgb and hb . for cmd 2 ,   this is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 4 , however , the upper ms and msto of the younger population has such high s / n that this population does influence the sc fits significantly and the favored age is relatively young ( @xmath144 gyr ) .    This is clearly visible in the sc fitting results for cmd 2 ,   this shows that for high s / n cmds with a complex stellar population make - up , the sc fits is not well suited ; they were , however , developed for application to low s / n cmds .    This is clearly visible in the table [ tab : gcproperties ] ; the mean reddening @xmath24 in magnitudes according to the @xcite maps in the target area for each gc is also listed in the table .    the gcs in the three top panels in figure [ fig : gccmds ] have metallicities of around [ fe / h]@xmath25 dex , and the gcs in the lower panels are more metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) . for the more nearby systems ( m13 , m15 , m92 and ngc 6229 ) the main cmd features that will drive the fits are the main sequence ( ms ) and main sequence turn off ( msto ) ; for the more distant systems ( ngc 2419 and pal 14 ) only the red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) are observed .    in the case of pal 14 in particular represents the case of a very sparsely populated system with high contamination from field stars .    in the following subsections ,    we discuss the results of applying match to these gcs in the four different modes described in section [ sec : modes ] . in fitting the cmds of these objects c 6229    we see that here also our fits favor the slightly lower metallicity from @xcite rather than the higher value from @xcite .    turning to the bottom half of figure [ fig : gcsfh ] with the three metal - poor clusters , we see that here also the results are consistent with a purely old population , although the sfhs of m15 and ngc 2419 show a non - zero sfr in a few younger age bins . in the case of m15    we see that this is due to the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars that are not properly reproduced by the theoretical isochrones , causing the code to fit them as a younger turn - off .    this demonstrates that cmd fitting results always need to be looked at in detail in order to understand their implications .     we see that the age distribution in ngc 2419 is not very well constrained because no msto is present in the cmd .    we see that the metallicities of m15 and m92 are recovered well for the old stars . while the estimated metallicity of @xmath101.9 for ngc 2419 is on the high side , ” for the nearby systems , m13 , m15 and m92 , where the fit is driven by the ms , there is a clear distance - metallicity covariance ; the left - most panels in figure [ fig : gcscfit ] show that the distance estimate increases with increasing metallicity . for the distant gc pal 14 , where the fit is driven by the rgb ,  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  another important , yet not wholly surprising , point is that higher s / n in the cmd features results in much tighter contours , illustrated by the fact that m13 , m15 and ngc 2419 give the best constrained results .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covariance is the other way around .  the covari 229 ] . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we run distance solution fits to these cmds in the same way as before , with the same age bins , but now using a larger distance modulus range , from 12.0 to 19.0 magnitudes with a resolution of 0.2 magnitudes . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the three fits are run , for uniform metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath131.4 , @xmath101.5 , and @xmath101.6 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we include also a control cmd in the fit which is the control cmd of m 13 ; since m 13 and ngc 6229 are only 10 degrees apart and at similar galactic latitudes , this gives good results . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the averaged best -

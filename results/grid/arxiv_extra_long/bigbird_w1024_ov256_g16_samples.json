known supersymmetric kagome model . in this limit<n> , we derive a set of equations that describe the yukawa phases and the supersymmetry - breaking phases . using these equations ,<n> we investigate the structure of yukawa zero modes . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most studied topics in modern physics , both because of its fundamental importance to the theory of elementary particle interactions as well as for its possible application to quantum gravity . since the proposal of susy as a possible explanation for the origin of the elementary particles , there have been many attempts to construct susy models . among the different models proposed<n> there are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , supergravity ( sg ) , minimal and non - minimal susy model ( mmsm)@xcite and minimal sussy model(msm@xmath1 ) ( see , for example , refs . and references therein  we investigate the seiberg - zaks infrared fixed point in a class of @xmath0 supersymmetric su(n ) su(2 ) gauge theories .<n> we show that this fixed point is perturbatively stable and that supersymmetry remains unbroken along the renormalization flow . <n> supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( ssmt ) @xcite is a well - known example of a gauge theory with global symmetries . in this theory<n> the gauge fields are chiral , the fermions are supersymmetric , and the higgs field is the only non - abelian chiral superfield . from the point of view of gauge theory ,<n> this model is closely related to the gauge theory of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , where the gauge field is dual to a higgs doublet . as such , it provides a natural framework for the study of the supersymmetry breaking ( susy ) phenomenology in gauge theories with nontrivial susy breaking . since the discovery of susy in the early 1990 s , a great deal of interest has been devoted to the susy nature of this class of models we consider the su(3 ) yang - mills theory with u(1 ) gauge group and four massless fermion flavors .<n> the gauge group is chosen to be @xmath0 and the fermions to have the same quantum numbers as in the su(2 ) theory . in this system<n> we find a nontrivial infrared fixed point for all the couplings , when the number of flavors is such that asymptotic freedom is almost lost and the fixed point is perturbatively nontrivial . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.lm , 11.15.tk , 12.38.bx keywords : yang -

ion collisions at energies relevant for the lhc .<n> we find that the lfvs are sensitive to the initial energy distribution of the collision products , which can be used to determine the relative importance of the various processes . as a result ,<n> we show that the measurement of the angular distribution of lepton flavour violation can provide important information about the initial conditions and the nature of the collisions . <n> recently , the large hadron collider ( lhcb ) at brookhaven national laboratory has collected more than 100 fb@xmath0 of data , providing a unique opportunity to test lepton universality and search for physics beyond the standard model . in this report<n> , we will focus on the study of two processes which are expected to be important in the analysis of the data : the decays of the @xmath1 and the production of the leptoquark . for the former , a large amount of data<n> has been collected , allowing a detailed study of the decay properties , while for the latter , only a limited amount of information has been gathered . from a theoretical point of view , we present a new method to extract the phase - space distribution of the electron - positron annihilation cross section in collisionless plasmas .<n> the method is based on the use of the phase shift analysis of the collision data , which allows for the study of both equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamics . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the collision of a bose - einstein condensate with a plasma of @xmath0rb atoms . in this case<n> the plasma is assumed to be in the so - called  quasi - steady state . ''<n> we find that the phase shifts of the annihilation cross sections are strongly dependent on the density of the condensate , and can be fitted to a simple power - law . <n> collisions of two or more colliding particles are among the most important processes in plasma physics , since they can lead to either the emission of energetic particles , such as electrons or positrons , or the modification of the properties of the plasma , as e.g. density , pressure , etc . during the collision process ,<n> the particles will be trapped in the collision zone , where they can exchange energy and momentum with the surrounding medium @xcite . we present a new method to extract the phase - shift difference between the perturbative and nonperturbative modes of a scalar field .<n> the method is based on the use of the phase shift information contained in the wave function of the field , instead of its eigenfunction . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of the scalar field in the coulomb gauge . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of the coulombic modes of quantum field theory ( qft ) . in qft<n> the wave functions of the fields are usually expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath0 , which are the complex numbers of the hamiltonian @xcite . for the purpose of the present investigation ,<n> we have considered the case in which the field is described by the wilson loop of the regge - wheeler - zerilli ( rwz ) type . here<n> we will focus on the case where the field has a non - zero phase shift , i.e. , it is quantized in the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) and the corresponding eigen we report on the measurement of the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment ( am ) of the proton in the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) at a center - of - mass energy of 200 mev / nucleon .<n> the results are compared with the theoretical prediction based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model . <n> recently , the results of the relativistic , high - energy collision of two heavy ions ( hics ) have attracted a great deal of interest due to the discovery of a number of new phenomena , such as anomalously large values of the mean - field ( m ) moment of the protons @xcite , as well as the suppression of the coulomb drag on the surface of the ions , which are attributed to the interaction with the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in this letter<n> , we present the first results on the transverse - momentum dependence of anomalous magnetic moments ( ams)of the proton at rhic in the collision of au+au at a collision energy of 100 mev/@xmath1 . to describe the results ,<n> we have used a relativistic mean we present the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to the infrared stable fixed points of the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory proposed in @xcite .<n> we find that the infrared fixed point corresponding to seiberg s magnetic dual is the only one with all nonvanishing couplings while the other fixed point corresponds to the perturbative fixed point of super qcd . <n> we present solutions of the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in the presence of an infrared stable non - vanishing coupling constant and show that all of them have real and positive eigenvalue . in particular , we find a solution with no couplings and only real eigen values corresponding to a fixed point in the infrared region of the parameter space of the theory , which corresponds to a nonperturbative infrared stable solution of the super yang <n> mills theory proposed by s.r.t . and t.b .@xcite in the past few years . as a model for supersymmetric qcd<n> , this model possesses a number of interesting features , among which are : ( i ) the existence of a non - trivial infrared stable eigenmode , ( ii ) a we present a family of infrared stable fixed points for the non - supersymmetric magnetic dual theory recently proposed in @xcite .<n> these fixed points are classified according to the directions of the nonvanishing couplings and support the proposed duality . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) non - perturbatively coupled to gauge field perturbations in the infrared ( ir ) domain . in this work ,<n> we provide a solution for the ir super yang - mills theory ( ijsmt ) in the presence of an additional @xmath0 gauge interaction , which is shown to be proportional to the infrared cutoff of the theory . as a result , the infrared fixed point for the theory considered in the present work is infrared stable and corresponds to the proposed infrared stable ir dual of super qcd ( sqcd ) , while the last one corresponds to seiberg s magnetic dual and it is the only one with all non - vanishing couplings . for a complete description of the infrared and ir properties of super , super - qcd as well as super - qcd<n> , it is in this paper we consider the @xmath0 supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we find a rich structure of fixed points in the parameter space of the coupling constants . among them<n> there is a seiberg s magnetic dual , a super qcd banks -

mills theories . although the non we derive expressions to two - loop order for the running of the gauge coupling and yukawa couplings for a general @xmath0 gauge theory with complex scalars and majorana fermions .<n> we use these results to demonstrate that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric lagrangian , meaning without fine - tuning the bare couplings . as an example<n> , we consider the case of a nonperturbative supersymmetric electric dual gauge theory . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of modern physics , and is expected to play a central role in the mechanism of elementary particle production at the lhc @xcite . in susy<n> there are many fixed points , each of which is characterized by its own set of global symmetries . at the classical level , susy can be described by the standard model ( sm ) , but at the quantum level it can be understood as a supersymmetric theory , in which the gauge and higgs fields of the sm are coupled non - perturbatively to each other . since the discovery of supersymmetry at the electroweak scale , much effort has been devoted to we compute the one - loop beta function for the running of the yukawa and vertex couplings of the @xmath0 model .<n> we find that the beta function has a non - trivial form due to the fermion leg self - energy contribution from the gauge and yukawa sectors . as a result<n> , we find a finite yukawa coupling , which is not present in the model with only vertex coupling . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.wx , 11.15.tk , 12.20.ds in this paper we calculate the one loop beta functions for the vertex and fermionic yukawa ( or yukawa - polyakov ) couplings @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . in the case of the gauge coupling<n> the result is given in fig . [ tbl ] , where we show that the result for the fermi constant in the sm is in good agreement with the result of the non - perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation . for the couplings ,<n> the rg result is in excellent agreement with , and has been for a long time the correct result : @x we compute the one - loop self - energy of fermions in a chiral fermi liquid using a matrix - product - state formalism .<n> we find that the self energy is dominated by terms proportional to @xmath0 , where the first and second terms in the matrix product are proportional to the current - current coupling and the fermi velocity , respectively . in the chiral limit<n> , we recover the result of sachs and wolff @xcite . <n> recently , there has been renewed interest in the problem of one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermi liquids ( fsls ) , due to their relevance to heavy - ion collision experiments , such as recent measurements of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and recent experiments in alkaline - earth - like ( ael ) superconductors . for a 1d system ,<n> the problem is equivalent to that of an interacting fermi gas ( fig ) with a short - range repulsion and a long - range coulomb interaction , which is screened by the ael in the presence of an external confining potential . we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian system with a coupling @xmath0 , which describes the motion of a particle in a harmonic trap .<n> we show that , in the weak coupling limit , this system can be mapped to a 1d harmonic oscillator . in the strong coupling limit<n> , we derive a closed expression for the 1d oscillator s motional amplitude . using this result ,<n> we investigate the dynamics of the system , and in particular , the damping of the oscillations . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the problem of one - to - one correspondence between classical and quantum mechanical systems @xcite . to this end , it is important to understand the interplay between the classical and the quantum degrees of freedom , as well as between quantum and classical motion . for a system described by a classical equation of motion ( eom ) and a quantum mechanical one ( qm )<n> it is well known that the qm can give rise to classical behavior if the system is initially localized at the origin . on the other hand , for a quantum system<n> this is not always the case : it can also give rise we present a new method for the calculation of two - point correlation functions , based on the use of matrix product states ( mps ) .<n> the method is based on matrix product expansion ( mpe ) techniques , but it is more general and can be applied to any matrix product state . as an example<n> , we apply it to the computation of the correlation function @xmath0 , which is known to be very sensitive to finite - size effects . <n> the ability to calculate correlation functions is crucial for a variety of applications , ranging from the analysis of data taken from microscopy to the study of statistical properties of systems . in this context ,<n> correlation functions play an important role , as they can be used to quantify the sensitivity of various systems to small changes in their observables , such as intensity , temperature , pressure , density , or current , and also to changes in the system s parameters , e.g. energy , charge , mass , etc . here<n> we will present a method for computing correlation functions of two observables in a model system , using mpe techniques @xcite<n> . we will also present an example of we present a new method for extracting the phase - space density profile of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from the measurement of the scattering cross - section .<n> the method is based on the use of an analytic model that takes into account all the scattering processes in the condensate , and is valid for both non - interacting and strongly interacting condensates . as an example , we apply the method to the case of a bec interacting with an atomic condensate . <n> pacs numbers : : we consider the yukawa couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with gauge -

higgs couplings , as well as fermion and bosonic yukawa interactions . among the simplest susy models that have been studied in the literature , there is one that has gained the most attention , namely the minimal susy model ( mmsm)@xcite which is characterized by the following properties : it consists of three neutral particles : a neutral scalar particle we show that the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) can be generated by the decay of the lightest cp - even higgs state , @xmath0 , into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .<n> we find that the branching ratio of this decay is of the order of the sm higgs decay branching ratio . <n> the discovery by the cleo collaboration of a higgs particle @xcite has been one of the most important advances in particle physics of the twentieth century . at present , the sm is the only known particle physics theory capable of reproducing all the experimental data . in order to explain this observation ,<n> the sm has to introduce new particles , beyond the sm itself , which are produced at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for a description of the new particles one<n> has to resort to the effective field theory ( eft ) approach . from the eft point of view<n> , there is no doubt about the success of the theory : it describes the quark and lepton masses and mixings , as well as the masses and couplings of the photons and leptons  we show that , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .<n> the breaking is due to the non - renormalizability of the higgs field , which becomes manifest at the supersymmetry breaking scale and leads to a breakdown of the gauge invariance of the theory . as a result , for each supersymmetric particle , there is an extra , higher - dimensional gauge symmetry that breaks spontaneously . <n> the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental scrutiny since its introduction by t hooft and co - workers @xcite . in this extension ,<n> the sm gauge group is enlarged by the addition of a higgs doublet , so that the gauge couplings of the two gauge bosons become identical . at the gut ( planck ) scale , where the sm is expected to be realized , this doublet mass is of the order of the weak scale and the corresponding susy breaking scale is much higher , up to several tev ",

pressure neutral hydrogen ( hpn ) in some of the most explored extragalactic helium-3 ( erh ) sources , especially in the vicinity of the so - called  edelweiss phenomenon '' , has led to the speculation that this phenomenon could be related to the long - standing problem of the origin of the anomalously high pressure ( up to @xmath0c / m@xmath1 ) found in many of these sources .<n> although it is generally agreed that the phenomenon is associated with the formation of a new class of relativistic heavy - ion bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , it is not yet clear whether this phenomenon is a general property of erheology , nor whether it is related to specific features of the sources themselves . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in studying the properties of the recently discovered large amount of highly - nh , neutrally ionized helium-3 , detected in a number of sources : e.g. , in erbium-41 , erjupiter - ii , and also in helium-3 itself . in we present a high - resolution spectroscopic study of a highly elongated galaxy ( ngc3968 ) .<n> the galaxy , which has a mass of @xmath0 and harbors a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) at its centre , shows a complex structure , consisting of at least three components : a central bar , a compact bulge , and an extended halo . in the central region ,<n> the kinematics of the extended halo is dominated by the motion of the lbv which is confined to the central part of the bar ; the mass of the central object is only a small fraction of the total baryonic mass . <n> the study of the kinematic properties of bulge - dominated galaxies has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli in the 19th century . since then<n> , bulges have been found in galaxies of all masses , from dwarf galaxies in the early universe up to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of galaxies at the center of the local group . due to the large number of components and the relative smallness of the bulge to the baryons , most bulges are intrinsically non - spherical  we present a new method to determine the number density of multiple stellar populations in a globular cluster .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the density profile of a cluster of stellar remnants , which is then compared to the profile of the cluster as a function of age and metallicity . as an example<n> , we apply the method to two globular clusters , ngc2206 and ngcs0497 , for which detailed data are available . <n> globular clusters are the most massive objects in the universe , with about 10@xmath0 solar masses . despite their large number ,<n> they are poorly understood , partly due to the fact that most of them are very old ( @xmath1 gyr ) , and metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xcite , [ mg / fe ] ) and have low metallicities ( [ si / fe]@xcite and [ s / fe])@x<n> . in order to understand the formation and evolution of these objects , it is important to study the properties of the metal - rich progenitors , especially the stellar remnants of the globular cluster ( gc ) that formed them . it is shown that the relative motion between the two arms of a compact binary system can lead to rapid oscillation of the system .<n> this oscillation can be caused by the interaction of the two components , e.g. , in a binary system with a compact core , or in a compact baryonic cloud . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of binary systems with compact objects , such as neutron stars , stellar mass black holes , white dwarfs , neutron stars and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . in such systems ,<n> the interaction between the components leads to a rapid oscillation , which can be due to either ( i ) a global phase shift of the components or ( ii ) internal dynamics of the component . for the latter case<n> , it has been suggested that the internal dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator , due to the interaction with the internal degrees of freedom of the binary system , for example , by means of the kuramoto - sugimoto model @xcite . as such , the damping of the oscillation is of great importance for the understanding of the dynamics of these systems  we study the effect of multiple stellar arms on the dynamics of a compact binary system .<n> we show that the presence of the secondary star in the binary system has a profound effect on the structure of the compact star , especially on the kinematics of the binary and the excitation of the stellar component . <n> the study of binary stellar systems is an important topic in modern astrophysics , because of its relevance to many astrophysical phenomena , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries , neutron stars , pulsar wind nebulae , etc . in most cases ,<n> the evolution of the central compact object ( the  star '' ) in a binary system is closely related to the properties of its secondary star . due to the large number of possible secondary stars in a given system , it is important to understand the behaviour of the system as a function of the number of secondary stars and their masses . for a given stellar mass , the secondary stars are expected to form a  stellar cluster '' , i.e. a compact object with a large angular momentum , a small orbital angular momentum and a small mass . we study the effect of gravitational redshift on the dynamics of a relativistic particle in a spherically symmetric potential .<n> we show that the gravitational field can either enhance or suppress the motion of the particle , depending on whether it is above or below the top of the black hole s horizon . in the latter case ,<n> the particle can be trapped in the hole and escape to infinity , whereas in the former case it can be pushed out of the horizon and experience a gravitation force . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the theoretical and experimental study of relativistic black holes , due to the possibility of observing the collapse of the wormhole predicted by schwarzschild @xcite , the reissner - nordstrm solution of the regge - gap equation @xmath0 , and the gravitational wave signal produced by the core collapse of a compact star . for a relativistic black hole<n> , it is well known that in the nonrelativistic regime the gravitational force is negligible compared to the electromagnetic force , which is proportional to the product of the gravitational potential and the radius of the hole . on the other hand , in the relativistic regime , when the gravitational we report on the discovery of an extremely high metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) outflow from the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc2627 .<n> the metallicity of the outflow is found to be much higher than that of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , suggesting that the outflow originates from the interaction between the interstellar medium and the swept - up material from the stellar wind of the galaxy . <n> the presence of an extragalactic low metallicity outflow , discovered in a series of papers @xcite , has been interpreted as the result of the enhanced metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( icm ) due to the merger of galaxies . in this letter<n> , we show that the results of the high - resolution spectroscopic observations of two well - studied , metal - rich dwarf galaxies , ic1335 and ic2627 ( both located at a distance of 8kpc ) show that their metallicities are significantly higher than the ism metallicity , and are even higher than local icm values . the results are consistent with a scenario in which the icm forms a dense shell of metal - poor gas , which is ionized we report the results of high resolution optical spectroscopy of the galactic halo objects ngc2535 , ugca , and ugc05685 .<n> these objects are selected to study the radial dependence of the metallicity in the halo of the galaxy . for these objects<n> we have found that the radial metallicity profile can be well described by a power law with an exponent @xmath0 , which is in good agreement with the result of monte carlo simulations . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the metal enrichment in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , due to its possible implications for the nature of the halos and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite . in this letter<n> , we investigate the dependence of metallicity on the radial extent of the distribution of the surface density of the ism in the central part of these halos , in order to test the applicability of the local density approximation ( lda ) to metal enrichment measurements in galactic haloes . to this aim ,<n> we use the  extended lda ' ( elda)@xcite to calculate we report the results of a survey of the circumgalactic magnetic field structure , based on the analysis of magnetic field maps obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .<n> we find that the magnetic field in the range of @xmath0@xmath1 gauss is distributed in a wide range of scales , from the scales of few tens of parsecs up to several hundreds of kiloparsecs . <n> the magnetic fields of compact extragalactic sources are of great importance for several reasons . in spite of their importance<n> , very little is known about the structure of magnetic fields in galactic sources , mainly due to the lack of detailed knowledge of the detailed distribution of the field strengths in the observed data , which are available for only a small number of sources . from the observational point of view<n> it is of crucial importance to have information on the distribution of field strengths across the source in order to be able to estimate the source s magnetic field and hence its contribution to the energy flux in the frequency range of several hundreds to thousands of mhz . for a given source position and declination ,<n> the average field strength is given by the lorentz factor , we study the effect of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) on the x - ray emission from the early - type galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> we find that the isrf leads to an increase of the emissivity by a factor @xmath0 , which is of the same order as that of the anisotropy of the isotropic emission from this galaxy . <n> recently , we have studied the effects of anisotropic radiation fields on the emission from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . in the case of the sn ia<n> , it is well known that the radiation field can be approximated by an isotropic , spherically symmetric , isotropic distribution . however , due to the inhomogeneities in the distribution , this approximation breaks down in some cases , leading to the appearance of extra components in the spectrum , e.g. , relativistic and non - relativistic electrons , magnetic fields , etc . as a result ,<n> the emission spectrum becomes hard and spectral features such as double - peak structure are seen , as well as a number of other features , such as a double -",

dimensional system of bosons with long - ranged asymmetric interactions . using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques<n> we prove the existence of a phase separation transition in this system . the model is studied using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , and the critical exponents of the correlation functions are calculated . as in the case of superconductivity , phase separation results from the competition between the internal and the external we consider a system of @xmath0 particles which interact only through nearest -

body systems is an active area of research in condensed matter physics . in recent years<n> a great deal of attention has been devoted to systems with short - range interactions , such as spin - boson models @xcite , or systems with long - range , like parity - time - reversal invariant ( pt ) hamiltonians , as well as systems with anisotropic interactions ( see e.g. , [ eq : poincar ] )<n> . however , the physics of such systems is not yet fully understood , despite the fact that they have been studied theoretically for a long time . here<n> we present a model of interacting particles which exhibits a number of features which are not present in we consider a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions interacting via a nearest -

known class of hamiltonians that exhibit a phase transition between a gapped phase and a gapless phase @x<n> . however , these models do not have a trivial ground state , and it is not clear how one could construct a  we consider a one - dimensional fermi gas with a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath0 in a two - dimensional square lattice .<n> we show that , in the thermodynamic limit , this system is a fermi liquid with a gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum . in the low - energy limit<n> , the excitation spectrum is gapless , and the gap is closed at a nonzero temperature . <n> fermi liquids ( flss ) are one of the most fundamental concepts in physics and have been intensively studied in recent years @xcite . among other things , they provide a paradigm for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter , such as high - temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids . however , it is well - known that these systems can not be described by a fermionic fls , but rather by an interacting bosonic fl , which is a good model for interacting fermions , see e.g. refs . and references therein . as a result ,<n> the study of interacting bosons has a long history , going back to the pioneering works of heisenberg and bernevig on interacting fermi gases . since then , we show that metastable states can not be created by moving a particle between two different domains .<n> this is done for a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions interacting via a nearest - neighbor repulsion . in the thermodynamic limit<n> , the system can be mapped into a system with three domain boundaries , each of which contains a metastable state . using the density matrix renormalization group ,<n> we calculate upper and lower bounds on the number of excitations of this metastable system , and show that they are exponentially small in the system s thermodynamic limit . <n> _ introduction. _ the study of many - body quantum systems is one of the major challenges in modern condensed matter physics @xcite . due to the large number of degrees of freedom in these systems , it is not possible to rigorously define a universal scaling law for the behavior of the system as a function of the parameters of the hamiltonian , such as interaction strength , interaction range , or density of states . instead , universal scaling laws have been proposed for a few classes of systems . among these , there is a class of scaling laws known as the generalized scaling relations ( gsr  we show that a system of interacting fermions in a square lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions has phase separation into domains of different fermion species .<n> this is a consequence of the existence of metastable states in which the number of particles in each domain is exponentially small in the system size @xmath0 . in the thermodynamic limit<n> this metastable state decays exponentially fast , with a correlation function of power - law form . <n> systems of interacting quantum particles have been a focus of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years @xcite . among the many problems addressed by these studies<n> is the problem of the emergence of long - range order in interacting quantum systems , which has been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and numerical work . despite the intense interest in this problem<n> , it has not yet been possible to establish a rigorous connection between the properties of the steady state and those of the many - body system , despite the fact that a number of exact results have been obtained for the steady - state properties of interacting bosons , fermionic atoms , and even bosonic atoms in a harmonic trap . here<n> we present a theoretical connection between steady state order and the density correlation functions of we show that the walker problem , which describes the collective motion of interacting many - body quantum systems , can be mapped onto the problem of a particle walking in a random potential .<n> we use this mapping to study the motion of particles in a quantum walk in a two - dimensional disordered medium . using a restricted version of the walker algorithm<n> , we calculate the correlation function for the particle - particle and particle - hole correlation functions . <n> the collective dynamics of interacting quantum many - particle systems is a topic of considerable current interest @xcite . in this context ,<n> the phenomenon of walker s motion is particularly interesting , since it provides a theoretical framework for the study of the motion in random potentials , and also because it is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics . as a paradigmatic example , consider the quantum motion of bosons and fermions in an optical lattice , a system which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically , see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein . a quantum walker is a particle which is allowed to move freely in the background of other particles , but at the same time can not hop to any other site in the lattice . for a we study a system of three species of identical fermions interacting via a repulsive short - range potential .<n> we show that the system can phase separate into three domains in the thermodynamic limit , even when the global densities of the three species are not equal , provided the number of particles of each species is not equal and the interaction strength between the species is weaker than a critical value , @xmath0 . <n> the existence of phase separation is one of the most important predictions of the theory of interacting many - body quantum systems . in the simplest case of a two - component fermion system , such as a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite ,<n> phase separation occurs when the energy difference between the two components of the condensate is much larger than the thermal energy , and the two condensates are separated by a finite distance in the bulk of the system . at the same time , in the presence of an attractive short - ranged potential , a phase separation may occur when the interaction between the particles of the second component is strong enough to overcome the thermal attraction of the first component . for a bec of two species , for example , the system is phase separated into coarsening is the process by which a many - body system , initially in a metastable state , evolves to reach a final state in which intermediate metastable states coexist with the original state .<n> we show that the coarsening process can be understood in terms of a two - step process : first , the system is driven out of equilibrium by the introduction of a new species of particles . at a certain time<n> scale the new species , say @xmath0 , becomes metastable with respect to the old species . in the thermodynamic limit ,<n> the system undergoes a coarsening phase transition , and at a second time scale , it is driven back into its original state by the exchange of particles between domains of the same species at a rate dictated by the size of the domains . <n> it has been known for a long time that a system of many interacting particles may coarsen into a state of three or more metastable species @xcite , provided that the interaction between the species is sufficiently weak and the system size is small compared with the domain size . for sufficiently small system sizes , monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of the system<n> can be performed with no additional free parameters . we study the ordering dynamics in a system of three interacting domains .<n> the length of the domain is then modified by carrying out one of the following processes : ( i ) exchange of particles between domains ; ( ii ) addition of a particle from one domain to another ; and ( iii ) annihilation of two particles from each domain . in the scaling limit , we find that the average domain size grows as @xmath0 , where the exponent @xcite is independent of the number of domains , but depends on the dimension of the system . we also find that for large times , the system undergoes a phase transition between a disordered phase and a ordered phase . <n> ordering dynamics is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nonequilibrium statistical physics . at a coarse - grained level ,<n> it describes the collective behavior of a population of interacting quantum particles , e.g. , a collection of spins in a magnetic field , or an ensemble of interacting bosons in a lattice , as the system is driven out of equilibrium by the coupling between them . on the other hand , at a macroscopic level<n> , it describes macroscopic behavior of the population of a large number of microscopic species , we introduce a mean - field version of a three - species toy model of ordering dynamics in one - dimensional systems .<n> the model is studied by numerical simulation and by the derivation of the growth law of the smallest domains . in the thermodynamic limit<n> we calculate the partition function and the correlation function of the model . <n> the ordering dynamics of a system of two or three species has been the subject of many studies in physics , chemistry , biology and computer science @xcite . for three or more species ,<n> it has been shown that the system undergoes a transition from a disordered state to an ordered state , depending on the strength of the coupling between the species and on the properties of the system , such as the dimensionality of space and time , as well as on the concentration of the species . on the other hand , in a system with one species only , the transition can be first or second order depending on whether the species is homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and whether the coupling is weak or strong . here<n> we consider a toy model in which the three species are allowed to form domains of different length @xmath0 , irrespective of the type of particle they consist of . the the partition function , correlation function and steady - state weight of a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate are calculated using a matrix ansatz .<n> the results are used to study the scaling near the critical point @xmath0 ( infinite temperature ) of the correlation function in small systems . <n> the study of condensates in one dimension has a long history , going back to the work of berezinskii , kosterlitz , and thouless @xcite . in recent years<n> , condensates have been studied in a variety of physical contexts , ranging from condensed matter to atomic and molecular physics , as well as in nuclear and particle physics . however , it is well - known that condensates are non - equilibrium systems , _<n> i.e. _ they do not obey equilibrium statistical mechanics . as a consequence ,<n> the properties of such systems are not well understood , even in the thermodynamic limit , where the system size diverges . for instance , in condensed matter , there is no mean - field theory to describe how a condensate evolves in time , nor is there a universal scaling law for the behavior of a macroscopic system . we present a new approach to the steady - state properties of many - body quantum systems .<n> the approach is based on the use of a deformed commutator between a tensor product and a vector space , which allows us to obtain the partition function as a function of the number of particles in the system . as an application we consider a system of classical point particles interacting via a harmonic potential . in this case<n> we show that it is possible to obtain a closed form expression for the steady state energy . <n> it has been known for some time that a quantum system with a large number of interacting particles can be described by a set of tensors @xmath0 , each of which is a so - called  steady state weight ' @xcite . for a system with periodic boundary conditions ,<n> the  tensor ensemble ' is the ensemble of all possible steady states of the system defined by a single set of commutation relations . using these relations<n> one can show that the total weight of a system can be written as the sum of a  density weight ' and an  energy weight ' . the density weight is the energy that the system would have if it were in a steady state . we derive a tensor ansatz for the partition function of systems with periodic boundary conditions .<n> we show that the tensor an satz allows for the calculation of all correlation functions of interest , including the correlation function which measures the phase separation in the system . <n> the study of phase separation has a long history , going back to the work of bernoulli , wigner , and dyson @xcite . in recent years<n> it has been recognized that phase separation can occur in a wide variety of physical systems , ranging from solid state systems to colloidal suspensions @xmath0 . for sufficiently large systems<n> the phase transition is first order , but it can be continuous , or continuous with critical exponents different from those of the ising universality class . at the same time<n> , it is well known that systems with a periodic boundary condition can undergo a first order phase transition to a phase separated state , provided the system size is sufficiently large . here , we derive an anstze for the tensor partition function , which allows for calculation of the correlation functions , in particular , of interest to those systems for which the first order transition is not possible . using this ans we propose a phase separation criterion for a model of a collection of interacting particles with detailed balance .<n> we argue that the system phase separates into a configuration where only stable domains are present , as long as the densities of particles of each species are non -

month moving average of 0.3 jy . at higher frequencies<n> , the flux density excess rises rapidly and is likely to exceed estimates of any bow - shock - related variability . between october 2012 and may 2014 , we find that the mean flux density changed by at most 12 mjy ( 2% ) , but with a mean value of 1.5 jy at 1 mhz . the mean radio spectrum , however , is not significantly different from historical low -

infrared ( nir ) continuum . <n> the millimeter , submillimeter , and millimeter - nir data span timescales from minutes to years and are consistent with each other , with no evidence for significant variations in the spectral index , variability amplitude , or mean flux density . on the other hand we present new vla , alma , and sma observations of sgr a*. over the past 30 years , the millimeter / submillimeter spectral index has remained remarkably stable , with no evidence for enhanced emission caused by the passage of g2 .<n> this stability is consistent with the long - term stability of the radio through millimeter spectrum , which indicates that g2 has not been significantly disrupted . in the case of low - frequency emission ,<n> the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole . the millimeter spectrum is likely to originate from a stratified region with optical depth in transition between optically thick and thin . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : active ; quasars : general ; x -

axis dos in the ml , while there is no significant correlation in the dos of the v- and v - band . in the low temperature region ,<n> there is an abrupt increase in the number of dos with decreasing temperature , which can be attributed to an increase in electron - phonon coupling . at high temperatures , we observe a decrease in both the number and the character of the low - energy dos as a function of temperature . <n> the study of strongly correlated electron systems has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of davis , lamb , and ross @xcite in the 1960 s . since then , there has been increasing interest in studying electron systems with strong electron correlations , due to their relevance to a variety of fields , such as the field - effect transistor @ we report on the development of a novel method for the fabrication and characterization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices .<n> the method is based on the application of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) to a periodic array of optical elements , such as tips , couplers , and couplers between neighboring elements . for the first time , we demonstrate the operation of such an amplifier in a 1d geometry , by applying it to a 2d array of coupled optical elements and observing the response of the array to the amplifier s output . <n> optical parametric amplifiers ( opos ) @xcite are one of the most powerful tools for the study of nonlinear phenomena , especially in the presence of nonlinearity . in nonlinear systems ,<n> parametric amplifiers are often used as quantum - mechanical ( qm ) mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometers to probe the nonlinear properties of the system , as well as to determine the fundamental parameters of the nonlinear response . however , in many cases , parametric amplifiers can not be directly used to measure the nonlinear optical response , because the nonlinearity in the system is not captured by the parametric amplifier  we report on the discovery of a new type of gravitational instability , induced by the transverse expansion of a relativistic plasma .<n> the instability is due to the transverse motion of the plasma in the vicinity of a gravitational wave source , and is characterized by the development of an anomalously high amplitude of gravitational waves . in this letter , we report the first results of a systematic search for such an effect in relativistic plasmas , using ultra - low - energy x - ray and gamma - ray observations of relativistic jets from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . <n> the detection of gravitational wave ( gw ) signals from relativistic jets is one of the most exciting and challenging experimental findings of the rhic era @xcite . at the highest energies ,<n> the gw signal is dominated by the gravitational wave background ( grb ) , produced by the interaction between the relativistic jets and the surrounding medium , while at the lowest energies the grb signal is modulated by the inelastic scattering between grb and the medium . as a result , gw signals are observed over a wide range of angular scales , from sub - millisecond to tens of meters , with a we present the results of a study of the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) at redshifts @xmath0 using high - resolution , high - s / n , very large array ( vla ) and very large telescope ( vlt ) data .<n> we focus our study on the collision dynamics of a pair of relativistic , co - eval , ultracompact binaries ( ucb ) , and compare their total luminosities to those of a binary system composed of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) with a main - sequence ( ms) star and a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . <n> we find that the collision velocities of the two systems are very similar , with a typical ratio of the hic velocities of 0.65 . however , the total luminosity of the system is significantly lower than that of the ms system , which we attribute to the lower mass of the bsgs , as well as to the presence of a higher mass companion , both of which play an important role in the dynamics of the collision . in the case of the binary system<n> , we find in this work , we study the reissner - nordstr@xmath0 ( rns ) effect in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to the polarization of the cosmic rays emitted by the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .<n> we find that the cmb polarization is strongly dependent on the direction of the observer s polarization . in the direction perpendicular to the observer<n> s direction , the polarization is maximal for the highest energy cmb states . on the other hand , in the orthogonal direction<n> , there is no polarization , except for the lowest energy states , for which the polarization decreases with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy . <n> _ keywords _ : polarization ; cmb radiation we report the discovery of a pair of x -

particle symposium ( ams12 ) at the gran sasso national observatory ( nso ) in italy . in the event of discovery , it will be the first pulsar to be discovered during a sub - millisecond period of its orbit around the galaxy . <n> pulsars are very special objects in that they not only provide unique information about the nature of their host stars , but also allow us to probe the fundamental properties of the universe at very short periods of time . among many pulsars ,<n> the lmc pulsar is of particular interest because it is known to have a very long orbital period ( @xmath0 s ) @xcite  we report on the discovery of a pair of gravitationally bound black holes in a binary system .<n> the black holes are separated by about 10 gravitational radii and the binary system has a common proper motion of the two black holes , which is equal to the orbital period of the system , and the separation is @xmath0 gravitational radii . in the standard model of black hole formation ,<n> the minimum mass of a black hole is set by the mass of the black hole itself , while the maximum mass is given by the ratio of the gravitational redshift of the binary to the binary redshift . <n> the formation of black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is common in both the milky way ( mw ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but the nature of bhs in these galaxies is not well understood . since most bhs form in binary systems , it is reasonable to assume that the bh mass distribution in agn is skewed towards a hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram with a large mass ratio between the bh and its companion , as is often done in the study of gravitational waves ( gws  we present the results of our follow - up timing analysis of the x -

giraffe ( asa - giraffe ) and the atacama large millimetre / sub - millimetre array ( alma ) telescopes . from our analysis ,<n> we conclude that the x - rays are produced by the interaction of the sn ejecta with the dense interstellar medium ( ism ) in the host galaxy , rather than from the interaction with the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , as in the case of the local snr , and that it is most likely due to the interaction between the sn remnant and the dense ism in the local universe . <n> we also present the first detection of a x -ray transient ( xrt ) from the sn 201409",

linear generalization of the usual einstein - maxwell - gauss ( emg ) gauge theory @xcite . among the many applications that have been studied in this context , one of the most fascinating is the possibility of realizing susy in the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssem ) of the theory , for which we now know that it can be realized in the simplest form , namely as the minimal extension of the sgssm . the simplest version of the ms supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been extensively studied in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally .<n> one of the most prominent of these is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , introduced by sakharov in 1983@xcite . in this theory ,<n> the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the electroweak scale . at the same time , supersymmetry breaking is _ not _ invariant under susy - breaking , so that the theory is restricted to one copy . <n> recently , we have shown that this restriction can be relaxed by means of grassmannian ultralocality ( wt ) in the context of the minimal susy sm . here<n> we show how wt can be used to derive the flow equations for susy breaking in this model , and we give explicit results for the case where the cut - off is chosen to be of the same order as the curvature of the theory at the origin , as in the case of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite<n> . then , we present a nonperturbative implementation of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow for a supersymmetric ( susy ) scalar field theory in dimension @xmath0 , restricted to a single copy of spacetime .<n> we show that the rg flow leads to the spontaneous breaking of some ( super)symmetries or identities along the flow , which invalidates the susy property of dimensional reduction . as a result ,<n> the theory is characterized by the breakdown of superrotational invariance , ground - state dominance , and  grassmannian ultralocality '' , all of which are encoded in the wt - lorentz invariance of the theory . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.pb , 12.60.jv , 05.70.fh , 11.10.kk the study of supersymmetric field theories has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of parisi and sourlas@xcite . in their seminal paper , they considered the problem of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of susy field theories , _<n> i.e. _ , supersymmetric theories that preserve sus we present a new class of random -

field ising model ( rfim ) can be described by a minimal truncation that explicitly breaks supersymmetry ( susy ) .<n> the resulting effective field theory ( eft ) has the same long - distance physics as the rfim and is governed by a universal fixed point . near this fixed point<n> , the eft exhibits a rich phenomenology , including the existence of a non - trivial fixed point at which the system undergoes a first - order phase transition to a ferromagnetic phase , and a second - order transition to an antiferromagnetic phase that is controlled by the critical exponents . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.wx , 11.30.rd , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk in recent years , much effort has been devoted to the study of the critical properties of the two -

abelian gauge theory that is completely consistent with the predictions of the standard model in the vacuum and on the physical background of qcd . due to the absence of ultraviolet divergences ,<n> we present a nonperturbative approach to the dynamics of superfluid helium-3 .<n> it is based on a renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the effective average action , which is solved exactly in the limit where the superfluid mass @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse uv scale . in this limit<n> , the rg equation reduces to the well - known schwinger - dyson equation ( wt ) for the one - loop superfluid density of states , and the wt relation is recovered . <n> the present approach provides a unified framework for the study of the flow of a superfluid in the presence of an external magnetic field , as in the problem of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with a quantized magnetic field in an anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometry , for example in a superconductor , or in a fluid with dynamical viscosity , such as in a liquid helium-3 ( qed ) system . for a 3d system ,<n> the flow is governed by a pair of rg equations , one of which ( eq . ( [ eq_wt_susy_ we present a superfield formalism for the flow of a random field in dimension @xmath0 .<n> the flow equations are proven to be valid at zero temperature and zero auxiliary temperature , and to reduce to the flow equation for the random field on a finite  larkin '' scale in the limit of large dimension . <n> random fields are ubiquitous in physics and engineering . in particular , they play a central role in random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , quantum field theory ( qft ) , as well as in the foundations of statistical mechanics , such as the lagrangian , the poincar - birkhoff - strauss ( pbs ) equation , or the ricci - schwinger ( ssw ) equations . despite their ubiquity , however , random fields do not play a trivial role in many practical applications . for example , it is well known that the hamiltonian of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can not be decomposed into a supersymmetric ( susy ) part and an antisymmetric part , even though susy is manifest in the bec itself@xcite we present a superfield formalism for the description of the critical behavior of the random field ising model ( rfim ) in the presence of a cusp .<n> the formalism is based on a set of coupled frg equations with appropriate boundary conditions , and it allows us to address the long -

einstein condensation ( bec ) , high - temperature superconductors , superfluid helium-3 , or phase transitions . to this end , in recent years , a large number of papers have been devoted to the analysis of nonlinear interactions close to fixed points of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , either with or without a gradient term in the action . for instance , the we consider the critical behavior of a critical ising spin system in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we use a renormalization -

gluon plasma formed in high - energy collisions . a detailed description of the lattice boltzmann model ( lbt ) that has been developed over the last few years and improvements to the early versions that have been used for the study of jet transport and medium modifications in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is given .<n> the model is used to study elastic energy loss through multiple scattering , propagation of jet - induced medium excitations , and their contributions to parton distribution and jet profiles of reconstructed jets using the anti-@xmath0 algorithm in fastjet . in particular , the energy and time or length dependence in a static and uniform qgp medium is investigated . a diffusion wake generated behind a propagating parton<n> effectively modifies the underlying fluid background and therefore affects jet reconstruction . these effects can all be studied within the lbt model and are important for understanding the medium modified jet cross section and jet profile . since interaction in pqcd between an energetic parton and the thermal medium is dominated by small - angle scatterings and therefore a large fraction of thermal recoil partons from jet - medium interaction fall within the jet cone and therefore should become a part of the reconstructed jet , their contribution to the jet energy profile and parton distributions is studied . finally , contributions using the linear boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model for hard parton scattering in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium and monte carlo simulations of the transport equation , we study jet energy loss and medium recoil parton propagation in a static and uniform qgp medium .<n> we find that the energy loss from multiple scattering depends on the initial parton energy as @xmath0 , and the time or length of the propagation of the leading parton depends on its transverse momentum as a function of the final - state momentum , the scattering angle of the parton , as well as the scattering temperature . in a uniform and static medium ,<n> the energy deposited by an energetic parton in the medium can give rise to a supersonic shock wave along with a diffusion wake , which leads to the formation of a jet - like structure in the final state . for a uniform medium with a large longitudinal momentum fraction of the outgoing jet , a diffractive shock wave<n> is expected to develop in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the shock wave propagation . using the anti-@xmath1 algorithm in the fastjet jet finding package , it is shown that the jet energy can be we develop a monte carlo model for hard parton scattering in thermal qgp media . the model is based on the boltzmann transport equation with a lorentz - invariant interaction kernel . in this paper<n> , we study the dependence of the model results on the number of active quark flavors , the incident energy , and the temperature of the medium .<n> we also study the effect of the quark mass on the model predictions . <n> the study of parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium has been an important topic in qcd physics since the early days of qcd @xcite . since qcd is a strongly interacting theory ,<n> parton interactions in a qgp medium must be treated in a non - perturbative way . to treat parton interaction in a medium with finite baryon chemical potential , which is a typical situation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , it is necessary to develop a formalism that can describe parton transport in a thermal medium , as well as parton rescatterings in the high - energy limit @xmath0 . here<n> we present a model for the parton we study the parton scattering in a static and uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we show that the total scattering rate in a uniform qgp medium increases linearly with the temperature while that for a static medium increases quadratically . as a consequence ,<n> the angular distribution of the final parton in a @math1 scattering has a universal form @xcite . in the presence of a qcd phase transition , however , the final state partons are no longer localized to the ground state of the medium but diffuse out to infinity , a phenomenon that has been observed in lattice qcd simulations . <n> the scattering of thermal partons in a thermal qgp ( tqgp , hereafter referred to as qgp \" ) has been studied extensively in the literature , both in simulations and experiments . at fixed parton energies , qgp interactions are described by the relativistic boltzmann equation ( rbe ) , which in turn is derived from the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equation . for fixed values of the incident parton energy and the qgp phase transition temperature we study the energy spectra of outgoing partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we show that the parton - medium interaction leads to the appearance of a new energy spectrum of the outgoing gluon which is characterized by an exponential fall - off with a slope given by the temperature . <n> the energy distribution of the final parton in a qgp medium is very sensitive to the initial energy of the incoming parton , since the outgoing parton carries most of the incident energy . as a result<n> , the energy distributions of the produced partons can be very different from those of the unscattered partons . in this paper<n> we study parton interactions in a thermal qgp at finite temperatures @xcite . the interaction between a parton and the medium is described by an effective lagrangian in which the interaction term is proportional to the temperature and the partonic degrees of freedom are described in terms of the medium - modified hamiltonian . at temperatures below the deconfinement transition ,<n> the interactions between partons are dominated by gluon - quark scattering . above the transition<n> the interaction terms between gluons and quarks we discuss jet - induced medium excitation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions due to multiple parton scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we show that the energy of the thermal recoil parton in the small - angle parton - medium scatterings is larger than the typical thermal energy , and therefore is dragged along in the same direction of the incident parton . as a result ,<n> the polar angle of the outgoing parton from the thermal scatterings with the incoming parton is smaller than that in the elastic scatterings , which results in a large excitation of the jet . <n> multiple scattering of quarks and gluons in a hot and dense qgp medium has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in the non - relativistic regime , where the energy density of the medium is much higher than the thermal energy density @xmath0 , the process is known as hard thermal parton ( htp ) scattering . however , in the relativistic regime where the temperature is much lower , or qgp is expected to be isotropically - dense , hard htp scattering is not expected to occur . instead , it has been we study the parton - medium scattering and the jet - induced medium excitation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions using a monte carlo approach .<n> we focus mainly on elastic scattering processes in the quark -

parton scattering .<n> the final parton spectra and energy - momentum density of the jet - induced medium excitation are studied in monte carlo simulations . <n> the transverse - momentum distribution and elastic energy loss of an energetic parton propagating in a qgp medium are studied . to take into account the back - reaction in the boltzmann transport equation ,<n> the parton is allowed to transport further according to the transport equation and to undergo additional scatterings in the subsequent time intervals . using the small - angle approximation of @xmath0 scattering , we estimate the averaged transverse momentum squared per unit length and the elastic energy lost during the propagation of an initial parton in a static qgp and compare it with the experimental data from hera . at hera<n> , the energy loss and the average transverse momentum broadening of a leading part leading parton transport in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature is studied within the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> we show that the energy dependence of the energy loss in a single parton - parton scattering is larger than that from multiple scatterings over a long distance , especially for more energetic quarks at lower temperatures . in a uniform qgp at a temperature @xmath0 mev , we find that the elastic energy loss per unit mean - free - path increases with the energy of the initial parton . at higher temperatures , however , the results from lbt simulations are in good agreement with those from perturbative qcd calculations . <n> the study of the thermal evolution of partons in a hot and dense qcd medium has been a long - standing goal of high - energy physics research @xcite . during the last decade<n> , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the development of the lbt model , which is a lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) inspired transport approach , and has been successfully applied to a large variety of problems in high energy physics , such as heavy - ion collisions we study the energy loss of gluons and quarks in a hot qcd medium using a lattice - based perturbative qcd ( lbt ) model .<n> we investigate the propagation of a gluon and a quark in a uniform and static medium with a temperature @xmath0 , and compute the averaged elastic energy loss per mean free path along the propagation path for different initial parton energies and medium temperatures . <n> qcd is a theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with strong interactions between quarks and gluons . in qcd<n> , the interaction energy between a parton and the thermal parton is proportional to the energy of the parton . as a result , in a thermal medium , partons lose their energy by scattering off thermal partons , which in turn lose energy by interacting with the medium . at high temperatures ,<n> parton - parton scatterings are strongly modified by the presence of the medium and the energy dependence of parton energy loss can be described by a small - angle approximation ( sa ) @xcite . however , at low temperatures and/or high energies , energy and momentum are conserved during each scattering , leading to parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is simulated within the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> parton energy loss is calculated by including the energy and momentum lost by the propagating parton due to multiple scattering in the qgp medium . in the lbt model ,<n> energy is conserved in each parton - medium scattering and the energy spectrum of the parton propagating in the medium is shown to consist of thermal recoil partons plus jet - induced medium partons which are carried by the leading parton . to study jet transport and medium excitations at the same time , both of the outgoing partons in each @xmath0-channel scattering<n> , we also calculate the energy spectra of the leading and thermal recoil partson , as well as the energy distribution of leading partons minus negative \" partons at different times in the propagation of partons . <n> partons propagating in a hot and dense qcd medium are expected to lose a significant fraction of their energy in the process of propagation @xcite . as a result , partons should deposit significant amount of energy into the medium , which can be detected experimentally in high - energy heavy -  we study the propagation of jet - induced medium partons in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium using the longitudinal boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model .<n> the energy and momentum lost to the qgp medium by the propagating parton will act like a source for the excitation of the medium parton through the propagation and transport of the jet - inducing medium partions . in the lbt model ,<n> the leading parton from each @xmath0 scattering is also allowed to further propagate and interact with the medium through the back - reaction in the transport equation . as a result<n> , we find that the energy density distributions of the excitations induced by a propagating gluon are similar to those of a propagating medium gluon with a longitudinal momentum fraction of the order of the initial one . <n> we also study the reconstruction of the parton spectrum from the energy loss and the medium excitations . for a given initial parton momentum fraction , the reconstructed parton spectra are almost independent of the incident parton s energy . however , if the initial energy fraction is larger than a threshold value , there is a significant difference between the reconstructed spectra and the unreconstructed ones we study jet - induced medium parton interactions in heavy ion collisions using a linear response theory ( lbt ) model and monte carlo simulations . we show that energy density distributions of medium recoil and negative \" partons are sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton during its propagation in a qgp medium .<n> we also show that the energy density distribution of the medium partons depends on the angle between the propagation direction of the parton and the medium temperature . <n> the interaction of hard partons with a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is one of the most important processes in high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments . in these collisions ,<n> partons produced in the initial hard interaction interact with the medium at a high energy density , lose energy and momentum via parton - medium interaction , and produce partons in the final state @xcite . as a result , a parton with an initial energy @xmath0 gev<n> will propagate in a uniform medium of hadrons with a temperature of a few gev and a baryon number density of 10@xmath1 at a mean temperature of 2 mev . at the final stage in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , partons produced in the gluon - gluon fusion reaction lose a significant fraction of their energy to the subsequent propagation of a parton in the hot and dense medium created by the collision .<n> we study the angular distribution of such partons and their dependence on the initial energy of the propagating parton , the temperature of the medium , and the transverse momentum of the leading parton within the large hadron collider ( lbt ) monte carlo framework . using a modified version of the fastjet code with the anti-@xmath0 algorithm for jet reconstruction , we find that the angular distributions of the partons have azimuthal anisotropy that depends on the temperature and the initial parton energy , but not on the transverse momenta of the jet - induced medium partons . <n> the energy loss of partons in the initial stages of the collision plays an important role in understanding the mechanism of parton production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . during the early stage ,<n> partons created in the collision lose a substantial fraction ( @xmath1 ) of their initial energy to propagation in a hot , we study the propagation of a fast parton in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) by including parton hadronization effects and large - angle scatterings of jet - induced medium partons in the leading parton model ( lbt ) .<n> we find that the energy loss of the propagating parton due to the interaction with the qgp medium leads to significant broadening of the final hadronic jets and a significant reduction of their spectra , compared to a reconstructed jet with the same energy but without medium parton interaction . <n> the study of jet spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe the properties of qcd matter at temperatures and baryon densities inaccessible to hadron colliders ( hics ) such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron electron ( lhc ) @xcite . in these collisions ,<n> the rapidity and azimuthal angle distributions of the produced hadrons are known to be well described by the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , which has been well tested experimentally at rhic energies . however , in order to understand the leading partons propagating through a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium lose a significant amount of energy during their propagation through the medium . during propagation ,<n> the energetic leading parton experiences transverse momentum broadening due to interaction with medium partons .<n> the energy of the energetic parton is subtracted from both the parton distribution function and the total jet energy during the propagation . as a result , reconstructed jets contain both energetic and medium parton - induced partons inside the jet cone , but with a net transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . <n> the propagation of energetic partons through a hot and dense qgp medium has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in this study , we focus on the jet propagation and its evolution with time in a uniform medium at a constant temperature @xmath0 mev . due to the finite jet - cone size , medium partonic scatterings and diffusion<n> are expected to lead to a reduction of the jet energy and transverse momentum , as well as an enhancement of the soft parton distributions . however , the energy loss and the composition of reconstructed jets are found to be sensitive to the medium - parton interaction  the evolution of a high energy parton propagating through a qgp medium is studied at different times in terms of the momentum fraction of the reconstructed jet energy .<n> the initial parton energy is varied from 100 gev to 1000 gev in a uniform medium at a temperature @xmath0 mev , and it propagates through the medium with a modified fragmentation function . at later times , the leading parton loses energy to the medium , which is carried away by thermal recoil partons . as a result ,<n> the transverse profile of reconstructed jets is broadened and the width of the jet cone is reduced . <n> the study of parton propagation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe the properties of qcd matter under extreme conditions , such as the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , created in the collision @xcite . in particular , one of the most important aspects of the qgp is the formation of a deconfined phase of matter , called the qcd phase diagram , where the initial temperature and the chemical composition of the medium are expected to be of the order of the critical temperatures of the hot and dense qgp matter @x the leading parton transport ( lbt ) model describes the propagation of a high energy parton in a quark -

out temperature , etc . have been extensively studied in order to understand the formation of the hot and dense qgp created at the rhic energy density . however , very little is known about the collective behavior of the matter created at high energy density due to the lack of precise measurements of the multiplicity spectra of the emitted particles . on the other hand , such measurements are essential for the understanding of the early stage of the evolution of the system created in a heavy -

called pentropy inequality , which states that , for a given configuration of agents in a markov chain , the log - sobolev constant of the associated process is bounded from below by a constant which depends on the configuration and the speed of the averaging process . the proof of this inequality requires a number of technical tools , including the theory of reversible chains @x we consider the opinion dynamics of a finite number of agents @xmath0 , each of which has a different opinion @xcite , interacting via a random interaction with their neighbors .<n> this model has been studied extensively , both in the finite and infinite lattice settings . in the infinite lattice case<n> , it has been shown that the dynamics of this model are completely determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of the system . for the finite -

time upper bound on the number of opinions needed to form a majority opinion in the process . for the special case where the opinions are  ordered '' ( i.e. , all the agents have the same opinion ) , the upper bound coincides with the kolmogorov - smirnov time . finally , for the general case where opinions are not ordered , as well as for some special cases of the two - opinion model ( for example , where all agents have equal opinions ) we prove the existence of exponential consensus times . the idea that opinion formation can be described by dynamical systems has been around for more than a century @xcite , starting with the work we propose a new stochastic model of the discrete logarithm of the number of agents in a multi - agent system .<n> the model is based on the concept of the _ tokenization process _ : initially each agent has a collection ( cluster ) of tokens . at time @xmath0 each agent gives his tokens to the other agents . <n> tokenization is a stochastic process in which agents interact by exchanging their tokens with the help of a distributed random number generator . in the case of multi - agents systems ,<n> this number generator is a random variable , which can be expressed in the form of a markov chain , a gaussian , or a poisson process , depending on the characteristics of the token distribution . as an example<n> , we consider the case where agents interact with each other only through the exchange of their tokens , i.e. , the so - called _ discrete logarithm _ ( d@xmath1 ) . for this model<n> we derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of the total number of tokens exchanged between two agents , for arbitrary initial conditions , and show that the distribution depends on the underlying dynamics of the system only through we consider the motion of a binary mixture of markov chains in two dimensions .<n> the markov chain particles move at half -

cluster separation . we find that the coalesced state is characterized by a power - law distribution of cluster separations , with exponents that depend on the binary mixture parameters , such as the ratio of rates of change of initial configuration to final configuration , as well as the particle number . <n> * keywords : * binary mixture , markov process , coalescence , clustering * pacs :* 05.40.-a , 05.45.-a in this note , i give a short survey of recent work on the finite voter model .<n> i also discuss some open problems . <n> the voter model @xcite is a simple model of a population of individuals , of which there are @xmath0 choices at each point in time , and each chooses one of these two choices at a time . in this model ,<n> the individual s actions ( opinions ) influence the outcome of the election , which is decided by the combined action of the population at each time instant . for a complete graph @xxmath1 of individuals<n> , there is a markov chain of states that evolves as the population evolves , with rates that scale with the number of individuals in the chain . at each instant , each individual decides one of its two opinions by making a decision in the direction of the other s opinion . the mean hitting time to a state<n> is called the _ coalescence time _ of the markov chains , defined here as the time until the entire chain of chains coalesces to form a single particle . from the perspective of statistical physics , this is the simplest non - trivial example of a non - equilibrium process we consider the voter model and a variant of it , the so - called fmie voter model , in which two specified agents are randomly assigned different opinions , initially .<n> we show that the mean meeting time between the specified agents is asymptotically @xmath0 times the mean time between two arbitrary agents , on a complete graph @xcite . in the fmie model<n> , this means that the meeting time can be computed from the speed of the associated markov chain ( mc ) . <n> we also consider the variant in which only two agents are specified , and show that there is an upper bound on the mean meetings time of these two agents . as a byproduct of the analysis ,<n> we obtain a lower bound for the spectral gap of the mc associated with the voter process , which is of the correct order of magnitude . *<n> introduction : * in a classic paper by cox , he showed that the distribution of the time it takes for an agent to change his opinion ( the  voter model '' ) is _ not _ asymptotically gaussian , but it has a _ bottleneck _ behavior , namely , if two agents change their opinion we prove that the mean meeting time of @xmath0 independent identically distributed (  fmie '' ) walkers on the two - dimensional torus is asymptotically larger than the mean time for the corresponding standard random walk on the torus to meet . <n> the result applies to the finite voter model @xcite , and also to a variety of special geometries .<n> the proof is elementary , in the sense that it does not rely on theorem [ t_oliveira ] , which would have given the same bound for all regular graphs . as a corollary of the result ,<n> we show that the number of fmie walkers meeting in the same place at the same time is bounded above by the number ( in units of the diameter ) of neighbors at which the meeting time has been reached in the previous interval ; this number depends on the geometry , but is of order unity for regular graphs and of order one for infinite - dimensional lattices . in a series of recent papers , we have studied fmie models on various finite geometries , including the toroidal lattice , the cylinder , a cone on the half - line , as well as the fano plane @x we consider a model of self - avoiding walks on a random graph , with the property that the number of walkers on the graph at time @xmath0 is a random variable depending only on the positions of the walkers .<n> the model is a generalization of the well - known voter model @xcite , where walkers are assumed to obey the same voting rules . in the limit of large distances between walkers , the model exhibits epidemic - like behavior . <n> _ keywords _ : epidemics , random graphs , fpp models , non -

[ cols= \"  ,  \" ,<n> ] it has been known for a long time that a random walk on a graph can have either a deterministic or a random state , depending on the position of the walker . for the latter case , it is well known that the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding model on the infinite lattice is governed by the nash equilibrium principle , which states that the distribution of the state of a walker is independent of its position in the lattice . on the other hand , for the deterministic model , there has been no consensus on the form of the in this paper , we consider the stochastic evolution of a large class of stochastic processes , which includes stochastic fractional brownian motion ( sbm ) , stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) and stochastic volatility models ( srrms ) among others .<n> we provide a general expression for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of stochastically moving parts of the stochastic process . as an application ,<n> we derive the pdf of the mean first passage time ( fps ) through the stochastic boundary of the sbm in the case of stochastic sbm and stochastic spde . <n> _ keywords _ : stochastic processes ( theory ) + pacs : 02.50.-r , 02.50.ey , 05.40.+j + i prove a long - standing conjecture concerning a certain stochastic process on a weighted graph . on a complete graph<n> , this process is an augmentation of the kingman coalescent process , in that each agent has a different  token '' .<n> when two agents meet , they exchange tokens . <n> i call this the interchange process ;

field approximation . however , at high densities , the interactions among quarks become important , such that the free quarks can no longer be described by a free particle and have to be treated as a composite of quarks and antiquarks . as a consequence , the landau effective mass of a two - flavor imbalanced quark system is calculated analytically and numerically in the limit of weak coupling .<n> it is shown that the quark - antiquark interaction is mediated by the emission or absorption of a gluon , depending on the sign of the gluon relative to the color and spin indices . in the flavor - imbalanced case , the distributions depend only on the flavor but not on the spin degrees of freedom . the quasiparticle energy and effective interaction<n> are obtained by varying the thermodynamic potential with respect to the fermi distribution . <n> quarks and antiquarks are the building blocks of quark matter , and the interaction between them can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @math1 is the qcd coupling constant . for a system of two quarks , two anti - quarks or a quark and an anti -quark @xcite ,<n> the effective interaction is given by the exchange diagram , i.e. , by the two exchange diagrams in the lorentz gauge , which are defined in terms of the color , spin and color - space indices , respectively . as a consequence  we study the interaction of quarks and gluons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we consider the case of flavor imbalance , i.e. , when the color and spin degrees of freedom of the plasma are different from those of the background qcd matter . in the weak interaction limit , we find that the interaction between two quarks is the dominant contribution to the effective interaction , while in the strong interaction limit it is only about @xmath0 of the total interaction between gluons and quarks . <n> the study of quark and gluon interactions in qcd has a long history , starting with the seminal works of bethe - salpeter and heisenberg @xcite , and more recently with the results of brueckner and hartree - fock ( hf ) for qcd in the limit of vanishing baryon density , where the problem of the confinement of the particles has been solved . since then , a large amount of work has been done in order to understand the behavior of the interactions between quarks in a plasma of hadrons , or gluons , in the regime of strong interactions @x we study the effective mass and chemical potential of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the lowest order in the coupling constant @xmath0 .<n> we show that the quark self - energy in the qgp has a significant effect on the average effective mass of the system , as well as on the chemical potential . for a qgp with small imbalance between the majority and minority quark flavors ,<n> we find that the average mass is larger than that in the balanced case , and that the effective chemical potential is smaller than in the imbalanced case . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.ba , 14.40.nd , 14.65.fy in refs . @xcite , we have shown that the mass difference between the average and imbalanced quarks in a qcd - like system can be quantitatively understood in terms of the landau quantization of the energy - momentum tensor of the gluon . in this letter<n> we extend the analysis to the lowest - order coupling constant , i.e. , in the nonperturbative regime , to show that in this approximation the interaction is color- and spin - independent . we show that the quasiparticle pole of the quark propagator and the renormalized positive - energy projected quark self - energy at zero temperature are consistent with the phenominological landau argument .<n> we also find that the average effective mass is @xmath0 , and the ratio of the effective mass difference to the mass difference between quasiparticle and gluon poles is approximately unity . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.hg , 14.40.nd , 14.65.dw in recent years , a lot of attention has been paid to the problem of the apparent discrepancy between the lattice qcd results and the experimental data @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been realized that the dynamical quark - antiquark ( qcd ) theory , which was originally formulated in the framework of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) approach , breaks down in the vicinity of the deconfinement / chiral - symmetry - breaking ( d / csb ) transition due to the appearance of the gluonic quasiparticles of the color - singlet ( cs ) representation of the qcd vacuum . we calculate the temperature dependence of the large-@xmath0 thermodynamic potential of a quark - gluon plasma at finite temperature @xmath1 in the framework of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) theory .<n> we find that at low temperatures the thermodynamic potential is dominated by the plasmon modes , while at high temperatures it has a non - monotonic behavior due to the renormalization of the vacuum . in the limit of high quark densities ,<n> the thermodynamics of the system can be described by the microscopic diagrammatic theory , which is in good agreement with the phenominological landau argument . <n> the quark system is the simplest example of a strongly interacting system that can be studied in the microscopic theory of qcd , and its microscopic calculation can be carried out in the same way as in the standard model ( sm ) , using the rpa method @xcite . as a result , the microscopic calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quark systems is much simpler than in the sm , since the microscopic equations of motion are identical to those of the sm in its low - energy limit . however , in the presence of strong interactions , such as in q we investigate the low - temperature behavior of an ideal gas of quarks and gluons with mass imbalance .<n> we find that the ideal - gas contribution to the thermodynamic potential density has a minimum at zero temperature , which is a consequence of the gauge invariance of the theory . as a result<n> , the ideal gas has a nonzero gluon thermal mass , @xmath0 , at low temperatures . <n> quark and gluon mass imbalance ( qmu ) is one of the most striking predictions of qcd @xcite . in qcd<n> there are two main types of mass imbalances : ( i ) mass imbalance in the quark sector alone or in the gluon sector alone , and ( ii ) quark mass imbalance between different flavors . for the former type of mass imbalance<n> there is the well - known mass imbalance problem , while for the latter type of imbalance there is no mass imbalance at all and the system is extremely imbalanced , i.e. each quark has a mass that is larger than the other quarks by a factor of two or more . on the other hand , in the qcd side , there are also other mass imbalance problems we study the thermodynamics of a two - flavor imbalanced quark system at finite temperature @xmath0 and zero baryon density .<n> we show that the leading - order rpa corrections to the thermodynamic potential density and the ideal - gas contribution to the gluon self - energies are anomalously small and of the same order as the quark thermal mass , while the leading rpa correction to the ideal gas law is of the order of the thermal quark mass . <n> quark - antiquark imbalance is one of the most striking predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , which is based on the hypothesis that quarks and antiquarks have different thermal masses . in qcd<n> the difference between the masses of the two quarks is proportional to the chemical potential , and thus to the mass of the quarks . as a consequence<n> , a quark imbalance in a hot and dense medium is expected to be larger than a qcd imbalance in an empty medium , due to the effect of thermal gluons . for an ideal quark gas ,<n> the chemical pressure is much smaller than the temperature , so that the difference of the masses between the two fermions we study the transverse and longitudinal production and decay of thermal gluons due to @xmath0-corrections to the thermodynamics of an ideal gas .<n> we find that the transverse gluons are mainly produced by particle - hole creation , while the longitudinal gluons can only be produced by a mixture effect of the two flavors . in the high - density limit ,<n> the specific heat and the first landau parameter of an imbalanced ideal gas are also obtained . <n> the thermodynamic properties of hot and dense qcd matter have been studied intensively in recent years @xcite , due to their relevance for the early stages of the collision of heavy nuclei , as well as for the problem of the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) from the deconfined quarks and gluons of the hadron - hadron plasma ( hmp ) produced in the collision . for the description of the qgp it is necessary to include the interaction between the quarks , which is usually treated as a small coupling constant ( lhc ) . however , the lhc is not strong enough to solve the strong - coupling problem of qcd , since it is not possible to solve we calculate the thermodynamic potential in the large-@xmath0 limit and the effective mass of cold dense quarks by using fermi - liquid theory for an imbalanced system .<n> the logarithmic dependence on temperature of the specific heat and effective mass signals a breakdown of fermi- liquid theory at zero - temperature . from the rpa results ,<n> the logarithm of the temperature dependence signals a breakdowns of qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat at large @xmath1 . <n> the thermodynamics of a quark system is a topic of much current interest @xcite . in the ideal gas limit , perturbative calculations of thermodynamic properties<n> have been carried out using group theory factors , dimensional reduction , hard - dense loop qcd perturbation theory , and dimensional regularization . at low densities , however , group theory is no longer applicable , since the non - abelian effects show up only if gluon self - interaction corrections are included . as a result , the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas , such as specific heat , effective mass , entropy density , etc . can be calculated analytically within the weak - coupling approximation , or numerically within the renormalization group ( we discuss the logarithmic dependence of the qcd thermodynamic potential and specific heat on temperature in the large-@xmath0 limit .<n> the logarithmic behavior in the balanced case has previously been seen in analytic and numerical calculations of the quark matter specific heat using the large - @xmath1 limit , dimensional reduction , and hard - dense loop qcd perturbation theory . to better understand these effects , it is necessary to go further , such as including the gluon self - interaction and extending our discussion to the three - flavor imbalanced case . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] the spin structure of a system of massless quarks and gluons is investigated . in the massless case , the spin of the particle is found to be zero .<n> however , in the case of a massive quark and gluon it is found that the spin is negative and that the system has a spin - spin interaction of the form @xmath0=fracp_munuq2+frac xiq$ ] . <n> the study of spin effects in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has a long history and has led to the formulation of the dirac equation @xcite , which is a relativistic version of the schwinger - dyson - schwinger ( sdss ) equation , with the aim of describing the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . at low energies ,<n> the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) of a gluon and a quark in a qgp is described by the hamiltonian , while at high energies it is given by the qcd lagrangian . since the two equations of motion for the qgp are identical , minkowski quantum field theory is turned into a euclidean statistical field theory suitable for studying the dynamical properties of a many -

momentum tensor , i.e. the quark - quark ( qqq ) relation , observed in the heavy - ion collision experiments  the dynamical properties of a many - particle system are derived from the euclidean statistical field theory of quantum chromodynamics .<n> it is shown that the interaction of quarks and gluons in qcd is given by the ghost -

for example , in the setting of hamiltonian quantum mechanics ( hm ) it has been shown that a chain can be approximated by a chain of hm particles , as well as by the solution of a certain system of partial differential equations ( pde ) and by a certain type of  we prove that the littelmann paths from @xmath0 to @xcite form a crystal , and we show that the corresponding colored directed graph does not depend on the initial path .<n> we also show that there is a bijection between the corresponding admissible subsets . <n> this paper is a continuation of a paper by kashiwara , joseph , stembridge ( see below ) , where we considered the crystal structure of fixed - path systems ( or kac - moody algebras ) and we introduced the notion of a _ path _ , which is a generalization of a path to an arbitrary continuous variable . in this paper , we consider the crystal - like structure of the corresponding kac_- moody algebra<n> . we will recall the definition of a kac _ moody algebra _ as follows : an algebra in the setup of complex symmetrizable kac- or moody - algebras is obtained from a fixed path via a root operator . a path is said to be _ kac@xmath1 _ if it is invariant under a left - hand derivative , if it can be deformed into a right - handed derivative at each step  we show that there are @xmath0-deformed perfect crystals in the space of littelmann paths that are in the bruhat order .<n> we also show that these perfect crystals have the structure of a perfect crystal . <n> the study of perfect crystals was initiated by kashiwara , lakshmibai , and joseph @xcite , who proved the following result : given any @x , there is a finitely generated perfect crystal in the following sense : for any fixed @x,@xmath1 there is an admissible subset of @xxmath2 such that for any subset of the set of simple roots of the weyl group acting on the weierstrass space @x<n> , the weil group element of the corresponding perfect crystal is equal to the sum of the inverses of the weights of the coset representatives of the bru hat order on the space . in this paper , we will show that this result can be extended to the case when the space is restricted to be a finite number of copies of a given lambda path . here<n> we will recall the definition of the perfect crystal as follows : there is no finite set in the complex plane such that there is any in this paper , we introduce a new family of weighted @xmath0-fold dynamical systems , which we call _ circulant dynamical systems_. we prove that , under mild assumptions , these dynamical systems are stable with respect to perturbations .<n> in particular , the perturbations can not destroy the stability of the corresponding stable systems . as a consequence ,<n> we give a new proof of the well - known results on stability of stable dynamical systems in @xcite . <n> _ keywords : _ dynamical system , stability , stable , weight distribution _ ams 2010 subject classification _<n> primary 60k35 ;

i.e. , they can the light curves ( lls ) of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) are analyzed using monte - carlo simulations .<n> the ll is modeled by @xmath0-regression , where the parameters are : (i ) _ slope _ , _ amplitude _ and _ spectral index _ of the variable . <n> _ significance of the parameters is estimated using a robust ramsey s test . in order to explain the observed ll<n> , the following model is proposed : ( i ) the cepheids are located at the center of the disk of the galaxy , ( ii ) there is an interaction between the dark matter ( dm ) and the baryonic matter ( bm ) with a coupling constant @xcite , and ( iii ) anisotropy of the bm is caused by the interaction with the dm and/or with the baryons . the model is fitted to the following ll data set : @x<n> s@xmath1 ( _ ab _ initio ) for : [ eq2 ] the large and the small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) have been studied by means of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) cepheids and radial velocity ( rv ) profiles .<n> the data have been compared with cosmological n - body models that include cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryonic matter ( dm ) components . in order to fit the data simultaneously ,<n> models are proposed that include : _<n> i _ ) baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in the lmc ;

      "generated": "compact groups of galaxies are small systems of several galaxies in a compact configuration on the sky .<n> the first examples were found over one hundred years ago by stephan ( 1877 ) using the refractor of the observatoire de marseille , and more recently by shakhbazian ( 1957 ) and collaborators with the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) . over the next two decades , over 400 such systems<n> have been identified , with a median projected galaxy separation of only @xmath0 kpc ( the hubble constant is about 1 km s@xmath3 mpc@xcite . <n> the majority seem to be small clusters , but the majority also share some of the same questions , as do compact groups . however , interest in them is growing . recent observations of compact groups of galaxies are reviewed , with an emphasis on the properties of the individual galaxies , the galaxy spatial distribution , and the @xmath0 band luminosity function .<n> it is argued that the majority of the galaxies in compact groups are present in bound systems which are likely to be unstable to orbital decay due to gravitational relaxation processes . however , mergers play an important role in the evolution of many , if not all , galaxies . <n> the observed properties of these systems are summarized and discussed , along with methods of identification and surveys that have been made . in particular<n> , it has now become possible to understand the following observations : ( 1 ) the luminosity function of the member galaxies is well - fit by a schechter function with a characteristic mass - to - light ratio , in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations ; ( 2 ) there is no evidence for a correlation between the luminosity of the brightest galaxy in the group and the total mass of the system , although there is a hint of a correlation at small galactocentric distances ; and ( 3 ) a large fraction of the total group mass is in the form of non - visible matter , we re - examine the 100 groups of galaxies which were found by hickson s ( 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) relative - magnitude criteria and by a visual search of 67% of the sky ( all the poss prints ) , and which satisfy the following distance - dependent selection criteria : @xmath0 , where the mean surface brightness of the group calculated by distributing the flux of the member galaxies over the smallest circular area containing their geometric centers , is defined to be less than or equal to the average surface brightness in the group as a whole .<n> we find that the selection criteria lead to strong distance dependent biases in the sample . <n> geometric biases arise from the subjective nature of the search procedure ; they occur because non - spherical systems will be preferentially selected if they are oriented to present a smaller cross - sectional area ( eg. prolate systems pointed towards us ; the latter because we will preferentially select systems that , owing to galaxy orbital motion , are momentarily in a more compact state ( transient compact configurations )<n> . kinematic biases will arise from a chance alignment or transient configuration within a loose group . in order to avoid including the cores of rich clusters , an isolation criterion was necessary we have applied a friends - of - friends algorithm to a complete magnitude - limited redshift survey and identified a sample of compact groups of galaxies .<n> the groups have a median redshift of @xmath0 , a velocity dispersion of 1000 km s@xmath1 , and a median projected separation of less than 2 kpc . <n> the members of the groups are all spiral galaxies , with velocity dispersions in the range 200 to 350 km <n> s @xcite . the median projected galaxy density within the groups is about 10 times that of the mean galaxy density in the surrounding field , indicating that compact groups are not associated with loose groups , at least within the redshift range probed here . however ,<n> if the velocity distribution function is approximated by a power - law , then the median velocity dispersion is about twice that of mean galaxies in the group , suggesting that the groups contain a significant fraction of early - type galaxies and that the galaxy formation process proceeds preferentially in groups of a few thousand members each , rather than in clusters of more than a thousand members , as is the case for the general galaxy population . at a given redshift<n> , the compact groups the redshift - space , kinematics , environment , and morphological properties of the rscgs galaxies are compared to those of the hcgs . the median redshift is @xmath0 , placing most of them at distances well beyond the virgo cluster ( hickson et al 1992 ) .<n> the distribution of galaxy velocities is roughly gaussian with a peak at zero velocity , similar to velocity dispersions found in loose groups and rich clusters . however , about 25% of the total number of galaxies is seen to be projected on the group by chance . <n> a statistical analysis of large homogeneous samples indicates short dynamical times and mass - to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies in rich clusters and those in compact groups . a characteristic dynamical time<n> is found for groups containing at least 4 galaxies , with a characteristic mass density of @xxmath1 km s@xmath3 . for groups with more than 5 galaxies<n> , the characteristic time is found to be @x , which is intermediate between that of galaxies and clusters , but much shorter than dynamical times for loose groups , where the median dynamical time is about 10 gyr . in addition ,<n> the we present a study of the kinematics , shapes , spatial distribution , luminosity function , and environments of a large sample of shakhbazian compact groups ( hcgs ) .<n> the groups were selected from the catalogue of hickson et al ( 1984 ) using an automated group search algorithm . <n> the velocity distribution of the group members shows a flat component which contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies in the sample . after removing this component ,<n> a roughly gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath0 km s@xmath1 is found , with a large number of  discordant '' galaxies , some of which are not physically related to the group . the mass - to - light ratio of individual galaxies is on the order of @xxmath2 ( solar units ) in the median , suggesting that the groups are not simply projections , but are physically bound systems . in addition , the luminosity function is consistent with that of a random distribution of parent loose groups . from scaling and superimposing the groups , it is possible to estimate a characteristic dynamical time of the hcgs in the range of about 1 gyr , which is comparable to the we present a study of the properties of a sample of @xmath0 compact groups , drawn from a redshift survey of 40 loose groups .<n> the groups were selected from a sub - sample of the eso wide - field survey of the southern sky ( wdss ) , and were imaged in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) through the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) mode . <n> the selection criteria used to identify the groups include : a ) a magnitude limit , b ) redshift limit and c ) photometric redshifts . the groups span the redshift range , from 0.1 to 0.8 , with a mean redshift of 0.29 . for a completeness - check of the sample ,<n> we have also used the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , _ i.e. _ the 2mass catalog ) to obtain redshift information for the galaxies in the samples . in this way<n> , we are able to examine groups that were not previously cataloged in the literature , as well as those that are of particular interest  we have obtained h@xmath0 velocity maps for 40 galaxies in 14 of the 30 shakhbazian groups in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) .<n> this sample allows the question of the galaxy content of compact groups to be addressed with greater certainty . <n> galaxies were assigned to groups according to the observed distribution , and groups that failed to meet the hcg selection criteria were rejected . in order to avoid the selection problem ,<n> ribeiro et al ( 1994 ) obtained deeper photometry for hcg galaxies . a luminosity function for compact groups was first estimated by heiligman & turner ( 1980 ) using a sample consisting of stephan s quintet , seyfert s sextet and eight more compact groups from the arp and vorontsov - velyaminov catalogs . however , mendes de oliveira and hickson ( 1991 ) argued that the standard calculation does not address the selection effects of the hcg sample . to avoid such biases they used a modeling technique in which galaxies were drawn from a trial luminosity function and assigned to the groups . redshifts were given to each group according we compute the luminosity function of galaxies in compact groups and compare it to that of field galaxies .<n> we find that the total luminosity density of compact group galaxies is @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , and that their contribution to the total galaxian luminosity density is about twice that of cluster ellipticals . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present deep @xmath0 ccd images of the two most compact groups of galaxies known , the fornax and sextans - aurigae rich clusters of galaxies ( rscgs ) and the pleiades .<n> these images reach a limiting magnitude of m@xmath1 = 25.5 mag . <n> we have used these data to determine the structure of the groups and the kinematics of the individual galaxies . for a sample of 36 galaxies ,<n> the following parameters have been determined for each galaxy : a reddening - corrected absolute magnitude , a star formation rate ( sfr ) , and a star - formation rate - luminosity relation . the following values of the parameters are found for each group of galaxies :  ( a ) total group velocity dispersion ,  = ( 1.08@xcite / h ) = ( 0.94@xcie / h)= ( 1.02@xct ) km / s , ( b ) velocity dispersion for a single galaxy ; ( c ) disk inclination angle ; and ( d ) absolute magnitude for a galaxy within the group ; for a group of two galaxies we present a radio continuum study of the radio - selected galaxies of the iras hcg sample .<n> radio emission is detected in @xmath0 of the sample galaxies , indicating that the radio emission in these galaxies likely originates from a common region . <n> radio continuum studies of the hcg sample indicate that early - type galaxies which have a high ratio of radio - to - optical emission show an excess of nearby neighbors . in hcg<n> , this effect is similar to that found by malumian ( 1996 ) for spiral galaxies in groups , although it is not as pronounced as in rich clusters , where it has been known for many years . we find that radio - loud elliptical galaxies are preferentially first - ranked optically within a group , and that the probability of radio emission does not correlate with absolute luminosity , but instead correlates with _ relative _ luminosity within the group . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' the radio properties of a sample of 18 compact groups of galaxies are reviewed .<n> radio emission is found in only about one - third of the galaxies in the sample , and appears to be strongly correlated with the relative optical luminosity within the group . in two of the three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . <n> neutral hydrogen 21-cm line observations indicate that compact groups are deficient in neutral hydrogen by about a factor of two compared to loose groups . however , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies ( boselli et al 1996 ) indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . simulations suggest that in addition to an outflow of gas , inflow also occurs which may fuel nuclear star - formation , as suggested by the strongly - enhanced radio emission seen in the nuclear regions of compact group spiral galaxies ( menon 1995 ) . x - ray observations of hot gas in clusters of galaxies reveal the amount , distribution , temperature and metallicity of the gas , as well as the relative amount and distribution of the total gravitating mass . temperature , metallicity ( fraction of solar abundance ) , and bolometric luminosities are estimated by fitting a spectral model , such as that of raymond & smith ( 1977 ) to the data .<n> however , initial co - line observations of 15 compact - group galaxies indicated a normalized molecular gas content similar to that of isolated spiral galaxies . in two of three groups studied , the radio emission originates from a common envelope surrounding the group and in the third group there are signs of tidal distortion . <n> = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=0pt the complete x - ray catalog of the virgo cluster of galaxies ( hcg ) is used to investigate the nature of the discordant - redshift members , to estimate the contribution of hcg galaxies to the local optical luminosity density , and to estimate metal abundances .<n> the frequency of discordant redshifts in the catalog is found to be consistent with the statistics of chance projection , with a chance probability of @xmath0 , or less , of finding discordant galaxies in the sample . <n> the mean redshift of the group members is measured to be 0.023 , which corresponds to a redshift distribution in the range , 0.12 - 0.19 , typical of poor clusters , but much lower than the typical redshift in rich clusters . the mean velocity dispersion of the galaxies<n> is derived to be , within a radius of 2 , 200 km s@xmath1 . iovino & hickson ( 1996 ) combined observational results from both the hcg and scg catalogs with monte - carlo simulations . their technique exploits the unbiased nature of the scg catalog and the complete redshift coverage of the hcg sample .<n> they conclude that for all except the two highest - surface - brightness quintets ( stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet ) the number of discordant redshifts is consistent with chance projections . however , for both of these systems there is independent physical evidence that the discordant galaxies are at the cosmological distances and are therefore not group members . we discuss the evidence for and against physical association and high density in the sample of faint compact groups ( hcgs ) .<n> we show that compact groups selected on the basis of high apparent space density will be biased by the inclusion of systems which appear more compact due to geometrical or kinematic effects , and that their position in the clustering hierarchy is likely to be a strong function of space density . <n> we also show that the diffuse x - ray emission seen in many hcgs is very strong evidence that a large fraction of these systems are physically dense . although the exact numbers are not final , due to the faintness of the sources and the problems of contamination by sources associated with the individual galaxies , it seems evident that many groups are dense bound systems . we present the results of a study of the x - ray properties of galaxies in small groups selected on the basis of their compact appearance and red colors .<n> we found that in most cases the galaxies in compact groups are not brighter than @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 in the band 0.5 - 2.0 kev . <n> the fraction of blue ( gas - rich ) galaxies increases with the group s velocity dispersion , so the blue galaxies are more likely to reside in the centers of the groups than the red galaxies . in contrast , first - ranked galaxies appear to be the same as the general population of early - type galaxies , which is consistent with these systems being compact clusters or groups of galaxies of type s0 or e , and not merger products . we discuss the nature of compact groups , their end - products , and the evidence that they are in fact bound dynamical systems .<n> we then consider the formation of field elliptical galaxies from the accretion of gas - rich galaxies in small groups of galaxies . <n> @xmath0to 0pt@xmath1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present the results of a search for compact groups in the redshift range @xmath0 using the ctio 4 m telescope .<n> we have found a total of 15 compact groups with redshifts in the range : _<n> ( a ) _ hcg 31 , hcg 44 and hcg 31a ; _ ( b )<n> _ iras 23532 , a seyfert 1 and a qso , all of which are likely to be associated with compact groups . <n> we find that the comoving number density of qsos peaks at @xcite , and that there is a strong correlation between the luminosity of the qso and the size of its host group , in the sense that larger groups are more likely to contain luminous agn , while smaller groups contain agn at lower luminosities . in the case of hcg 44 ,<n> the luminosity function of the host group is consistent with that of an isolated elliptical galaxy , as is the size - luminosity correlation found for present - day elliptical galaxies , suggesting that the group is the remnant of a recent merger . if hcg 44 is a relic , then the number of relics per observed we present a study of the properties of small ( @xmath0 ) groups of galaxies as a function of redshift .<n> we find that the fraction of baryons in compact groups appears to be lower than that found for clusters of galaxies , which is consistent with the high baryon fractions found in high - redshift clusters . <n> we have calculated the number of compact groups that would be found in the field of view of the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope ( schade et al 1995 ) , if the qsos are associated with compact groups , and find that there should be a detectable number in the redshift range 0.11 . for a comoving number density of q sos per unit comoving volume of @xcite<n> , we expect to find at least 100 compact groups with masses greater than 10@xmath1 and redshifts between 0 and 1 . if the number density peaks at comoving numbers greater than this value , as is often the case , then there must be at least one qso associated with a compact group with a redshift greater than 0.1 . in this case<n> the total baryon fraction this is a review of the properties of compact groups of galaxies .<n> these regions are generally thought to be in an advanced stage of evolution characterized by strong interactions , starburst and agn activity , stripping of stellar and dark matter halos , and merging . they contain large amounts of dark matter and primordial x - ray - emitting gas trapped within the gravitational potential well . in a low - density universe<n> the infall rate is insufficient . as there is at present no other clear mechanism for avoiding overproduction of relics by merging compact groups , this may be a strong argument for a high -

type galaxies , _<n> i.e. _ , early in this paper , we present the results of a numerical simulation of a galaxy interacting with a background dark matter halo .<n> the simulated galaxy has a large velocity dispersion , a large mass in dark matter , and a large halo gas mass , all of which are in good agreement with the observational data . <n> galaxies are interacting with each other and with dark matter ( dm ) at a very high rate @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the number density of galaxies is very high , @xmath0@xmath1@xcite and , as a result , the total mass density of the universe is very large . in this simulation , _<n> i ) _ we follow the motion of the galaxy due to the gravitational potential of the dark matter and the baryonic matter of the host galaxy , due to its large mass and the large density of its dark matter component , i.e. , it is in a _ tidal field _ <n> , with a small perturbation from the background which mimics the effect of the perturbation on the galaxy in the sense that the galaxy is pushed out of the innermost part of its potential well . the galaxy we show thatstriker s effect , i.e. the relative acceleration of light to the speed of light due to the relative motion of the observer and the observer s frame , can be important in the observational determination of the hubble constant . <n> observational evidences show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .<n> however , the nature of this acceleration is not well understood . in the standard @xmath0-dominated cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ,striker<n> s effects are small , but they are important for cosmology , since they allow the cmb anisotropy to be probed at high redshifts . here<n> , we present observational data on the radial velocities of a sample of nearby galaxies , obtained by the _ uppsala _ satellite , which show that , in the cdm scenario , galaxy radial velocities are significantly larger than the local cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) value . at the same time ,<n> the radial velocity of the galaxy is indistinguishable from that of the local group , indicating that the dark matter does not significantly affect the galaxy s kinematics , at least in we present the results of a search for galactic rotation curves in the galactic plane .<n> the data were taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database . <n> we have found that the galactic rotation curve ( gpc ) is slightly flattened at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath0 ) and flattens at low latitudes . at the galactic centre ( gc ) ,<n> the rotation curve is flat , while at the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) it is slightly curved . in the northern hemisphere ( nn )<n> , the data are consistent with a flat rotation curve , whereas in the southern hemisphere ( sc ) they are slightly curved and slightly flatter than the nn data . for the local group ( lrg ) we found no evidence for rotation at the level expected from the local cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy spectrum , and for flat rotation curves we obtained an upper limit for the rotation rate of the milky way ( mw ) of @xcite , which is in agreement with the mw - astron data at the high-@xmath1 end of the galaxy  in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model , the dark matter ( dm ) dominates the mass budget of the universe , while the baryonic matter ( bm ) accounts for only a few percent of the total mass density .<n> the baryon fraction in the universe is dominated by the primordial density fluctuation , which is due to the overproduction of bm in the early universe . in this paper<n> , we study the influence of the primordial bm on the evolution of galaxies . <n> galaxies , being the most numerous component in the cosmos , play an important role in the cosmological evolution . at present , they account for about one - third of the mass density of the entire universe @xcite , but they are not sufficient to explain the present - day cosmic acceleration . the main reason for this<n> is the overabundance of low - mass galaxies ( llagns ) , i.e. , galaxies with masses smaller than about @xphys . on the other hand ,<n> the presence of galaxies in the local universe ( lmc , virgo , and the perseus cluster ) has been shown to lead to the formation we present the results of numerical simulations of galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interactions in the framework of the modified gravity theory ( mgt ) .<n> the simulations are based on the _ russian astr . <n> 6 , 199 - 201 _ and _ atlas of interacting galaxies , part ii _ , _ astron._astron.._ suppl._28:1 [ v]orontsov - velyaminov ba , dostal va , metlov vg _ soviet astron<n> . as a result of the simulations we found that the interaction of a galaxy with a dark matter halo is more efficient than the one with a stellar halo . in the simulations presented here ,<n> the interaction is caused by the gravitational attraction between the two halos , which in the case of the atlas galaxies results in the energy transfer from the halo to the galaxy .",

      "generated": "the tmt project conducted an extensive site monitoring campaign to identify the most suitable site to host the observatory . after a preselection based on satellite data and general topographic conditions ,<n> five mountain sites in northern chile , hawaii , mexico and mexico were tested for the presence and operation of extremely large telescopes .<n> the total optical turbulence strength ( tps ) was assessed by means of combined mass - dimm systems on each telescope , combined multi aperture scintillation sensor ( mass ) measurements and acoustic turbulence profilers ( sodars ) . here<n> we report on the  typical '' turbulence profiles ( tp ) obtained through these remote sensing techniques and discuss seasonal and nighttime changes and the dependence on the ground wind speed at the different altitudes . the tmt is a multi - aperture scintillation detector which will be installed on the international space station esa s forthcoming  pathfinder '' mission . during the years 2002 - 2005 , six sites of the tesla site testing were operated as mass - test sites , measuring @xmath0 , the seeing from the telescope level to the top of the atmosphere .<n> the precision of the measurements was analyzed in detail by @xcite , who reported the comparability between the mass and dimm systems to be better than 002 . however , as the robotic system operated the telescope whenever the environmental conditions did allow a safe safe operation , sometimes the dimm or mass computations failed to provide valid results . here , we treat these cases by applying the exponent on the absolute of the difference and reverting the sign of the result to obtain the ground layer seeing ( gl ) . even though negative gl values are unphysical , not taking them into account would bias the resulting statistics ; in particular the low seeing percentiles . from the difference between ground layer and mass seeings ,<n> the strength of the individual mass layers was obtained . also the isoplanatic angle<n> was obtained the tmt site testing project operated mass and dimm measurement stations at several candidate sites .<n> these measurements allowed the computation of characteristic vertical turbulence profiles ( tp ) above each of the candidate sites ( @xcite ) . here<n> , we present the statistics of the tp of the layers under particular seeing , isoplanatic angle and coherence time conditions . <n> [ firstpage ] turbulence is one of the most important physical processes in the atmosphere . in particular<n> it is responsible for the heating of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and is also thought to play a role in the formation and evolution of low - mass stars , brown dwarfs , planetary nebulae and even asteroids . as the turbulence plays a major role in all astrophysical objects , in particular the ism of our own solar system , it is important to have a good understanding of the turbulence properties above the sites of interest . to this end ,<n> the _ trans - magneto - hydrodynamic _ ( t mt ) approach has been developed , which is based on the observation of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves propagating in the magnetized atmosphere of a planet  in this study , we investigate the interaction between the mass layers of 13n on mauna kea , tolar , spm , and the northern hemisphere sites on chile .<n> the mass data were collected by the zeeman spectrograph on the apex balloon of the siberian branch of the stratospheric observatory of slovenia ( sofia ) . <n> we measured the time structure ( ts ) of the individual mass layers under particular seeing , isoplanatic angle and coherence time conditions in order to obtain an integrated turbulence profile . from these turbulence profiles ,<n> we find that the chilean sites show different integrated turbulence parameters between them , in particular the ground layer turbulence parameter ( @xmath0 ) is larger than the northern sites at altitudes above 4 km . on the other hand , the mass layer coherence time condition ( tp )<n> is similar between the three sites in chile , which is explained by the different weight put on the heighest layers in the tp calculation . in the case of tolar<n> , this means that there is no significant interaction between these layers , but the turbulence profile obtained from the overall mass data turbulence is one of the most important drivers of physical processes in the universe ( @xcite ) .<n> it is also an important driver for the evolution of the solar wind , which is responsible for @xmath0 of the total energy budget of the universe . here<n> we present the first direct measurements of turbulence on absolute scales , based on mass , mass - dimm and sodar data . <n> the sites of the northern and southern hemisphere are located in the northern hemisphere at altitude of approximately 1600 m and 2000 m , respectively , at an average altitude of about 300 m above ground . in the last years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the use of turbulence as a probe for fundamental physical processes , such as , for example , solar wind dynamos , or for the determination of the observational parameters of the sun s magnetic field . the turbulence ( tp ) field ,<n> which measures the strength of the turbulence in the atmosphere , is a key parameter for these studies . for the last few years<n> the x - ray turbulence explorer ( xfas ) has been operating in the ovi@xmath1 field of view ( fov ) @ using data from the chilean tropopause monitoring network ( tolar , armazones , cerro tolonchar , and spm ) , we present measurements of the vertical wind profiles ( tps ) above three northern hemisphere observatories .<n> the data , taken during the years 1996 to 2001 , were obtained with the sodar instrument of the european southern observatory ( eso ) and the balloon borne telescope ( gl ) of the balloon weather observatory ( bbo ) as part of an ongoing effort to monitor the optical ts in the northern hemisphere . <n> the three chilean sites are located on the summits of the candidate mountains , which we identify as candidate sites for the tmt project , as reported in @xcite . in this contribution<n> we will focus on the seasonal variability of the turbulence distribution throughout the atmosphere . to be able to validate numerical models which link meteorological observables to optical turbulence , it is essential to verify the presence of seasonal variability in the stis , especially at high altitudes , where the driving mechanism of optical turbulence is still under debate . here<n> we present the results of the computation of the standard year ( in this paper we present the results of a multi - layer analysis of the troposphere at selected sites in europe and south america .<n> the analysis is based on data from the @xmath0 network ( @xcite ) , on the lte / lte+@xmath1 network , and on reconstructed radiative / non - lte data . <n> we discuss the influence of local terrain , of large scale atmospheric conditions and of the nature of the flow on the temperature and ts behaviour at the sites . in our analysis<n> we take into account all available observational data , like temperature and humidity at the site , in the layer and in the stratosphere during the months of may , june and august . at the northern chilean sites ( tolar , tolonchar , spm , 13n )<n> we find that the temperature in the 1 km mass layer between may and august is very low during the summer months , raising to their highest values in the summermonths , whereas in the 4 km and 16 km mass layers the seasonal variation is rather smooth . above armazones<n> the behaviour is less pronounced : during may and june only weak the tmt candidates spm and 13n , located in the pacific ocean , show strong winter and weak summer turbulence ( ts ) . in chile ,<n> the two sites are known for their strong jetstream activity ( @xcite ) and strong variability of the isoplanatic angle on a timescale of a few months .<n> we use mass observations taken during the summer of 2010 at both sites and at tolonchar ( chile ) during 2011 to assess the role of the large scale wind ( lsw ) at these two sites as compared to chile . <n> we find that both sites do not show a clear seasonal trend of the turbulence strength . at the higher altitudes ( up to @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) the wind speed is the main driver for the seasonal variation of the turbulent strength at all three sites , whereas at the lower altitudes ( @.3 km asl ) only the higher wind speeds show a trend towards stronger turbulence values . for the large - scale flows , measured with the ncep / ncar reanalysis project , we find a strong correlation between the 200 mbar wind speed and the total seeing observed at telescopes the nasa s tenerife compact array ( mass ) observed three sites in northern chile ( tolonchar , mauna kea and spm ) during the summer of 2010 .<n> the three sites were chosen for their excellent total seeing conditions , their proximity to the pacific ocean and the availability of meteorological data ( e.g. , wind speed and temperature ) . here , we present the results of our study of the mean wind speed , the wind speed distribution and the turbulence strength as a function of altitude . we find that the median ts at all three sites increases with altitude , but at different rates . above the chilean mountains , where atmospheric waves are expected to be enhanced due to differential heating patterns ,<n> the turbulence is only about half of what is observed at the northern sites . on the other hand , for wind speeds above @xmath0m@xmath1 , which is the level at which atmospheric waves can be expected to form , all three mass layers show a trend towards stronger turbulence . <n> the atmospheric turbulence ( ar ) is one of the most important factors in determining the morphology of space weather patterns . in the turbulent fluxes in the pacific ocean are thought to be driven by differential heating patterns like the proximity of the atacama desert to the ocean .<n> atmospheric waves are commonly thought to result in an increased turbulence cross section ( ts ) . however , such waves and their turbulence production can not yet be modeled properly , even though comparisons between models and observations show promising results ( e.g. , @xcite . here , we present the results of an observational study in which we measured the night s evolution of the turbulence cross sections in the mediterranean and pacific ocean during night time . <n> the observations were collected during the summer of 2010 at the sites of tolar , 13n , armazones , and spm in california , as well as at the site of tolonchar , on the island of la palma , in the canary islands . to compute the richardson number and any other stability parameter ,<n> the temperature and wind speed measured at each site were assumed to be related to their respective gradients throughout the air above the site . from these observations we suspect that cooling of the terrain during the night is important for the decrease of the in this letter we present the turbulence measurements of the mass - dimm defined atmospheric boundary layer ( gl ) at six continental sites , namely , 13n , tolar , armazone , spm , chilean sites and 13n mauna kea .<n> the turbulence production is dominated by the interaction between air and ground ( @xcite ) , i.e. , the gl is the layer in which turbulence production , mainly due to the shear of the flow , is driven . here<n> we show that the gl turbulence measurements are correlated to the wind speed which was measured 2 m above ground by the automated weather stations , which were equipped with cup anemometers of type an3 by monitor sensors . at all sites<n> the gl shows the lowest @xmath0 values in the range of wind speeds between approximately 2 m / s and 8 m /<n> s . for continental sites<n> is the behaviour at a higher level , as was already seen in the overall profiles . in particular<n> the constant ts at arma zone is attributed to its proximity to the pacific ocean . <n> site testing is an important tool to determine the suitability of sites mass , dimm , sodar and sodar based measurements of @xmath0 at the candidate sites of the trans - pacific stratospheric flight experiment ( tmt ) are presented .<n> these techniques have a good accuracy to measure the integrated turbulence parameters . at all sites<n> the turbulence strength of the lowest 500 m the ground layer is found to be the dominating contributor to the overall seeing . on the other hand , 13n and spm show lower turbulence strengths at higher altitudes , resulting in a weaker mass seeing than at the chilean sites . <n> the mass and the sodar measurements , even though these cover much less time than the mass observations , support this finding . they indicate that the altitude dependence of the total seeing at 13n , s pm and the chilen sites between approximately 60 m and 100 m above the ground is steeper than in the chileans , which results in a stronger total seeing below this altitude at the northern sites as compared to the chiles . the average profiles explain the origin of the observed behaviour of the turbulence parameters as well as of the integrated turbulent profiles . [ [ section ] ] the search for stratospheric flight experiments ( sspes  this paper presents the first results from the optical turbulence profiler ( mass ) site search for candidate sites for the transition membrane telescope ( tmt ) .<n> the mass observations were collected at the chilean sites during the summer of 2006 . at all sites<n> the turbulence strength of the lowest 500 m layer is found to be the dominating contributor to the overall seeing . the isoplanatic angle differences between the sites<n> depend on the distribution of the high altitude turbulence . in this respect , spm shows similar high altitude turbulent strengths as the chilen sites and therefore a similar iso planatic angle , despite its mass seeing being comparable to 13n . seasonal and nocturnal variations of the median turbulence strength recorded by the mass have also been shown . these data indicate that the resolution of the mass is in the order of a few @xmath0 m@xmath1 . clear seasonal variations are observed up to 2 km and at 8 km above the sites . we report on the detection of optical turbulence at the candidate sites of the test particle telescope ( tmt ) , in situ at calar alto , ontario , canada .<n> the optical turbulence was detected using adaptive optics ( ao ) with a spatial resolution of @xmath0 and temporal resolution of 10 s. the detection was made at a time when the mean optical turbulence is expected to be at its minimum , and the ao imaging technique was used to measure the time constants of the light travel time across the turbulence . <n> optical turbulence ( o turbulence ) is one of the most challenging phenomena to detect in the optical range of wavelengths , due to the high turbulence speeds and the short time scales involved . in recent years<n> , a number of experiments have been carried out to detect optical turbulence in the atmosphere , at ground - based observatories and in the laboratory @xcite , as well as in the field of astrophysical interest , such as the search for planets orbiting the sun , the characterization of gravitational wave background radiation for gravitational wave detectors , searches for exoplanets orbiting the solar system , etc . over the past two decades , there has been the boundary layer ( bl ) plays an important role in determining the location of astronomical observatories .<n> it is an important component of adaptive optics ( ao ) systems , which are used to measure isoplanatic angles and time constants . here<n> , we propose a new approach to location of ao sites , based on the concept of  isothermality '' , defined as the ability of a system to compensate for the non - uniform distribution of temperature and humidity in the ao region . <n> adaptive optics is a technology that allows one to measure the position of a point source with sub - arcsecond accuracy by using adaptive optics and an optical system that adaptively perturbs the light field at the point source . in recent years , a number of new ao systems have been proposed @xcite , such as the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wfio ) @xmath0 , as well as ground - based facilities such as sdo , jwst and navarro , frenk we present the crrrrrrrrrrr site names , longitudes , and heights for the cerro tolar ( mass -

corrected profiles to properly account for egret effects . we present the results of a search for ultra - short gamma - ray bursts ( @xmath0s@xmath1 ) with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) .<n> we have identified a total of 14 short - duration events with durations ranging from 2 to 8 hours . from these events , we have determined that the fraction of energy radiated in the form of gamma rays is between 25% and 75% , depending on the event , and that the total amount of energy released in the event is in the range of @x erg / s . <n> the event durations range from 3 to 12 hours , with an average value of 8 hours for the short events . using these data ,<n> we find that the average fraction of kinetic energy dissipated in gamma -

mass binaries ( llb ) . in the case of llbs<n> , the masses range from 3mev to 10mev and the luminosities are found to be in the sub - eddington range . <n> epsf gamma - rays : observations epsf ism : jets and outflows we present the results of a search for ultrarelativistic electron -

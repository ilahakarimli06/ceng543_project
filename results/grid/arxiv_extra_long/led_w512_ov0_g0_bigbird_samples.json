dependent driving force .<n> the driving force is assumed to be an external force acting on the whole system , which includes the oscillator itself . in the weak driving regime<n> we find that the particle is trapped in a metastable state , characterized by a finite average free path . for stronger driving the particle<n> is released from this trapped state and moves freely within the oscillator . <n> pacs numbers : : 03.65.-w , 03.67.-a , 05.45.mt the study of the quantum dynamics of many -

well potential , where the influence of the environment can be easily taken into account , e.g. we study the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a metallic and a semiconducting phase of the @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice .<n> we use a non - perturbative renormalization group approach , and find that the transition is first - order , with a critical temperature @xcite . in the metallic phase , we find a finite critical value of the coupling constant , below which the system undergoes a second - order phase transition . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of quantum phase transitions in a number of different systems , both classical and quantum . for a given system ,<n> a phase transition is characterized by a change in the value of its order parameter , which can be quantified by the critical temperature . on the other hand , in the quantum regime , the transition can be continuous , or discontinuous , depending on the parameters of the system . here<n> we consider the case of a 2d square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field , for which the order parameter undergoes a continuous phase transition as a function of the field . using the density - matrix renormal in this letter , we study the transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the transversely and longitudinally polarized light from the 1st and 2nd @xmath0skips of su(n)@xmath1u(1 ) at a transversely polarized target in the framework of the su(3 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) .<n> we find that the polarization of the light from bothskips is significantly larger than that of the secondskip , due to the interference between the two polarizations . we present the results of a study of the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) in carbon nanotube ( cnt ) bundles .<n> the cnt bundles are made of two different materials , graphite ( c@xmath0n ) and graphite nanofibers ( gnfs ) , which exhibit very different electrical properties . in the case of graphite ,<n> the electrical conductivity of the cnts is very high , up to @xmath1 , while the gnf conductivity is lower , down to a few tenths of a percent , due to the very low temperature of the nanotube . <n> the transport properties of cnts are very sensitive to temperature , especially in the early phase of growth , when the temperature is low , and the electrical conductance ( ec ) is very small . as a result , the ec is a sensitive probe of the temperature of cnt early in its growth process . for cnts made of different materials<n> , we find that the electrical ec of the carbon nanotubes depends strongly on the ratio of the tube thickness to the thermal wavelength . we show that this result can be understood in terms of the interplay we present a new method for the determination of the orientation of the sun with respect to the observer s line of sight .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the two -

rays sources and their surrounding matter , especially in the context of the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) and intra - cluster medium ( icm )<n> . however , most of the studies have been restricted to the case of pure prograde sources . in this study ,<n> we investigate in detail the interaction of light elements with their surrounding medium , in particular , with the ism and icm in some compact and ultracompact ugc , and in a few compact , prograde and very compact ugcs . from the analysis of the distribution of the angular momenta of the light element s primaries<n> , it is found that a large fraction of these objects are probably in a mixed state , i.e. , they are in a state where both the light we present the results of a detailed study of the stellar dynamics of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , based on high - resolution n - body / sph simulations .<n> we find that , even in the most extreme cases , the dynamics of these systems can be very complex , and often lead to multi - stage clustering of the x - rays emitted by the nuclei , accompanied by the emission of a large amount of relativistic and gravitational radiation . in the light of these results<n> , we discuss the origin of the observed clustering and present an alternative interpretation of the clustering based on the orbital motion of the compact objects . <n> recently , a number of studies have been devoted to the investigation of the emission and absorption of radiation from compact objects ( cecs ) based on _ ab initio _ calculations . among these studies ,<n> i would like to emphasize the role played by the _ self - consistent _ model ( sccm ) @xcite , which has been widely used to describe the emission from extragalactic sources , especially in the context of the galactic centre ( gc ) emission . within this model , <n> the in this paper we present the results of our analysis of the interpulse motion of @xmath0 objects detected by the _ pspc _<n> ( south ) and _ swift _ ( north ) interpulse surveys .<n> we find that the mean interpulse speed increases with the distance from the centre , indicating that the arms of the objects detected in the two surveys follow the same pattern . in the case of ugc 11226<n> , we find evidence for two or more arms , while in ngc 6611 and ugca , only one or two arms are detected in each survey . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] we study the interaction of stellar streams with the circumstellar material of the host galaxies .<n> we find that the stream - stream interaction can lead to a significant modification of the structure of the galaxies , especially for the low - mass stars . as a result ,<n> the total luminosity of the galaxy becomes very sensitive to the amount of circumstellar matter , which can be used to estimate the star formation rate in the host galaxy . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] we report on the detection of a new type of gravitational wave , the so - called _ multiple _ gravitational wave ( mgw ) .<n> we find that the spectrum of the gravitational wave produced by a pair of counter - rotating black holes ( bhs ) is very broad , with a maximum frequency of @xmath0 hz , and is dominated by the contribution from multiple arms . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of gravitational waves produced by binary systems consisting of a central black hole ( bh ) and a companion star . in such systems ,<n> the interaction of the two bhs with the surrounding medium can produce gravitational waves , which are known as gravitational waves ( gw ) or gravitational wavepackets ( grps ) in the literature . the gw - grp interaction is characterized by a high frequency , a large separation between the components of the binary system , as well as a high amplitude of the emitted gravitational wave signal . for a system composed of a bh and its companion<n> , grps can be produced in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) when the in this paper , we present the results of numerical simulations of stellar dynamics in a compact binary system .<n> the system consists of a @xmath0 star and its central compact object , which is assumed to be a massive star , in the early stage of the merger of the two compact objects . in the simulations ,<n> we follow the evolution of the system from the pre - merger stage to the final merger stage . during the merger process , the central object undergoes mass transfer from the binary system to its parent star . due to the large amount of mass transferred , a large fraction of the stars in the system will be accreted onto the central star during the process . as a result , most of the accreting stars will be lost from the system during the course of the process and the remaining stars will end up as white dwarfs or neutron stars . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of stellar evolution in binary systems , especially in the context of the formation and evolution of white dwarf stars , neutron stars and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic nuclei . @xcite in the previous work , refs.@xcite we present the results of a study of the circumstellar material of a sample of ultracompact x - ray binaries ( uc xrbs ) .<n> we found that the mass of circumstellar matter within the effective radius of the host galaxies ranges from 10@xmath0 to @xmath1 . within this range ,<n> the mass - to - light ratios of the stellar components are generally in good agreement with the values obtained from the integrated light measurements of the parent galaxies . <n> the present study is motivated by the recent discovery of compact extragalactic objects , which are generally believed to be ultracompact ( uchii ) systems . in these systems<n> , the mass distribution of the stars can be very broad , and the star - formation activity can be quite intense . as a result , a large amount of material is expected to be produced in the process of star formation . however , most of these objects are found to be compact , making it difficult to determine the origin of this material . here<n> we report on a detailed investigation of the properties of a small sample of ugc xrb systems , for which we have obtained accurate mass distributions of their stars within the uchi we present the results of a survey of high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) supernovae ( sne ) in the small magellanic cloud .<n> we find that the rate of decline of the fraction of sn with x - ray luminosities is much faster in more slowly accreting systems , which suggests that the sn rate may be overestimated in these systems . as a result ,<n> the predicted fraction of high-@xmath1 sn is much lower than the observed value . <n> the results presented here are based on the analysis of data obtained in the sloan digital sky survey , for which we have used the chandrasekhar - fermi method for the calculation of the electron distribution function , and the _ rosat _ all - sky survey for the determination of the optical depth and extinction . in this contribution<n> , we report the results from a survey for high- , intermediate- and low -

type seyfert galaxies with the aim of searching for extended x - rays from the centres of these galaxies .<n> we find that the emission is generally dominated by the thermal radiation of the central black holes , which dominates the emission in most cases . however , in a small fraction of cases ( @xmath0 per cent ) , the contribution from the extended black holes can be as important as that from the central bhs . in the majority of cases ,<n> the extended emission is found to be dominated by a hard spectrum , with a temperature of about 2 kev , and a luminosity of about 10 erg s@xmath1 . we present the results of a survey of extragalactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with the _ swift_/xrt .<n> the survey covers a total area of @xmath0 deg@xmath1 , of which at least half is covered by objects with known redshifts . <n> we find that the fraction of binaries which contain at least one o star increases with increasing distance from the galactic centre . in most cases , however , the fraction is high enough to allow determination of the o star s redshift , which in turn is used to estimate the mass of the xrb . for a large number of objects ,<n> we have determined the redshift with which the object falls into one of the above categories , and found that a large fraction of them are located in objects with o star masses in the range of 10 - 100 . from these results , we conclude that the majority of objects have o stars as their progenitors and that o star mergers play an important role in the evolution of these objects . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' <n> epsf.sty x -

range coulomb interactions .<n> we show analytically that the model has a phase separation into a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we prove the existence of phase separation in finite systems . <n> the spin chain model @xmath0 is a simple example of a system with _ _ asymmetric _ interactions : the spins interact with each other through a long - ranged coulombic potential which is _ not _ symmetric about the origin of the interaction . in the ferromagnetic phase of the model , the spins are aligned along the direction of the external magnetic field @xcite , while in the paramagnetic case , they are aligned perpendicular to the field . for a system of spinless fermions<n> , it has been shown that there is a zero - temperature phase transition between the ferromagnet and the paramagnet , and that this phase transition is of second order in the limit of vanishing inter - spin interaction , where the spin system is described _ exactly _ by the _ exact _ path integral hamiltonian . here , we show that the we consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 particles with cyclic symmetry .<n> this system may be viewed as a model of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with cyclic interactions . using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques ,<n> we show that the bec undergoes a first - order transition to a topological phase when the number of particles is increased beyond a critical value . <n> the study of phase transitions is one of the central problems in condensed matter physics @xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand how phase transitions may take place in systems with symmetries , such as a bec or a honeycomb lattice , and under conditions where the symmetry of the underlying hamiltonian is spontaneously broken . to this end<n> it is useful to consider cyclic hamiltonians ( lhss ) , in which a system of coupled oscillators is described by a cyclic ( dirac ) equation . here<n> we consider cyclic models of two - component condensates , where the degrees of freedom are the same as in a dirac equation , but where the oscillators are allowed to have any number of nearest - neighbor interactions , for example  we introduce a new class of interacting particle systems in which excited states correspond to local minima of the energy .<n> we show that this model exhibits a rich phenomenology , including excited states with a set of metastable states , phase separation and chiral symmetry breaking . using a combination of numerical and analytical methods ,<n> we evaluate the partition sum and some correlation functions associated with the model . in recent years<n> , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of interacting many -

neighbor ( nn ) interactions .<n> we assume that the nn interactions are attractive and that the interaction strength is such that each spin is coupled to its nearest neighbors only . in the absence of an external magnetic field ,<n> the model reduces to a one -

temperature superconductivity , due to the possibility of tuning the interaction strength between the two halves of the lattice by changing the number of particles in the lattice . at the same time we show that the ground state properties of a one - dimensional fermi gas with nearest - neighbor interactions and attractive interactions are determined by the partition sum of the system .<n> we analytically calculate this partition sum for any number of particles , interactions and interaction strengths , and show that it has a power - law dependence on the interaction strength , with an exponent @xmath0 for large interactions . for repulsive interactions ,<n> the power law is independent of the particle - particle interaction , but dependent on the strength of the interaction . <n> _ introduction _ one of the most important questions in the study of quantum many -

field version of the ordering dynamics in a one - dimensional toy model .<n> the model consists of @xmath0 domains , of which one is long and the other is short . in the scaling limit , the model reduces to the scalar model studied by derrida _ et al . _<n> [ phys . rev . lett . * 84 * , 2993 ( 2000 ) ] , in which all species order at the same time . we find that the mean field model exhibits a non - trivial scaling behavior in the vicinity of the transition from the long - species to the short - species ordered state . at the transition ,<n> the particle number in the long domain is proportional to the number of its nearest neighbors , while in the short domain it is a power - law function of the length of the shortest domain , with an exponent which is independent of the system s dimensionality and of the strength of the coupling between the domains . the order - disorder transition ( eso ) @xcite is a crossover from a disordered to an ordered state as a function of a dimensionless parameter , such as dimensionality or coupling between domains @x we study a mean - field model of a two - component gas of non - interacting fermions in one dimension .<n> the model consists of a particle of type @xmath0 which interacts with the other particle of the same type through a repulsive contact force . in the thermodynamic limit<n> we calculate the partition function , the correlation function and the steady - state correlation function . <n> pacs numbers : 05.50.+q , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn 2 recently a model has been proposed @xcite for the study of a system of fermionic atoms interacting via a repulsive force , in which the interaction is mediated by a repulsive interaction between the particle in the center of mass of the system and the other fermion in the surrounding medium . according to this model , _<n> e.g. _ , if the distance between two particles is less than a critical value , their interaction will be repulsive and the system will be in a low - density phase . here , we study this model using numerical simulations of the toy model . we find that the model is equivalent to a one - dimensional three - species gas , where the interaction between particles is mediated we introduce a generalized lattice model in which the different species of particles are treated as tensors .<n> the steady - state weight is constructed from a product of tensors each corresponding to a particle located in a specific place on the lattice . <n> the model is used to study the scaling of the correlation function near the critical point ( infinite temperature ) , where the typical domain wall width diverges , and the scaling exponents are obtained to be @xmath0 , @xcite . in the last decade<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the properties of strongly correlated many - body systems , both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium . among the most important examples<n> is the strongly correlated fermi liquid , which is composed of bosons and fermions , separated by a critical point . at low temperatures ,<n> the behavior of the system is described by the ising universality class , while at high temperatures the behavior is that of a simple fermion model , _<n> i.e. _ the hubbard model . the latter model has been extensively studied in the context of high temperature superconductivity , but it has not been considered in the study of strongly we investigate the effect of stochastic perturbations on the steady - state properties of a one - dimensional stochastic binary mixture of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles .<n> the particles interact only through particle - particle collisions , but may also interact with each other . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we show that the steady state is characterized by the presence or absence of long - range correlations between the particles in the binary mixture . <n> the study of stochastic binary mixtures ( sbms ) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider a system consisting of two classes of particles , each interacting with particles in a binary mixture ( hbm ) . for this system<n> it has been shown that the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of the particles is a non - monotonic function of the particle density , @xmath0 , and that there is a critical particle density below which the system is in an uncorrelated pure state . as a result , the system undergoes a phase transition from a pure state to a correlated state as the density of particles in each binary mixture is increased . we present a method to obtain the ground state energy of a quantum many - body system in the canonical ensemble .<n> the method is based on the use of a tensor ansatz for the partition function , which allows us to treat systems with both periodic boundary conditions and unequal number of particles . in the case of a periodic boundary condition<n> we show that the ground - state energy is given by @xmath0 , while in the general case we find a non - trivial expression for the energy which depends on the size of the vector - spaces . for a system with an even number of fermions<n> we find that the tensor product of the tensor products of the partition functions is always zero . <n> it is well known that a quantum system with a large number of interacting particles can be in a ground state @xcite . however , it is not always possible to find the exact ground state of a large many - particle system . to solve this problem<n> one usually has to solve a schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian . here<n> we will show that it is possible to derive an exact solution for a large class of many - fermion systems , using a tensor product approach , where the tensor we derive a tensor ansatz for the ground state correlation function of the hubbard model , and use it to derive a set of recursion relations for a variety of correlation functions .<n> these recursion relations are solved numerically for finite systems to show that all correlation functions converge to the same limit as the system size is increased . <n> tensors have proven to be a powerful tool in the study of many - body quantum systems . in quantum field theory<n> the use of tensors allows for the calculation of ground state properties such as energy and magnetization @xcite . however , in the field of ultracold atoms , where tensors are typically not available , it is often necessary to resort to approximations such as the gaussian random phase approximation ( gga ) @xmath0 @x , or the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xmath1 method , which is more numerically and analytically tractable than the tensor based method . here , we present a tensor - based method for calculating correlation functions of interacting bosons in the gga using a recursion relation for the correlation function . using this method<n> , one can calculate ground state energies and magnetisations of interacting we argue for the existence of phase separation in a system of particles with four species .<n> the argument is based on a set of recursion relations which relate the evolution of the system to the exchange of particles between nearest neighbors . using these recursion relations<n> we have calculated the correlation function which is a measure of the phase separation , for various system sizes . in the disordered case , @xmath0 , we find a critical point which is characterized by a scaling variable which is the ratio between the domain size and the domain wall width . <n> we then discuss possible generalization of the model to four species and argue that the system also phase separates . 2 the study of phase transitions is one of the central problems in statistical mechanics . at the core of this problem<n> is the question of the nature of phase transition in a closed system of interacting many - body systems . for a system consisting of a finite number of species ,<n> a phase transition is one in which the number of particles in the system tends to infinity as the system size tends to zero @xcite . on the other hand , in the context of statistical mechanics one is often interested in the phase transition between different types of ordered states , e.g.  the coarsening dynamics of a system composed of three species of self - propelled spherical particles is considered .<n> it is shown that for some choices of transition rates several metastable states composed of the minimum number of domains ( _ i.e. _ , states where only stable domains are present ) may become metastable . the relative stability ( and thus the resulting phase separated state )<n> may be found by determining the relaxation time of these states using simple considerations such as those presented in section ii . as is the case of @xmath0 detailed balance , the condition for this detailed balance is found to be satisfied for certain densities and transition rates . <n> the coarse - grained description of complex systems is an important topic in theoretical physics as well as in applications such as phase separation @xcite . in this context ,<n> the problem of phase separation is particularly interesting since it is the simplest , yet non - trivial , example of phase transition , where the final state of the system is determined by the dynamics of the individual components . despite the fact that phase separation has been studied for a long time , it is only recently that it has been considered from the point of view of a model system  a model of three species of particles diffusing on a ring previously introduced in @xcite has been studied .<n> the model is governed by local dynamics in which all moves compatible with the conservation of the three densities are allowed . in the special case of equal densities we find that the steady state generated by the local stochastic dynamics is exactly given by a long - range asymmetric hamiltonian . phase separation for this case is explicitly demonstrated . although we did not succeed in solving the case of non - equal densities of particles , there is a strong evidence that phase separation still occurs . the model provides an explicit example for the mechanism leading to phase separation or breaking of ergodicity in systems with _ local _ stochastic dynamics . we study a mean - field model of a one - dimensional array of point - like particles with nearest - neighbor interactions .<n> we show that the model exhibits a first - order phase transition from a high - density phase to a low - density , long - range ordered phase . <n> the study of phase transitions is an important topic in physics , chemistry , and biology . in this context , it is important to understand the nature of the phase transition , especially in the low - dimensional case , which is difficult to study analytically . here<n> we consider a simple model of an array of particles in one dimension , where each particle consists of an interacting pair of point particles . using a combination of numerical and analytical methods<n> we study the transition from an ordered high density phase , in which the particles form long , narrow domains , to a disordered low density phase in the large - time limit . *<n> introduction : * one of the simplest models of a disordered array of interacting point particles is given by @xcite : in this model the particles are arranged in a box of size @xmath0 , with each particle in the box interacting with at most two other particles of the box . we present a general framework for the analysis of the dynamics of interacting many - body quantum systems , based on the concept of translationally invariant weights .<n> this allows us to prove detailed balance , which is a central result in the study of the equilibrium properties of many - particle systems . as an application<n> , we derive the domain size distribution for a class of one - dimensional interacting quantum spin systems with nearest - neighbor interactions . <n> quantum systems often exhibit a rich variety of complex dynamical behavior , including non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite , and the emergence of macroscopic order from microscopic or macroscopic initial conditions . in many physical situations<n> the evolution of a quantum system can be characterized in terms of the state of the system s elementary constituents . for a system with only a finite number of elementary particles ,<n> this is known as the elementary particle ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) problem . on the other hand , in systems with more than two elementary particles<n> the eigenvalue problem is more difficult to analyze . here<n> we consider a model of many particles interacting via a random sequential exchange dynamics , with an emphasis on the problem of detailed balance ( _ i. we consider the statistical mechanics of a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators .<n> the coupling between the oscillators is described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation , which is solved exactly in the limit of high frequencies and low damping . in this limit<n> , the system is known to exhibit translational invariance , but detailed balance can not be established . here , we show that detailed balance is satisfied for all values of the damping parameter , provided that the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak . <n> pacs numbers : : 45.70.vn , 45.50.tt , 87.10.+e in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of non -

dimensional schrdinger equation ( @xmath0xe ) , which can be solved exactly . in this limit<n> , the perturbed ho system can be mapped onto a perturbed hamiltonian system of second - order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) with a perturbed harmonic oscillator term . for small coupling<n> constants , we find that the perturbed system undergoes a phase transition from a harmonic oscillator - like state to a non - oscillatory state . <n> the classical theory of harmonic oscillators ( hos ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) has been very successful in describing a wide variety of physical systems , including atomic nuclei , stars , planets , and planets themselves , as well as astrophysical objects such as asteroids and stellar cores . as a result ,<n> hos have been used to model a wide range of phenomena in physics and engineering , such as the motion of stars and planets in the earth s gravitational field , electromagnetic waves we present an exact solution of the einstein -

zero topological charge . <n> the quantum theory of gravity has a long history , going back to einstein , maxwell and dirac @xcite . in the standard action<n> it is assumed that the field is homogeneous and isotropic , so that there is no interaction between the degrees of freedom . for massive scalar fields ,<n> however , the action is assumed to be non - homogeneous , with an interaction of the form @xmath0 , where the coupling constants are determined by the mass of the scalar field . as a result<n> , there is an infinite hierarchy of couplings , depending on the masses of the fermions in the theory . at low energies<n> the theory reduces to the maxwell equations , while at high energies the action perturbations are known as maxwell s equations ( see e.g. refs . we study the classical and quantum properties of a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms confined in an optical trap .<n> the trap is modelled by a radially symmetric potential which is scaled according to the strength of the atomic dipole - dipole interaction . in the classical limit<n> we find that the condensate undergoes a second - order phase transition to a superfluid , and that the critical exponents of the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition depend on the orientation of the trap relative to the atomic orbitals . <n> quantum fluctuations are important in determining the critical properties of many quantum systems , such as superconductors @xcite , superfluid helium-3 @x , bose condensates ( becs ) @x<n> . however , the nature of the quantum phase transition in these systems is still an open question . to this end<n> , it is important to determine the phase diagram of the system , in particular to identify the regions in the parameter space where the transition is first -

421 @xcite . in this paper , we present results from observations with alma and sma of the two brightest sources in the alma bandpass , s gr a * ( j17543 - 5937 , j1755 - 5954 , mrk 486 , nrao 664 ) with @ x sgr a * is the brightest known extragalactic radio source , with a peak luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , and is detected over a wide range of frequencies .<n> it is known to vary by more than an order of magnitude on timescales of days to weeks . here<n> we report on the highest frequency detection of this source to date , using the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( sma ) . at 230 ghz ,<n> the measured flux density is in the range 230 to 341 ghz with a mean frequency of 341 to 355 ghz and a fractional rms variability of 5 to 14 percent . <n> the sma observations were performed in a mode in which the array was tuned to one of the three main sma bands ( 1.3 mm , 1.1 mm and 870 micron ) and were  piggy backed '' by observations of the nearby blazar , j1733 - 130 . in most cases , these data were obtained during short , self - contained observation sets , which alternated with those of the relatively nearby source and were bookended with observations of a flux standard ( typically neptune  the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is one of the most active regions of star formation in the universe , with more than 100 active sites of young stellar objects ( ysos ) within its borders .<n> one of these active sites , sagittarius a * , is a well - studied , rotationally - dominated co - emitting yso , which has been well studied both observationally and theoretically . using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , we monitored sgr a * for several months in order to track the flux density of this active yso on sub - milliarcsecond ( mas ) scales . we found that the mean spectrum from sma data is consistent with that from alma , vla , and the _ herschel space observatory _ ( _ hst _ ) over a wide range of flux density scales , from 10@xmath0 to @xmath1 mjy . over the same range ,<n> the visibility data from the sma indicate that the flux from the active site , as well as diffuse emission from the surrounding warm dust , varies on timescales of a few to a few years . we report new observations of sgr a * using the very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .<n> the vla data have a mean spectral index of @xmath0 between 40 and 218 ghz , which is consistent with a flat or slightly declining power - law spectrum above 230 ghz as seen previously . at 40 ghz and below ,<n> the spectral index is steeper and the variability is stronger than at radio wavelengths . the alma data have mean spectral indices between 217 and 355 ghz of @ x@xmath1 between epochs from -0.4 to + 0.1 , with a mean of -0.13 . <n> the near - infrared ( nir ) mean flux density and spectral index are consistent with synchrotron emission from a relativistic thermal maxwell - juttner distribution . for the first time , we have observed the full synchrotron spectrum of an extragalactic radio source at wavelengths shorter than 1 mm , including the short - wavelength part of the spectrum where the emission is dominated by the thermal component of the radiation field . we find that the nir spectral index steepens at short wavelengths , similar to what has been seen we present new observations of sgr a * at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths , as well as in the infrared band .<n> these observations were carried out as part of a multi - frequency campaign to study the variability and spectral properties of the low - mass x - ray binary system . using the submillimeter array ( sma ) at @xmath0 ghz , we observed the source simultaneously in the millimeter and infrared bands . in the near - infrared ( nir ) band ,<n> we also obtained simultaneous observations with the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) , which provided nir data at the same spectral resolution as the millimeter data . by combining these data with earlier nir and radio data , and by assuming stationary statistics for the source between the early observations and these new observations , <n> we show that there is no evidence for spectral curvature or greater steepening in the spectrum between 230 and 690 ghz and that the source must be composed of stratified regions near the optically thick - to - thin transition in order to produce a near - flat synchrotron spectrum over this broad frequency range . above 350 ghz<n> , the millimeter spectrum can be explained in the context of the classical jet the spectrum of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy , sgr a * , was observed by the atacama large millimetre / submillimeter array ( alma ) in the @xmath0 kev band during the fall of 2008 .<n> the spectrum is dominated by emission from the bow shock region of the accretion flow onto the black hole , and can be fit self - consistently with a two - temperature model : a thermal plasma and a nonthermal population of electrons and positrons . in this paper<n> , we present the alma spectrum , along with the ir and x - ray data from the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) and _ swift _ ( xmm - newton ) , as well as the first ir spectrum from the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) during the commissioning of the herschel space observatory ( hsto ) telescope . <n> the alma data are consistent with a plasma with a temperature of a few@xmath1 k in the alma band , with a peak in the self - absorbed spectrum extending to a few tens of kev . however , we report the results of a two - year vla experiment to measure the radio synchrotron emission from the bow shock in the accretion flow around g2 .<n> the data were collected between october 2012 and may 2014 . in the first epochs of the experiment ,<n> the 1.5 ghz excess flux density was @xmath0 jy , a value expected from a simple power - law fit to the average at 1.0 ghz . over the course of the two years of observations , however , the flux density excess did not change by more than 2% , and there is no evidence that the timescale for the shock to change is secular . at frequencies above 5 ghz<n> , intrinsic variability rises rapidly and is likely to occur on a timescale of a few months . between october<n> 2012 and might 2014 , there was no significant secular change in the 1.5 and 3.1 ghz flux density measurements , but there was a 2% change at 5.4 ghz between the first and last epoch of this experiment . from october 2012 to may 2014 there was only a 2% variation in the l band flux density , at most 12 mjy ( 2% ) . by the end of our experiment in may 2014<n> the l we present new , high - sensitivity radio continuum observations of g2 in the low - mass x - ray binary cygnus x-1 , obtained with the very large array ( vla ) .<n> the observations cover 15 epochs , from 2013 august 08 to 2013 september 18 , at frequencies 1 , 3 , and 40.9 ghz . <n> cyg x-1 is the lowest - mass ( @xmath0 ) stellar - mass black hole known and is thought to be accreting from the center of its host star @xcite . in 2013 , it underwent a major accretion event , becoming the first black hole to be captured and ejecting a stream of material into the path of the parent star s motion . over the next several years , cyg<n> x-1 underwent a series of large - amplitude , highly - structured outbursts at radio frequencies between 1 and 40 ghz that were initially attributed to a bow shock driven by the accretion flow . here , we report the results of our new observations , which significantly extend the range of radio flux densities over which these outbursts have been observed . the new observations also reveal a new source of variability at 1 ghz with we present measurements of the flux density of sgr a * at band 6 ( 230 ghz ) , band 7 ( 345 , 690 , and 21 ghz respectively ) and historical data from the submillimeter array ( sma ) at band 7 and 345 ghz with dates from 2001 through 2012 .<n> we also present results from alma and sma observations with similar timescales . using this data<n> , we measure the mean flux density to be @xmath0 jy , a result that is consistent with typical low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) variability levels . a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that our results are consistent with originating from the same distribution as @xcite . we present new observations of sgr a * over the course of the periastron passage of g2 .<n> these observations include new vla , alma , and sma measurements near 220 ghz and band 7 and 345 ghz measurements . in the case of low - frequency emission , the absence of significant change permits us to constrain the size of the ensuing bow shock to be a factor of 30 smaller than the apparent g2 size observed with nir wavelengths at larger distances from the black hole @xcite . the smaller bow shock size is consistent with both cloud and stellar - wind models . @cite propose a model that may reconcile the apparently discrepant nir continuum and spectroscopic observations and may also be consistent with our observations . we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with the tidal disruption of g2 in sgr a * , the prototype low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) .<n> our upper limit to the distance to the bow shock is @xmath0 , much closer than the estimated distance to g2 from the nearest seyfert galaxy , ngc 6240 . <n> the lack of any enhanced short wavelength radio and millimeter emission from the black hole is also consistent with a compact size for g2 . simulations have shown that more extended objects are more readily disrupted and would therefore be more likely to have some gas initiate enhanced accretion onto the black - hole . at shorter wavelengths ,<n> the mean flux density has not increased by more than@xmath1 relative to historical averages . thus , we can not attribute any increase in the flux density to a g2-induced enhancement of the accretion rate , should g2 be fully disrupted , are uncertain . the amplitude and timescale for a change in the accreting black hole mass are uncertain<n> . however , if the disrupted material is confined to a few schwarzschild radii to contribute to the accretion flow and/or we present alma observations of sgr a * at frequencies from 100 to 950 ghz .<n> the millimeter / submillimeter spectrum is consistent with a flat spectrum , as expected for stratified emission from an accretion disk with optical depth in transition between optically thick and thin . at these frequencies , the event horizon telescope ( eht ) will be able to image the radio through millimeter emission from g2 s . <n> gravitational lensing ( gl ) is a powerful tool to probe the accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , providing constraints on the mass accretion rate , geometry of the accretion disk , and the nature and origin of the accreting material . the gravitationally lensed source , g2@xmath0 , was first observed in the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength regime with the _ hubble space telescope _<n> ( _ hst _ ) @xcite , revealing a black hole shadow that is offset by @xmath1 from the gravitational radius of the black hole . in the radio / millimeter regime ,<n> the source has been monitored with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) we present alma observations of the submillimeter continuum emission from a sample of nine quasars with redshifts @xmath0 .<n> we detect emission from seven of the nine objects , with continuum fluxes ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 mjy , and submillimeter emission from one object , sdss j1148 + 2223 , at 0.45 mm . <n> the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of submillimeter galaxies are dominated by emission from dust and are characterized by a broad range of temperatures and luminosities , ranging from those of the ism to those of starburst galaxies . in most cases<n> , the continuum emission is resolved into a point - like component , a dust component and a ionized gas component . however , in a few cases , continuum emission can be resolved into more than one component and the dust , gas , or both may be present in the continuum , making it difficult to separate the emission from the dust and gas components . for example , we see a dust - to - gas ratio as high as 1000 in the isothermal starburst galaxy ngc 6240 , but no dust or gas we present high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise , time - resolved measurements of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath0 ) in a high - mobility gaas / algaas quantum well system .<n> we find that the dos exhibit a broad distribution with a narrow peak centered at the gap edge , and a broad tail extending beyond the gap , consistent with a fermi - liquid - like behavior . <n> the high mobility of gaas , _<n> i.e. _ , the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state @xcite , makes it an ideal system for studying the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in quantum wells . in a gaas system ,<n> the spin degree of freedom ( spin - orbit coupling , soc ) of the electrons leads to the formation of a gap in the low - lying dos of the quantum well ( qh ) , while the electrons in the high - lying qh form a mott insulator ( hi ) with a gap that is tunable in energy by an external magnetic field . for a long time , we report on the fabrication and characterization of a @xmath0 nm laser - pulse generator ( lpg ) .<n> the device consists of an e - print of an ab - initio quantum dot coupled to an atomic force microscope ( afm ) to produce a high - resolution single - photon pulse with a pulse repetition rate of 10@xmath1 hz / s . the device is demonstrated to operate at room temperature , with a peak power of 15.8 v / cm , and a pulse shape with a gaussian profile . <n> the ability to produce high - quality e - prints is a key requirement for the development of quantum technologies , such as quantum computers @xcite , quantum photonics @xxcite and ultra - sensitive force microscopy ( uro)@xcite for atomic and molecular physics . for these applications ,<n> it is important to have a method for producing e -prints that can be scaled up to large numbers of photons , while maintaining a low cost and a high quality of output photon . to this end<n> , it has been proposed that a quantum dot ( qd ) can be used as a source of single photons . we report on a systematic study of the temperature and magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the electrical resistivity of a wide range of multiferroic materials .<n> we find that the resistivity is strongly suppressed in the vicinity of the superconducting transition temperature , and that the onset of resistivity is accompanied by a rapid increase of the critical field , suggesting that the field - induced phase transition is driven by a change in the topological phase of the order parameter . <n> the superconducting ( sc ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials have been the subject of intense interest in recent years due to their unusual properties and potential application in spintronic devices @xcite . in particular ,<n> fm materials are of particular interest because of their strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which is expected to lead to the formation of a spin - gap in the bulk , superconducting state , as well as in ferromagnets and high-@xmath1 cuprates . on the other hand , fm and<n> sc materials exhibit a variety of other interesting properties , such as high critical currents , high mobility , low dimensionality , long - range order , strong spin polarization  high - resolution spectroscopy of sub - millisecond pulsars ( @xmath0 ) at the caltech sub - millimetre observatory ( cso ) has revealed a new type of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .<n> we report the discovery of a new class of pulsars , which we term  ultra - compact pulsars ' ( ucps ) because of their compactness and velocity dispersions . in these pulsars<n> , the pulsar s spin is aligned with the spin of the underlying black hole ( bh ) and the pulsar angular momentum is antiparallel to the angular momentum of the bh , so that the pulsar spins are parallel to the axis of the spin - orbit ( so ) relation . as a result ,<n> the pulsar spin - down ( s@xmath1 ) time scales with the bh spin time , and , as a consequence , their spin properties are significantly different from those of radio pulsars of the same spin period , even though the pulsars and bhs have similar masses and spin frequencies . <n> a number of studies have shown that radio - quiet agn are associated with a population of ultracompact ( ucl we present multi - band photometric observations of four ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , namely , alma x-3 , cetus x-1 , and rxj 1608.4 - 2901 .<n> we find that all four objects are dominated by continuum emission from a hot dust component , with @xmath0 mags . in all four cases ,<n> the continuum emission is dominated by a single power - law component with spectral slope @xcite . <n> _ introduction _ : _ it is well - known that dust emission can play an important role in many astrophysical systems , including star - forming galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( xbs ) as well as the galactic center ( gc ) ( see e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein )<n> . however , it is still unclear whether dust emission is a universal property of agn or whether it is dependent on the intrinsic properties of the host galaxy . to investigate this<n> , we present photometric measurements of the dust emission from these objects using alma s adaptive optics ( ao ) system . we present a study of the collision of two ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at @xmath0 .<n> we find that the total energy of the incident particles is larger than the collision energy of one of the colliding particles , and that both particles remain at rest during the collision . <n> we also study the dependence of the total collision energy on the relative velocity of the two colliding particles and on the angle between the collision axis and the propagation vector of the particles . in the case of two colliding heavy ions ,<n> the collisional energy spectrum is found to be broad , with a broad minimum at intermediate velocity , similar to the spectrum of heavy quark collisions . for a collision between two light quarks , however , there is no minimum at any velocity ; instead , the minimum is found at low velocity and increases as the quark number increases . we present a study of the angular spectra of the light curves of the sub - dassiopeia b supernovae ( sdss ) .<n> the data are well described by a combination of a black - hole ( bh ) potential and a delta - function potential , with the first harmonic being equal to the angular diameter of the host galaxy , @xmath0 , and with the second harmonic being proportional to the eccentricity of the bh center of mass . <n> we also find that the angular spectrum of the sn 2013j ( draco ) is very similar to that of the sloan digital sky survey data , except that the third harmonic is slightly smaller and the first and second harmonics are slightly larger than the observed ones . in the future<n> , we plan to study the behavior of the dipolar component of the b - field , which can be produced by the interaction of the black hole with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , using the data of the drell - yan supernova ( dysn ) and the dresden - wilson ( dw ) x - ray binary ( xrb ) supernovae , as well as the we report the discovery of two new bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , viz . <n> , the first to be discovered in any bec .<n> the becs are produced in the sub - chandrasekhar limit of the reissner - nordstrm solution to the regge - wheeler - dewitt equation , which describes the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition . as a result of these discoveries ,<n> the number of known becs in the first quarter of 2014 is increased by a factor of two to 12 , and the total number of such bosonic becs is estimated to be about 30 . in the future , studies of becs produced in more than one bec are expected to provide further insights into the nature of the qgp and the phase diagram of quark matter . we present early results from a gravitational lensing survey of the gravitationally lensed quasars ( qsos ) gro j1655 - 3658 ( @xmath0 ) , gro j0735 - 3651 ( @ xmath1 ) and gro j1520 - 3050 ( wn3 ) carried out with the adaptive optics system adaptive optics babar at the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in the mediterranean .<n> we find that the majority of the lensing events are dominated by secondary eclipses of the primary lens , with a few events dominated by lensing amplification , and a small number of events by gravitationally induced lensing ( gini ) from the secondary lens . <n> the fraction of lensing - induced gini events is found to increase with increasing duration of the event , which is consistent with the hypothesis that the gini amplification is due to lensing effects , rather than to amplification due to gravitational wave radiation from the primary source . in general , the number of gini - induced events increases as the event duration increases , indicating that the magnification of the secondary source increases as well we present the results of multi - epoch optical spectroscopy of a sample of late - type agb stars at luminosities of @xmath0 - 2 mag .<n> the spectra cover the agb phase of the formation of the host agb star , from t = -6 to t@xmath1 = -7 kpc , and are dominated by the emission lines of h and he , as well as by continuum , emission and absorption components from the hot ionised gas . in most cases ,<n> the h lines are found to be blueshifted with respect to the stellar systemic velocity , but in a few cases there are also clear detections of absorption lines . <n> the presence of cool , ionized gas in early - type stars is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) . at late times<n> , the cs m is expected to be at higher redshifts , resulting in a higher line - of - sight ( lss ) number of emission lines seen in the spectra . as a result , a higher fraction of these emission lines can be attributed to h lines , which we present multi - band photometric monitoring observations of a sample of nine active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with soft x - ray luminosities of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .<n> these data show that the fraction of active galaxies with hard x - rays increases as the agn phase is approached , with the fraction reaching a maximum of 60% at jupiter - mass . in most cases , however , the fraction is found to be lower than expected for a black - body distribution of the host galaxy s mass and distance from the central black hole , due to the adiabatic expansion of the hard radiation from the active galactic nucleus . <n> active galaxies are those that emit most of their energy in the form of hard radiation , which is emitted over their lifetime , rather than in a steady - state mode , as is the case for most galaxies , such as those hosting black - holes . as a result ,<n> the astrophysical properties of agn host galaxies can differ significantly from those of normal galaxies . for example , in a normal agn , a large fraction of the total luminosity is emitted in the hard state , while we present early light curves of the double pulsars psr j1808.4 - 3658 ( @xmath0 , 13.6h ) and psrs j1809.1 - 3651 ( @ xmath1 , 13.3h , 14.2hr ) obtained with the hubble space telescope .<n> both pulsars are found to be in their spin - down states at the same time , with the spin parameter of the second pulsar increasing from zero to nearly unity over the first few minutes of each pulsar s spin - up cycle . the pulsar spins down more rapidly than its isothermal companion , which is consistent with spin - orbit interaction . <n> pulsars : general stars : neutron stars . we present early timings of the light curves of the double pulsars psr 1913 + 14 and ps rossi x - ray timing arrays ( ptas ) 20130705 and 20130811 .<n> the timings are from the sub - millisecond period of the pulsars and cover the orbital phases of the two pulsars , which are separated by @xmath0 days . for the 20130805 data , we find that both pulsars are close to the hertzsprung - russell diagram , but the timings differ significantly from each other . we report the discovery of a binary system consisting of a blue supergiant and a red supergiant with a separation of @xmath0 .<n> the system has a common proper motion of the two stars and the binary components are expected to be close in the binary system . <n> supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most common type of stellar - mass black holes in the universe , but their formation and evolution are still not well understood . in most cases , however , the black holes accrete mass from the surrounding agn and are assumed to be at the eddington - limited ( e.g. , @xcite ) mass - accretion rate . the most extreme case is the binary black hole system in the active galaxy m31 ( ngc 6611 ) , which experienced mass transfer from a companion and its black hole evolved to a close binary system with an orbital period of 3 gyr and a mass ratio close to unity ( see fig . [ fig : binary ] ] and the accompanying paper , ] where the companion was a massive black hole ( bh ) and the agn was a low - mass ( we present early timings of four quasar pairs produced by the collision of the two black holes at the center of the active galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> the timings of the pairs were extracted from the combined light curves of the x - ray pulsars 1e0223 - 3651 and 1e0648 - 3652 obtained with the _ swift_/xrt , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observatories , respectively . based on these timings<n> , we estimate that the black hole had an initial velocity of @xmath0 and its companion had a maximum velocity of about 200 km s@xmath1 at the time of the collision . we present early timings of four pulsating x - ray binaries at @xmath0 from _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations .<n> the individual stars show rapid thermal variability on time scales of a few tens of seconds , with typical amplitudes of 0.3 mag . from combined analysis of individual stars ,<n> we find that the fractional rms amplitude of the variability is typically 0.1 mag , which is lower than the value of 0.08 mag reported for the individual pulsars . we present early spectra of the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) from the _ hubble space telescope _ and the very large array .<n> the early spectra are dominated by emission from the central engine , and show rapid thermal bremsstrahlung ( rtb ) and sub - keplerian ( sph ) components . in the later spectra , we see a possible secondary component , which may be a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . <n> ulx s are among the most luminous x - rays ever discovered , with a mean luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 and a peak - to - peak flux ratio of about 25 , making them among the brightest objects in the sky . however , the majority of the sources are found close to the galactic centre , where the accretion rate is low and the emission is dominated by the thermal component . as a result , they are intrinsically more luminous than any previously known ulx with the same peak luminosity , allowing us to investigate the nature of the accretion flow on the centre of the system . despite the extreme brightness of the systems , most we present the results of a survey of high - resolution optical spectroscopy of a sample of nearby young stellar objects ( ysos ) using the atacama large millimetre / sub - millimetre array ( alma ) .<n> we find that the spectra are dominated by emission lines of h and he ii , and exhibit a wide range of physical parameters . from the analysis of the spectra ,<n> we conclude that most of the yso emission lines are from he ii and h@xmath0 instabilities . <n> recent studies have shown that young stars form in dense star forming regions ( dfrs ) around massive stars ( msbs ) @xcite . however , there is no consensus yet on the formation mechanism of young stars , although it has been suggested that the central engine of a dfr may be an ultracompact hii region ( uchii ) or a supernova remnant ( snr )",

energy physics , condensed matter and relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in this context<n> , it is of interest to understand the behavior of the system close to the critical point , where the system undergoes a phase transition from a low - energy , disordered state to a high - temperature , strongly - correlated state . to this end ,<n> a number of theoretical approaches have been developed , starting from the we consider the ultralocal behavior of the first and the second cumulants of the @xmath0 model in the limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom .<n> we find that the threshold functions are subdominant with respect to the  ultralocal '' quantities , in such a way that the latter go to a constant as one approaches the fixed point . <n> pacs numbers : 05.30.-d , 05.70.fh , 11.10.wx 2 in this paper , we investigate the ultra -

[ eq_v ] ) , but with the addition of a bath - temperature term to the lagrangian . in the close vicinity of the fixed point , we find a boundary - layer structure , where rare low - energy excitations above the ground -

frg ) in a superfield formalism@xcite that allows us to discuss the critical behavior of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) from the parisi - sourlas perspective of an underlying supersymmetry and its breaking .<n> we have proposed a solution for properly selecting the ground state among the many metastable states that are present at zero temperature . through the introduction of an appropriate regulator and a supersymmetry - compatible non perturbationative approximation , we have been able to follow the supersymmetry ( more precisely , the superrotational invariance ) and its spontaneous breaking along the rg flow . despite the fact that the effective hamiltonian in the presence of a random field has numerous minima in the region of interest near the critical point , dimensional reduction need not be systematically broken . by implementing a np- frg flow for the cumulants of the renormalized disorder , our work shows that there is a finite range of dimension below the upper critical dimension , @xmath0 , for which this multiplicity of minima has no effect on the long - distance properties of the model . more precisely we investigate the role played by the gribov ambiguity in the nonperturbative quantization of the linear sigma model ( lsm ) .<n> we show that the ambiguity does not affect the perturbative regime , so that calculations at high energy can be performed in the standard faddeev - popov approach . however , very little is known on the influence of this  gribovian ambiguity '' in the nonlinear regime . to illustrate that a linear cusp in @xmath0 does not generate a supercusp and may break dimensional reduction , we consider the erge for the fourier transform of the 2-point proper vertex ( for uniform fields ) in the limit . we switch to the variables _<n> i _ , _ ii _ and _ iii _ to show that dimensional reduction does not hold in this case . as a benchmark model to test the ability of our nonperturbive approximation scheme to reproduce this property ,<n> we perform a calculation in the present paper of the two - point proper vertex of the rfim at zero temperature , when driven by a slow change of the external magnetic field ( rfim@xmath1 ) and we investigate its hysteresis behavior and we study the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow of the beta - functional in the presence of a cusp .<n> we show that rg flow does not necessarily lead to the breakdown of dimensional reduction , as has been recently claimed , but rather , to the emergence of a stronger nonanalyticity leading to a breakdown of the dimensionally - reduced flow . in order to do so<n> , we introduce the concept of dimensionless threshold functions , which are functions of the infrared cutoff functions and the propagators , and study their behavior as a function of the threshold function . <n> dimensional reduction is a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theory ( qft ) . at the heart of the problem<n> is the question of whether or not dimensional reduction can lead to a quantum description that is invariant under _ a priori _ many - body transformations , _<n> i.e. _ , under local symmetries of the hamiltonian . as such , dimensional reduction has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in quantum physics , from high - energy physics to condensed - matter physics and qft @xcite . however , we study the flow equations for the @xmath0 superconductor - insulator - metal - superconductor ( sis ) transition in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we find that the critical exponents are determined by the ir cutoff function , which has an anomalous scaling when dimensional reduction is broken . using the principle of minimal sensitivity ,<n> we determine the anomalous exponents . <n> pacs numbers : 05.70.jk , 05.50.+q , 64.60.cn , 75.10.hk 2 recently , there has been renewed interest in the critical behavior of superconductors and insulators with an applied magnetic field@xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the nature of the transition that occurs when the field is switched off in the superconducting state . for a superconductor , the transition is generally first - order , but it is possible that the transition may be continuous , discontinuous , or discontinuous only in certain regions of the phase diagram . on the other hand , for an insulator , a transition is usually continuous and occurs only in a very narrow region of phase space . at the same time , in a normal phase , we present a new method for the determination of critical exponents in the np - frg .<n> the method is based on the exact formulation of the flow equations and does not require approximations to be introduced , which are only an intermediate means that does not affect the long - distance physics . as an example , we solve the exact equations for the two - dimensional nambu - jona - lasinio model and determine the dependence of the exponents on the parameters of the ir regulator . <n> it is a long - standing problem in theoretical physics to determine the precise value of the critical exponent @xmath0 in the framework of quantum field theory ( qft ) . in qft<n> , it is well known that the transverse dimension of the operator hamiltonian is not a physical quantity that can be measured precisely , but that it can be determined by measuring the anomalous dimensions of the system @xcite . for the latter quantity ,<n> the precision of the determination is limited by the uncertainty in the values of the transverse dimensions , due to the non - perturbative nature of the problem , and by the lack of a precise determination of the infrared ( ir ) cutoff function @x we study the critical behavior of the @xmath0-component of the yang - mills theory in a transverse magnetic field .<n> we perform a detailed analysis of the variational properties of the ir critical exponents in the range [ _ i.e. _ the range of values in which the anomalous dimensions in the two - dimensional phase space @math1 are close to each other . <n> we observe the borel resummation procedure , and we use it to determine the exponents . we also observe numerical instabilities during the numerical integration of the flow . 2 <n> . lattice field theory ( lft ) @xcite is a powerful theoretical framework for the study of critical phenomena in condensed matter physics . in lft<n> , the perturbative qcd is supplemented by a transverse ( or field ) field which acts as a perturbation . at the same time , a nonperturbative term in the hamiltonian is added , _<n> e.g _ a transverse field is present in the theory . as a result ,<n> the qcd phase diagram has been extensively studied in the literature ( see , for example , ref . [ eq  supersymmetric ( susy ) field theory ( fft ) , which is based on the mori - zwanzig ( mz ) action , has been very successful in describing a wide range of physical systems , including liquid crystals , superfluids , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and griffiths phases.@xcite however , it has not yet been rigorously applied to the study of disordered systems . in this letter<n> , we show how to use susy field theory to simulate _ analytically _ the effects of renormalized disorder in the simplest case of a bec , _ i.e. _ in the presence of a small gaussian source .<n> this is achieved by numerically solving the renormalization group flow equations for a  random field '' that is _ not _ a superposition of sources , as in the mz action . <n> _ introduction : _ disorder is a ubiquitous phenomenon in condensed matter physics , ranging from liquid crystals to superconductors . at low temperatures and densities ,<n> the disorder - induced order parameter of a system can be nonanalytic  we propose a simple approximation scheme to describe the long - distance behavior of the non - abelian @xmath0 theory in the presence of a random field .<n> the scheme is based on a derivative expansion in the proper vertices , supplemented by a finite ultraviolet cutoff and cumulants ; it satisfies the requirement of no explicit susy breaking and the associated wt identities . as a first application , we show that this approximation scheme is able to reproduce the leading non - gaussian corrections to the semi - classical result for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . <n> it has been known for a long time that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics at short distances breaks down at the planck scale due to the appearance of new particles , most notably supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite . in recent years , however , it has become clear that the sm may not be the correct theory to describe low - energy processes at long distances , and that new physics may appear at the short - distance scale , associated with susy , in a non - trivial way . a natural way to address this issue is to consider a random - field theory ( rft ) , in this paper , we consider a class of hamiltonian systems which are described by a fixed - point function , i.e. , a set of terms that are linear in the variable @xmath0 .<n> the fixed point function can be written as a sum of two terms , one of which is a gaussian , and the other is a polynomial . in the case of a scalar potential ,<n> the two polynomials are expressed in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function . <n> pacs number(s ) : 02.30.gp , 11.10.lm , 12.20.ds in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom @xcite , such as spin systems , lattice gases , or bosonic condensates , with the goal of understanding the physics of these systems in the low - energy regime , as well as in the high energy regime ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for a review of the field of bose - einstein condensates in this field )<n> . however , the description of such systems in",

recoil parton contributions in a qgp environment . using monte carlo simulations of the boltzmann transport equation in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , we study the dependence of small - angle two - parton scattering matrix elements on the number of active quark flavors in the qgp and the initial energy of the hard parton .<n> we find that the small angle matrix elements for @xmath0 diverge at small angle , as expected , when quasi - particle modes due to hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) corrections are taken into account in the calculation of scattering rates and transport coefficients . on the other hand , matrix elements with large angle divergences are not sensitive to the number and type of final -

perturbative phenomenon in quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) and has a strong influence on the properties of hadrons . while the theory has a good description of parton - hadron scattering in the the low - temperature effective theory ( lbt ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and zero baryon chemical potential is extended to include parton scattering in a thermal qgp medium .<n> analytic estimates of the total parton and parton - quark scattering cross sections in a constant temperature thermal medium are obtained , and monte carlo simulations of the model are performed to study the dependence of the scattering rates on the incident energy and the temperature . <n> the study of the thermal properties of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a long - standing goal in nuclear physics @xcite . in particular<n> , it is important to understand the structure of the medium in which qcd is formed , as well as to understand its dependence on the collision energy and on the chemical potential of the target . at temperatures below the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath0 mev , the qgp undergoes a phase transition from a hadron - dominated matter to a qcd - like plasma , which is characterized by a finite baryon number density and a temperature much higher than the debye screening temperature of the qcd plasma . as a result ,<n> qcd parton scattering in a thermal medium at temperatures above the qcd phase transition temperature is dominated by rescattering with partons in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we show that the total cross section for parton -

particle correlation function @xcite . at the same time , many theoretical studies have been done to understand the energy spectra and the spectra of the thermal partons produced in the collisions . however , little is known about the energy distributions of the outgoing partons in the selected channels of the qgp processes . here<n> we present a study of the quark -

medium scattering is an important tool to investigate the properties of the hot and dense medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in particular<n> , it is important to understand how the quark and gluon densities in the medium change as the collision energy is increased , which can be done by studying the spectra of the partons in the final states of the scattering processes . as a result of this change in the density ,<n> parton distributions are modified in the collision process . for a proper description of the spectra , one has to take into account not only the initial parton s energy but also its thermal energy @xmath0 , but also the energy carried by the outgoing parton in the scattering process , i.e. , the energy difference between the incident parton and the final part multiple parton scattering and jet - induced medium excitation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions are discussed in the light of the large hadron collider ( lbt ) model .<n> parton - medium scatterings are introduced into the monte carlo program in the lbt model and the medium - induced jet excitation in the lepton - hadron ( lhc ) collision is calculated in the multiple - parton approach . we present a hydrodynamical model for the propagation of partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium .<n> parton scatterings are treated classically and energy and momentum are strictly conserved in each parton - medium scattering . in this model , partons propagate through the qgp medium with a mean - free - path length much shorter than the thermal propagation length . as a result ,<n> partons are strongly influenced by the medium , which has a strong effect on their kinematics and on their decay products . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.mh , 24.85.+p , 25.75.-q relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( rhic ) provide a unique opportunity to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , at a very early stage of its development @xcite . at rhic energies , qcd matter undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined state of strongly interacting quarks and gluons , known as the quark gluon - plasma ( qtgp , for short ) @xmath0 , and a qcd phase transition is expected to occur at a the leading parton transverse momentum broadening and elastic energy loss in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are studied in the framework of the longitudinally - polarized ( lbt ) boltzmann transport equation with induced gluon bremsstrahlung .<n> the results are compared with the experimental data from the zeus and h1 collaborations and the predictions of the lbt model are also discussed . <n> the study of parton propagation in a qgp medium has been an important topic in both experimental and theoretical studies of qcd . in recent years , the results from hera @xcite-@xcite and lep @xmath0-@xmath1 experiments have shown that the energy - momentum density of a jet - induced medium parton can be larger than that of a thermal parton in a uniform and static qcd medium , leading to the increase of the transverse momentum of the final parton and the corresponding energy loss of the parton . on the other hand ,<n> the longitudinal momentum broadening of a parton propagating in a hot and dense qgp has not been observed in experiments so far . to understand the origin of this phenomenon , in this paper<n> , we multiple parton - parton scatterings in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and baryon density are studied within the light - front model ( lbt ) .<n> the transverse momentum distribution and the accumulated transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton at different times are calculated and compared to the gaussian distribution obtained in a small - angle approximation of @xmath0 cross sections . <n> heavy quarkonium ( hf ) production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is a unique tool to study the properties of the hot and dense qcd medium created in the collision of two or more heavy quarks @xcite . in hf collisions ,<n> one of the most important observables is the azimuthal anisotropy of the transverse distribution of the produced hf particles , which is proportional to the energy density of the medium and can be measured as a function of the angle between the two rapidity intervals of the emitted hf particle . at high energy densities , however , the asymmetries in the distribution can be strongly reduced due to gluon bremsstrahlung ( gbl ) in the qgp medium . the the leading parton ( parton ) propagation in a hot and dense qgp medium is studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> we show that the transverse momentum distributions of the parton from its single scatterings with the medium partons will evolve with time due to transverse momentum broadening . after a few fm/@xmath0 of propagation , however , the partonic transverse momentum distribution deviates from the power law and approach a gaussian . to illustrate this evolution , we calculate the elastic energy loss per unit length from lbt simulations . within a recent perturbative calculation within a htl pqcd approach @xcite<n> , it is also shown that the energy loss of a gluon in a uniform medium is comparable to that of a quark in the same temperature region . in the lbt model , one can also study the evolution of the transverse - momentum distribution and the energy - loss of the propagating parton as a function of the initial parton energy . <n> the study of the propagation of partons in a dense and hot medium is of great importance in particle physics and cosmology , as well as in lattice qcd ( lqcd we present results from lattice qcd ( lbt ) simulations of the energy loss of a gluon and a quark in a hot and dense medium .<n> we compare results from lbt simulations of a single scattering and multiple scatterings over a long distance to analytic results from perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) in the leading logarithmic approximation . in a static medium with a temperature @xmath0 , 300 and 400 mev , the energy dependence of the quark s elastic energy loss is larger than that of the gluon s . for lower temperatures ,<n> the energy - dependent quark energy loss has a smaller energy dependence than for the energy dependent gluon energy loss . <n> one of the most important questions in the study of the thermodynamic properties of hot dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is to understand the mechanisms of energy loss from quarks and gluons in a qcd medium @xcite . to this end<n> , it is important to have a good understanding of the dependence of quark and gluon elastic energy losses on the temperature and the initial energy of the qgp medium , as well as on the properties of the scattering matrix @x we study the elastic energy loss of a parton in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) using the light - front quantization ( lbt ) model .<n> we show that the logarithmic energy dependence of the parton s energy loss leads to a logarithmically small energy loss for a leading parton during multiple scatterings in a qgp medium at a given temperature . during single scatterings ,<n> the energy and momentum conservation during each scattering is also logarithmically dependent on the initial parton energy , leading to smaller energy loss . for subsequent scatterings<n> , the reduced energy will lead to a smaller elastic energy lost , which will then lead to an overall reduction of the averaged energy loss per unit distance over a long distance . in a uniform medium at the highest temperature , this energy loss remains almost a constant even at a later time . <n> parton propagation through a hot , dense and strongly interacting medium is a fundamental problem in qcd @xcite . due to the interaction of the particles with the medium , partons<n> will lose their energy along their propagation path . as a result , during their propagation , they will lose energy and also momentum the propagation of partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature is studied within the light - front quantization ( lbt ) model .<n> parton propagation in a qgp medium is shown to result in equilibration of the energy and momentum deposited in the medium , which is responsible for the broadening of the parton energy spectra . in the limit of a thermal spectrum , however , the spectra of leading and jet - induced medium partons will eventually merge and approach thermal spectra as a result of the equilibrating . <n> + + pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.st , 13.85.qk , 14.40.lb the study of parton - medium interactions is one of the most important topics in the investigation of the properties of hot and dense qcd matter @xcite . within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,<n> the energy loss of a parton in a medium is described by the gluon distribution function ( gdf ) which is a convolution of the initial gluon s distribution with the final gluon state s energy distribution . during the propagation , partons in this article , we present a study of parton spectra and jet reconstruction in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium using the light - front quantization ( lbt ) model in monte carlo simulations .<n> we find that parton - medium scatterings lead to a significant modification of the parton spectrum in a qgp medium compared to the case without scatterings . as a result ,<n> the spectra of the leading parton in each @xmath0 scattering and the recoil medium parton that participate in the scattering are significantly different from that of the non - interacting case . in particular , the partons from the scatterings with the medium have a much softer spectrum than the incident parton , and the ratio of their four - momenta is larger than that of incident partons in a single scattering . on the other hand , in the case with scatterings without a uniform medium , partons with a large four - momentum<n> do not have a large enough energy to be excited in a medium with a medium - free equation of state ( eos ) since the scattering is dominated by small - angle processes . to study the effect of the scattering on the propagation of we study jet quenching at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . in this model , the propagation of a parton through a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium results in the excitation of gluon - induced medium partons .<n> we show that the number of such medium excitations in each event of parton propagation is limited due to the linear response of the qgp medium to the propagation and transport of the parton . <n> the study of the suppression of heavy quarkonia production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the lhc has opened up new possibilities to investigate the properties of strongly - interacting matter under extreme conditions . at lhc<n> , one of the main goals is to search for the signatures of the strongly - coupled quarks and gluons produced in the central rapidity region of the collision @xmath0 of two oppositely - charged hadrons at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev . during the process of jet production , partons from the initial quark and gluon clusters produce a number of partons in the final state  the leading parton propagating in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium accumulates transverse momentum broadening due to its interaction with the hot and dense qgp medium .<n> this broadening induces a smearing in the direction of the source term for jet - induced medium excitation and eventually leads to the elliptic paraboloid shape of the shock wave trailing the propagating parton . within the linear response theory ( lbt ) model ,<n> the diffused shock wave induced by the jet - medium interaction is elliptic while the sharp mach - cone is recovered in hydrodynamic simulations or anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft)-type correspondence studies . <n> parton - parton collisions ( mcs ) play an important role in the formation and propagation of partons in the qgp as well as in the early stage of a heavy - ion collision @xcite . in mcs<n> , partons interact with the surrounding medium through medium recoil and negative \" partons . as a result , the energy density of medium partons increases separately with time and the net energy density , however , remains approximately constant because of energy - momentum conservation and the near constant energy- and momentum - transfer jet - induced medium parton distributions in high - energy heavy - ion collisions are sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening of leading partons propagating in a qgp medium .<n> we show that the broadening leads to a broadening of the azimuthal anisotropies of event - averaged partons , which will affect the final parton spectra . <n> the study of angular distributions of partons produced in jet - production processes has been a unique tool to probe the properties of hot and dense qcd matter at high temperatures @xcite . in the last decade<n> , parton transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distributions have been measured in a variety of different processes , such as electron - positron and proton - proton collisions , pp collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , and nucleus - nucleus collisions at fermilab . due to<n> the large transverse momentum of the produced partons in the initial collision , their transverse momentum distribution in the final collisions is expected to be strongly asymmetric , i.e. , the partons are expected to have a much broader distribution than the initial parton distribution . as a result ,<n> the we study jet quenching in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev within the framework of parton hadronization with partonic jets reconstructed from final partons .<n> we find that the energy loss of the initial propagating parton leads to a broad spectrum of negative \" partons with a broad angular distribution that does not change much over time . at later times , however , the transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton and diffusion of thermal recoil partons leads to the disappearance of the double - peak structure in the angular distribution of the negative partons and to stronger contributions from jet - induced medium partons that have a narrow angular distribution . <n> parton energy loss in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is characterized by the production of jets , which are collimated hadrons with azimuthal angle that are reconstructed from their calorimetric energy within a jet cone @xcite . in the literature<n> , it has been studied in terms of jet energy loss and the elliptic flow of the final hadronic final state , as well as the hbt radii of the produced hadronic jets . here , we study the jet energy and jet spectra as a function of pseudorapid we study the effect of parton propagation in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) on reconstructed jets in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .<n> parton energy loss due to multiple scatterings with the qgp medium is calculated in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model . by taking into account the energy loss of the propagating parton and the modification of the underlying jet background due to the diffusion wake induced by the negative \" partons , we are able to reconstruct jets that are free of energy loss and have high transverse momenta . <n> the study of jets produced in high - energy collisions is an important part of the experimental program at the large hadron collider ( lhc) at cern . at lhc<n> , one of the main goals is to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , the search for the higgs boson , which is the missing link of the sm , has been proposed as a way to understand the properties of qcd matter at high energy densities @xcite . to this end , many experimental studies have been carried out on the suppression of high-@xmath0 events in order to we investigate the propagation of an energetic parton through a qgp medium .<n> the interaction of energetic partons with the medium partons leads to a transverse momentum broadening of the leading parton . during jet transport ,<n> the effective jet energy loss is proportional to the square of the total transverse momentum with respect to the initial parton direction . with the subtraction of negative \" partons from the jet cone<n> , the jet effective energy loss can be larger than the energy of negative partons alone . <n> qcd partons propagating through a hot and dense medium carry a significant fraction of the transverse momentum of the medium , which can be measured in a variety of hadron - hadron and heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in these collisions , partons may produce strongly interacting hadrons , such as electrons and quarks , or gluons , in addition to quarks and antiquarks . at a hadron collider , a large number of hard partons will be produced , leading to the formation of a strongly interacting qgp ( qgp ) . due to the strong coupling of qgp partons to partons in the qgp phase , perturbative we study the evolution of fragmentation functions and the composition of reconstructed jets produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions using large hadron collider ( lbt ) monte carlo simulations .<n> we find that the fragmentation functions are sensitive to the parton - medium interaction and the energy loss of the energetic leading parton during its propagation through the medium . in terms of the longitudinal momentum fraction of the original jet energy ,<n> the reconstructed jets are more sensitive to parton energy loss than the momentum fractions of the reconstructed jet energy and the soft parton distributions within reconstructed jets . <n> the study of parton propagation through a dense and viscous medium has become an important topic in the context of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which is expected to be created in the collision of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies @xcite . during the propagation of a parton through a medium , it is accompanied by the scattering of the medium partons , which may lead to fragmentation and the formation of a jet . to understand the mechanism of jet formation in qgp<n> , one would like to know the initial conditions in the medium as well as the evolution with time of the partons as they propagate through the parton distributions are calculated at different times for a propagating gluon in a uniform quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and for a gluon propagating in a static and homogeneous medium at a temperature @xmath0 mev .<n> the partons are calculated in the parton model , which includes leading , recoil , and negative \" partons , as well as all partons that do not have negative partons in the jet cone . in the static qgp medium ,<n> the leading parton distribution is found to be very different from that in the homogeneous medium and the results are compared to recent lattice qcd calculations . <n> the study of partons is an important tool in the analysis of heavy ion collisions as they contain important information about the properties of the hot and dense medium created in these collisions . during the past few years<n> , much work has been done to understand the structure of the gluon distribution in a qgp and in particular in the case of a static medium @xcite . at the same time , it is of interest to study the behavior of the quarks in the qgp as a function of the temperature and the density of the medium . for a static we study the evolution of the jet transverse structure in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . to this end , we have developed a new perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach to jet transport in a qgp medium based on the local parton model ( lbt ) and monte carlo simulations of parton propagation .<n> we calculated the jet transport coefficient and the energy loss per mean - free - path for each elastic scattering between the leading and thermal medium partons . <n> @xmath0laboratoire de physique thorique lapth , + bp110 , f-74941 , annecy - le - vieux cedex , france + _ @xcite in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , partons can produce highly collimated and strongly interacting hadrons , such as jets , by scattering off quarks and gluons in the surrounding medium . in these collisions<n> , the energy of the incoming parton can be as high as 100 gev , leading to the formation of jets in the final state . at high energies ,<n> partons lose energy to the medium , parton propagation in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) medium is studied in the light - front transport ( lbt ) model .<n> the leading parton propagating through the qgp medium is shown to form a supersonic shock wave and a diffusion wake behind it due to the transport of jet - induced medium partons ( thermal recoil partons and negative \" partons from the back - reaction ) in a supersonic medium wave . the diffusion wake has a diffused mach - cone shape because of the transverse momentum broadening of the lead parton along its path . transport of these medium parton - induced partons outside the jet cone results in a significant reduction of jet energy loss which should be taken into account for any realistic study of jet suppression in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . using a modified version of the fastjet jet - finding package with the anti - @xmath0 algorithm in which the energy of negative \" component from the reaction is subtracted , we show the effect of transport of the jet - inducing medium partions and their dissipation in medium on reconstructed jets . their inclusion in the jet reconstruction also influences the transverse - momentum broadening , parton distributions ( fragmentation functions ) and transverse profiles of reconstructed jets we study the parton distributions in pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev at the lhc . in particular , we focus on the elliptic paraboloid shape of the shock wave induced by a propagating parton . <n> pacs numbers : : 25.75.-q , 13.85.ni , 14.40.lb in the past few years , a great deal of work has been devoted to the study of high energy heavy -

parton saturation . we find that the ratio of the nuclear modification factor ( mf ) to the fraction of hadrons produced is consistent with expectations from fluctuation analyses of mf data . <n> the suppression of high-@xmath1 hadron production in heavy -

absorption ( lpm ) effect are purely suppressive , and that there is no enhancement region at all .<n> this contradicts our experience that in targets with correlated scatterings , interference effects are commensurable and accompanied by an enhancement in some region of the spectrum , which we call the anti - lpm effect . in condensed matter ,<n> however , the radiation enhancement can develop only at short distances between atoms , being usually far shorter than photon formation length . <n> the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by condensed matter ( e.g. , liquid , gas , or solid ) has been known to be strongly affected by interference effects @xcite , in particular , by the so - called lpm ( local photon - absorption or local magneto - emission ) effects , associated with interference between photons emitted by the same target at different photon energies . the lpm effects are typically associated with a suppression of the photon energy loss at low @xmath0 , accompanied by a spectral enhancement in a region of that spectrum where the interference is absent @x we address interference effects in bremsstrahlung from a composite target , and propose simple recipes for incorporating coulomb corrections , which give a reasonable balance between precision and simplicity for the addressed case . <n> the anti - long - phase - modulation ( anti - lpm ) effect @xcite is one of the most striking manifestations of quantum interference in scattering processes .<n> it manifests itself on a scale of photon formation length comparable with the range of _ anti_-correlation , that is , of order of atomic size . for photons scattered from a thin layer of substance ,<n> the effect is well understood in terms of the dipole limit ( @xmath0 ) , in which case the spectrum is dominated by interference effects between the two scatterings . at larger separations , however , the interference between the scatterings is usually non - zero , since successive scatterings are not causally connected . as a consequence , averaging over scattering angles ( dipole limit ) yields a product of mean scattering angles , wherefore the whole interference in the spectrum in this approximation vanishes . in this paper , we will concentrate on the case of radiation on two scattering foils with definite electron - photon scattering from a thin layer of a substance to a large - angle inter - jet domain is considered within the blankenbecler - drell approximation .<n> it is shown that the radiation spectrum in the considered range of @xmath0 is determined by the interference between the radiation lines from the initial and final electron lines , which is enhanced by the presence of the structure in the domain between them . <n> pacs numbers : : 41.60.-m , 78.67.-n electron scattering from thin layers of substances has been studied for a long time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the early days of this problem , it was considered only for the case when the thickness of a target is much smaller than the photon formation length . for a large angle scattering ,<n> the small - angle asymptotics of the total radiation spectrum is given by the gaussian distribution , whereas for large angles , the logarithm of the asymptotics is obtained by integration over the radiation cones . here , we present a solution of the problem for an arbitrary target thickness , in the thin -

time integral of the oscillatory function with average amplitude and phase , leads to physical inaccuracy of the results . as a result ,<n> the radiation spectrum of thin targets is not well described by the rossi formula , as is also found from comparison of asymptotics with numerical calculations . in the second part of this paper , a description of multiple coulombic scattering in plates of arbitrary thickness is furnished , in which the multiple scattering angle is taken to be the sum of the rms scattering angle of the radiation field and the radiation length , and the target thickness is defined by the radiation radiation length and the angle of incidence of the scattered radiation . this description , however , does not take into account the possibility of multiple scattering of the incident radiation at different angles , nor the fact that the target itself is irradiated multiple times by the laser field . for we study the effect of target thickness on the optical properties of dielectric foils .<n> we show that for thin targets , a gaussian small -

called  electrovacuum instability , '' it was suggested that the energy spectrum of electron scattering by a vacuum photon may differ from that predicted by the sm , since we present a theory of atom -

bonnet method @x we present a simple approach to the problem of molecular binding in solid - state physics .<n> it is based on the concept of screening radius , which is shown to depend on the scattering angle gaussian - averaged with the rms scattering angle evaluated by the empirical formula - dependence of the coefficient for bremsstrahlung on a free atom . that dependence , in turn , is found to be sensitive to the molecular binding effects . <n> molecular binding ( mb ) is one of the most important physical processes in condensed - matter physics , occurring in a wide range of systems , from molecules to nanoparticles @xcite . in many cases , though , it is not the only one , and there are other mechanisms contributing to mb , as well as in many other situations , where it is crucial for the properties of the system . for example , the binding of carbon atoms to gold surfaces is a well - known example of a molecular process , with the binding energy of @xmath0 mev for c@xmath1 , but it can also be demonstrated in other systems . on the other hand , _ ab - initio _ calculations of the binding energies coulomb correlations in multiple scattering are shown to lead to a non -

+ - - + the scattering properties of a material are determined by the distribution of scattering angles , which can be expressed in terms of an axially - symmetric distribution function @xcite . for a given material ,<n> the scattering angle of a sample in contact with it is a random variable . in the limit of infinitely many scattering sites<n> , this distribution can be approximated by a gaussian , with a scattering angle distribution function ( sdf ) that is independent of the number of scattering sites and of the scattering direction . as a result , the dispersive properties of the material can be calculated by averaging over azimuths of the distribution function , as was recently done by baier and katkov [ phys . rev . lett . *<n> we develop a semiclassical theory of the azimuthally averaged radiative decay of @xmath0 , which is free of the backscattering catastrophe that afflicts all diffractive decays .<n> we show that , contrary to conventional wisdom , the amplitude decays as a power of the angle of incidence , with an exponent that depends on the scattering angle . as a result ,<n> the decay rate is a nonmonotonic function of angle , in contrast to diffractively decaying modes , whose decay rate depends only on the angle at which the radiation is emitted . <n> _ introduction. _ <n> the problem of the decay of a weakly interacting quantum particle ( wimp ) is central to many areas of modern physics , including high - energy particle and nuclear physics @xcite , ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @x<n> . one of the most important issues in these fields is the nature of the underlying interaction between the wimp and the detector . in the case of grbs<n> , it is well known that the interaction can not be described by a classical wave function , since it we study electromagnetic radiation from jets produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .<n> we show that the jet current is dominated by the electromagnetic quadrupole radiation from the half - lines of the colliding ions , which is not the case for the dipole radiation . as a result ,<n> the total jet current in the collision is suppressed . <n> pacs numbers : 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.65.ky relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) is one of the most challenging problems in modern physics , since it involves the interaction of relativistic electrons and nuclei , as well as nuclear and atomic matter @xcite . in rhic<n> , jets are formed by the collisions of two or more relativistic ions with a common target energy , and they carry a significant fraction of the total kinetic energy of the system , @xmath0 . at the same time , the interaction between the ions is supposed to be dipole - like , i.e. , it involves a non - zero electric charge on the target . since the electric charge does not depend on the direction of motion of the ions in the plane of the collision axis , this dipole - saturation of electromagnetic radiation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in physics , chemistry , and biology .<n> however , it is usually assumed that saturation is a linear function of the applied magnetic field . here ,<n> we show that saturation can also exhibit oscillatory behavior , in which the amplitude and phase of the oscillations depend on the scattering angle distribution of the radiation . as a concrete example<n> , we consider the bremsstrahlung from two foils separated by a distance @xmath0 , which is realized in the vicinity of a magnetic - field - induced transition from a high - temperature state to a low - temperature , metastable one . <n> the concept of saturation of radiation has been around for more than a century @xcite . in the linear - response regime , this property manifests itself in the well - known bethe - heitler constant , i.e. , the sum of the absolute values of the scattering - angle distribution functions over the two - dimensional euclidean space , divided by the endpoint of the distribution function , is equal to the saturation value . according to this result , at the transition from the high- to the low- temperature limit , a it is shown that anti - phase - shift ( anti - lpm ) in optical interferometers can be enhanced by a spectral shift of half wavelength , which can be interpreted as a half - wavelength shift of the interference pattern .<n> the result is valid for arbitrary shape of the distribution function @xmath0 , and for arbitrary distance between the plates . <n> [ [ section ] ] the concept of optical interference has been introduced by bernoulli @xcite , in the spirit of wave optics , to describe the interference of two optical beams under the action of some external field . in the same spirit , it is natural to expect that interference effects between two beams should be anti - stationary , i.e. , they can not be reversed by some external force . as it is well - known , that is , when the forces acting on the beams differ from each other in such a way that the total force is zero , then the interference between the beams vanishes . on the other hand ,<n> it is also known that if the forces are equal to each other , there is a counter - interference effect , namely , if two beams are decoupled  we derive a general expression for the scattering amplitude in the limit of a large angle of incidence , valid for arbitrary scattering geometry .<n> the result is applied to the problem of coherent x -

induced phase transition . for large velocities<n> , the pressure changes as @xmath0 , where @xxmath1 is the velocity of the gas , and the volume changes as an inverse - square - root - of - the - velocity . <n> the thermodynamics of a relativistic gas of quarks and antiquarks is a problem of central importance in nuclear and condensed matter physics , as well as in statistical mechanics @xcite . in this problem<n> the energy density , pressure , chemical potential , entropy and other quantities change as a result of interactions between the quarks , an effect known as the qcd - qcd phase transition ( ptpt ) . since the phase transition is a first - order transition in the mean - field theory , it is we study the thermalization of a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms confined in an optical trap .<n> we show that the condensate undergoes a continuous thermalization as a function of the trap intensity , starting from a temperature - independent steady state . at low temperatures ,<n> the condensate decays exponentially , while at high temperatures it undergoes a power - law decay with an exponent that depends on the number of atoms . <n> bose einstein condensation ( bec ) is one of the most important quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite . in bec<n> , a condensate of bosons , each of which is an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order parameter , condenses into a state that is a superposition of condensates of different bosonic states . for a system confined in a trap , this superposition state<n> is called a _ condensate_. in this paper , we study a system in which the bosons of the condensate interact with each other , and the interaction between the bosonic condensate and the trap is assumed to be short - ranged , with a range of the order of a few times the trap radius . we show in this paper it is shown how quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can be turned into a euclidean statistical field theory ( sft ) suitable for studying the dynamical properties of a many - particle system .<n> it is also shown how to use the statistical formalism of qcd to study the structure of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in this<n> setting , the qgp is shown to be a strongly interacting many - body system , where the dynamical degrees of freedom are the quarks and gluons , and the interaction between them is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 . <n> it has been known for a long time that the qcd interaction can not be described in terms of only one distribution function , i.e. , that it depends on many distribution functions , but it can be described by including all the distribution functions in a perturbative way @xcite . however , it is not clear how to make such an an assumption in the framework of minkowski quantum field theory , which has been so successful in describing the chromo - magnetic ( cm ) and chromo - electric ( ce ) effects . here<n> we will a quantum field theory in euclidean space - time is constructed using a generalization of the chern - simons - hilbert action .<n> it is shown that the theory is dual to a statistical field theory , in the sense that the partition function is identical to the one in the standard formulation . <n> _ introduction _ it is well known that the hilbert space of quantum field theories can be divided into two regions , the low - energy and the high - energy regions . in the low energy region ,<n> the theory reduces to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , while in the high energy region it is equivalent to qcd with the cosmological constant @xmath0 as the temperature . for the description of high energy phenomena , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the qcd transition , it is important to have a theory that can be written as a superposition of these two types of theories @xcite . however , even in the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( ssm ) with gaussian gauge fields , there is a problem with the perturbative expansion of the theory : it is not possible a connection between quantum field theory ( qft ) at zero temperature and finite temperature schwinger - dyson theory ( sft)is presented .<n> it is shown that , at nonzero temperature , the partition function of the system can be written as a sum over the matsubara frequencies of the bosonic hamiltonian . as a consequence ,<n> the temperature dependence of the specific heat and the electronic compressibility is obtained . <n> pacs numbers : 71.10.fd , 71.27.+a , 05.30.fk the concept of partition function @xcite has been used to describe a large variety of physical systems , e.g. , in solid state physics and atomic physics . in particular , it has proven to be a useful tool in the study of strongly correlated systems at finite temperature ( @xmath0 ) , such as the cuprates . however , due to the large number of degrees of freedom available in these systems it is not possible to perform all calculations in the same way . instead , one needs to consider different approaches such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the recently introduced schwinger <n> dyson (  in this letter we present a general method to construct the lorentz - violating parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the standard model ( sm ) in the space - like region .<n> the method is based on the contour expansion of the pdfs in terms of their real and imaginary parts , which can be used to extract the contribution of the thermal ( anti)gluons and the vacuum . in the case of thermal gluons and vacuum , the pdf can be written as @xmath0=-im[f(omega+i0))]$ ] , such that the contribution from the gluon is reflected by the fact that it is its own antiparticle . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.st , 14.40.aq , 14.65.ha in refs . @xcite , it was shown that the sm , in its standard form , can be rewritten as a non - relativistic field theory ( nrqt ) , where the only free parameters are the energy - momentum tensor ( eft ) and the mass of the particle . as a result , there are only two free parameters we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .<n> we show that the rpa results for the thermodynamic potential and the specific heat are in good agreement with the results of the exact diagonalization ( ed ) for small systems . for large systems ,<n> we find that the ed results are in excellent agreement with perturbative calculations . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the problem of determining the properties of strongly correlated electron systems is one of the most important problems of modern condensed matter physics . in particular , it is important to understand the role played by correlations in strongly correlated materials , such as cuprates , heavy fermion compounds , and high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) @xcite . to this end<n> , many theoretical approaches have been used , including variational , hartree - fock , bogoliubov - de gennes and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite as well as numerical methods such as density functional theory ( dft ) and random - matrix renormalization group ( rmrg  we present a general formalism to calculate the polarization tensor of gluons and quarks in the presence of fermionic matter .<n> the formalism is applied to the case of an imbalanced fermi surface , i.e. , a situation in which the contributions from the different quark flavors are unequal . in this case<n> , we find that the total polarization tensor contains contributions from all the fermions , but the contribution from each flavor can not be identified . as a result ,<n> the self - energy of the gluon is a non - zero function of the three - momentum in the fermi sphere , which is a direct consequence of the non - trivial contour connecting the gluonic polarization tensor to those of quarks and anti - quarks . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.st , 13.85.qk gluons are the source of a lot of interesting astrophysical and cosmological phenomena , such as gravitational waves @xcite , gravitational waves in the earth s crust and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , as well as to fundamental problems in physics such as the origin of the electric dipole moment ( we present a method to calculate the energy spectrum of a quantum billiard .<n> the method is based on the solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpde ) , which describes the dynamics of the quantum system in the thermodynamic limit . as an example , we calculate the quantum - mechanical green s function for a quantum two - level system . <n> the energy spectra of quantum billiards ( qbs ) are of great interest because of their fundamental importance in the field of quantum information and quantum computation @xcite . in particular , they play an important role in the development of quantum algorithms and quantum simulators of quantum many - body systems , such as quantum computers , quantum algorithms for certain types of tasks , etc . recently , it has become possible to perform simulations of qbs in optical lattices , for which the dynamic range of the interactions is much larger than in the classical case , and thus the energy of the system can be much larger , compared to the classical limit , @xmath0 $ ] , where the system is in its ground state . on the other hand , the energy level structure of the billiard , i.e.  in this work , we study the effect of fermion - antifermion interactions on hole - antihole production and annihilation in heavy - ion collisions .<n> we find that these processes are strongly suppressed compared to the case of neutrino - antineutrino interactions . <n> pacs number(s ) : 25.75.-q , 13.60.hb , 14.20.dh , 13.75.cs [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite , the field of neutrino physics has been skyrocketing , and neutrino physics is now one of the most active areas of research in particle and nuclear physics . in neutrino physics ,<n> the so - called @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations @x<n> . one of these problems is the neutrinoless double beta decay , which is the most studied non - leptonic decay process . at the same time , there is a growing interest in the study of other processes involving neutrinos , such as neutrino - nucleus collisions , muon - nucleus and neutrino - electron scattering , as well as neutrinoless dilepton decay . for the latter the gluon self - energy is decomposed in terms of a matter part , a renormalized vacuum and an infinite vacuum contribution .<n> the renormalization of the vacuum contribution is discussed in detail and the vacuum expression is obtained explicitly in the case of massless quarks in the high - density limit . in the @xmath0 limit<n> the dressed gluons are massless , i.e. , they are not dressed by quark - antiquark forces . <n> the gluons of the standard model ( sm ) are described by an effective field theory ( eft ) , in which quarks and gluons interact via the higgs mechanism @xcite . due to the coupling of quarks to gluons , the sm gluons do not propagate in the vacuum and , therefore , do not have a dynamical mass . as a consequence ,<n> the sm self - energies contain an infinite number of infinite vacuum contributions , which can not be resummed . to include the dynamical properties of the gluonic field the dynamical mass has to be taken into account . here<n> , it is shown that , contrary to what is expected , there is no infinite vacuum we study the polarization of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions in the presence of a dense gas of atoms .<n> we find that , due to the interaction with the gas , the polarizations of the produced particles are strongly dependent on the initial energy of the collision . in particular , we show that the production of charged particles is enhanced in the collision of two ions of the same species , while neutral - pion production is suppressed . <n> relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments have played a key role in the development of particle physics . during the last decade ,<n> the rhic energies have been increased by more than an order of magnitude , and a new era of rhic physics is expected to begin in the next decade @xcite . at the same time , a large number of theoretical studies have been carried out to understand the properties of the relativistic particles produced in rhic collisions , including predictions of new phenomena , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which has been predicted to exist in the interior of the expanding fireball , as well as predictions of non - abelian supersymmetric ( susy ) particles , predicted to the temperature dependence of the gluon self - energy and the chemical potential of a quark - antiquark pair is studied .<n> it is found that the temperature corrections to these quantities are of the order of @xmath0 , where the first error is statistical and the second is due to the sommerfeld expansion . in the case of two quarks with equal masses , which is the case in real time , the corrections are found to be of the same order of magnitude . <n> one of the most important problems in the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the so - called confinement problem , i.e. , what is the effect of confinement on the properties of the hadrons produced in high energy collisions ?<n> it has been known for a long time that the confinement effect can not be ignored in qcd since it is the only effect which can be consistently calculated in the limit of strong coupling @xcite . on the other hand , it is also well known that strong interactions lead to the formation of a deconfined phase , in which quarks and gluons are not confined in the same way as they are in the vacuum , since they do not share the vacuum and matter properties of an ideal fermi gas are discussed in the limit of a large coupling constant .<n> it is shown that the screening of the electric and magnetic gluons is crucial to obtain the correct vacuum behavior . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.38.mh , 12.39.ba , 24.85.+p in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the understanding of the non - equilibrium dynamics of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) under extreme conditions . in particular , it has been realized that the qgp can be described in terms of a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons ( @xmath0 ) which are confined to a small volume @xcite . at the same time , the experimental evidences for the existence of a qgp in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( rhic ) at the cern - sps collider , as well as the recent measurements of the lhc energy spectrum , strongly suggest that a qcd - like phase may have been formed in the collision of au+au at rhic and in the subsequent collisions of pb+pb at lhc @x it is shown that the lorentz and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of fermions in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) give rise to a non - zero mass for the gauge bosons .<n> this is a consequence of the fact that the supersymmetric contribution to the energy momentum tensor of the theory is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling constant , @xmath0 , while the contribution of the  ideal '' fermion condensates is always negative . as a consequence ,<n> the gauge - coupling constant of the m - theory can not be expressed in terms of the product of two gauge - invariant quantities , i.e. , the fermi energy and the condensate momentum . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.pb , 12.60.jv , 03.70.+k , 11.10.kk the problem of the origin of the mass of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) gauge boson is one of the most important in modern physics . in order to understand the mechanism of the formation of the symmetry breaking , it is of utmost importance to understand how the the bose - einstein condensate and the quark self - energy are derived in the coulomb and the lorentz gauge .<n> the unphysical degrees of freedom are shown to drop out due to the ghost contribution . in the latter gauge ,<n> the non - relativistic quark propagator is shown to be given by the stefan - boltzmann law . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 14.40.aq the quarks are the only known excitations of the standard model ( sm ) . since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm quark , @xmath0 , has been one of the main puzzles in particle physics . for a long time it has been believed that the sm vacuum is stable , but this is not the case anymore . recently<n> , there has been a revival of interest in the sm , motivated in part by the experimental evidence for the existence of a non - zero higgs mass . among the candidates to explain the mass difference between the s - particle and the p - particle is the b - we present a method to determine the energy level splittings of double - quantum well systems based on the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle excitations .<n> we apply this method to the case of a double quantum well system , where the energy levels of the two quantum wells are degenerate . in this case<n> , we find that the degeneracy can be lifted due to the excitations of the second quantum well . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of systems with a large number of quantum dots ( qds ) , due to their potential applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . among the many problems that can be addressed in such systems ,<n> one of the most interesting is the formation of a quantum well ( qhd ) due to interaction of the qd with a heat bath . as a result of this interaction , the energy of the system can be split into two levels , one of which is degenerate with respect to the other one . for a given energy level , both levels are non - degenerate , and the system is described by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath0 , with the we calculate the self - energy of a quark and an antiquark in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature @xmath0 .<n> we find that in the qgp the single quark self - energies for a pair of quarks are of the same order of magnitude , i.e. , about twice as large as the vacuum contribution . as a consequence ,<n> the total quark - quark scattering cross - section at the lhc is significantly smaller than that predicted by qcd sum rules . <n> the calculation of the total scattering cross section for two quarks in a hadron - hadron collision is one of the most important open problems in high energy physics . in the past<n> many different approaches have been proposed to calculate the total cross section @xcite . among them , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , lattice qcd , and qcd with quarks and gluons in the effective theory , are the most popular methods . however , in the last few years it has become clear that , contrary to what was supposed to be the case when qcd was first formulated , there is no one -

( 2 ) opinions evolve in a random way ; and ( 3 ) all opinions converge to the same stationary value within a finite time . as such , the process has the property that it converges , in a certain sense , to an stationary state , which is a stationary process in the sense that the time it takes for a particular opinion to evolve is the same as the time required for all the other opinions to evolve . the process is called fmie ( for short ) because it is driven by consensus , i.e. by the consensus of all the opinions . in this paper , we investigate the renormalization group flow of the @xmath0 system in the space - time domain .<n> we show that , in general , the flow is non - perturbative in the sense that it can not be expressed as a perturbation series in powers of the coupling constants . as a result ,<n> the flow has a non - trivial structure , which we investigate in detail . <n> we consider two cases : ( i ) the system is perturbed by an external source , and ( ii ) it is perturbed in the same spacetime domain as the system to be studied . in both cases<n> we find a renormalized flow which is consistent with the known results . we consider a game of _ tokenization _ where each agent has a ( maybe empty ) collection ( cluster ) of @xmath0 tokens .<n> then , at each time step , each agent gives his token to another agent ;

this is known as  transience '' ( t - transience ) . the markov voter model ( m - voter in this paper , we investigate the renormalization group flow of the @xmath0 system in the space - time domain .<n> we show that , in general , the flow is non - perturbative in the sense that it can not be expressed as a perturbation series in powers of the coupling constants . as a result ,<n> the flow has a non - trivial structure , which we investigate in detail . <n> we consider two cases : ( i ) the system is perturbed by an external source , and ( ii ) it is perturbed in the same spacetime domain as the system to be studied . in both cases<n> we find a renormalized flow which is consistent with the known results . we consider a game of  settle - and - play '' in which agents attempt to trade their share of the game for a chance to win it .<n> the game is symmetric with respect to the size of the bet between the agents , the amount of money involved in the game , and the strategies of the players . <n> * introduction . * the game of settle and play ( cft ) @xcite is one of the simplest variants of the  prisoner s dilemma '' game of chance . in the cft<n> , there is an infinite number of players , called  agents '' , each of which has some ( nonnegative real - valued ) money . whenever two agents meet , they instantly play a fair game in which one agent acquires the combined money , while the other has chance @xmath0 to win all the money ; this is called a _ settle -and - play_. in this paper , we study this game from the point of view of game theory , with particular attention to the question of whether the strategy of each agent is determined by its chance of winning or not . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce a variant of the cf in this note , i give a short overview of some recent results on the evolution of multi - agent networks . in particular , the disordered limit behavior is discussed . in this note , i give a proof of a long - standing conjecture about the percolation properties of social networks .<n> the conjecture states that the spectral gap of the fpp process on a weighted graph is @xmath0 . <n> the proof involves intricate analysis , and i do not outline here the discussion here . in his thesis , pan @xcite proved the following conjecture :  on a graph , there is an upper bound on the number of connections that can be made by an agent at a time . if two agents meet , they exchange _ tokens _ , each with a different number of neighbors . on a lattice ,<n> there is a limit cycle as in the classical exclusion process ; on a complete graph the limit cycle is a markov chain , so the motion of an individual token is as a chain of markov chains , with a spectral gap which is itself a reversible chain . for a discrete time<n> , the time taken for an  epidemic '' to reach a given number of partners is called the _ percolating distance _ of the  infectives '' ; see , e.g. , @x we study the dynamics of the blume - capel model on the torus , on the lattice , and in other geometric settings . <n> blume and capel , in their seminal papers @xcite , introduced a new model of interacting particles , the _ blumecapel model _ ( bcm ) , which is  indistinguishable '' from the standard interacting particle model ( ipm ) in the long - time limit .<n> the bcm was introduced to describe the behavior of particles which are  close '' to each other , _<n> i.e. _ , particles which do not come too close to one another . in this paper<n> , we study bcm in more general geometries , including the  geometric torus '' ( lt ) and other  discrete '' geometries ( e.g. , triangular , kagome , hypercube , toroidal , etc .) . we show that bcm is _ not _ indistinguishable from the usual ipm model , even in the short - time asymptotic limit , provided that the geometry is sufficiently regular . as an application we survey stochastic processes whose basic properties have been rediscovered in recent years . our focus is on the randomly - shifted logistic limit result , proposition [ plogistic ] .<n> we give an outline taken from @xcite , though essentially the same result can be found in older genetics literature . from this one result<n> , we can read off many results like ( [ dgg], [ dgl]), a fact which has not been appreciated in the combinatorics - inspired literature , and secondly , it plays a central role is investigating fpp processes . <n> [ theorem]corollary @xmath0 ) # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) symmetries , percolation , shape theorems , fpp model , randomly shifted logistic , wlln , gauss inequalities . the random set of infectives at initial time from initial time , @x.9 , is approximately the deterministic set . for the random infected set ,<n> write @x<n> ( not written ) and for the time to traverse edge , write @math1 , where @ we study a discrete model of the _ pandemic _ epidemics of 2009 h1n1 .<n> we show that the time evolution of the epidemic can be characterized in terms of the behavior of mie processes : the proportion of a population infected at time @xmath0 , the time at which half the population is infected , and the time until all the individuals in the population are infected . <n> * key words : * epidemic model , mie process , pandemic , discrete model . *<n> _ ams subject classification : _<n> 92d30 , 92d40 , 60k37 . + _ <n> pacs numbers :_<n> 05.65.+b , 87.23.ge , 05.40.-a , 89.75.fb . in this paper , we consider a _ discrete , stochastic , deterministic , continuous _ model of an epidemic epidemic , in which we  spread _ and _ infect _ a population at random times , starting from a random initial condition . we model the epidemic as a discrete stochastic process in which , at each time step , a we study the simple epidemic model on the complete @xmath0-vertex @xcite , which is the simplest epidemic model , in the limit that the number of infected people tends to infinity .<n> we show that it is equivalent to the yule process , with transition rates that are independent of time - shift , on a complete graph . <n> [ plogistic ] for the epidemic process on the simple ( i.e. , non - integrable ) @ xy - graph , there exist random @x s such that the epidemic transition rate @ xmath1 has the gumbel distribution . for the complete graph on the other hand ,<n> there are @xxmath2 s , and one can easily write down an explicit expression for the transition rates . in particular , the time until half the population is infected has asymptotic distribution given by the yules transition rate , independent of the time shift . *<n> introduction : * epidemic models play an important role in the statistical physics of complex systems , as they are the only models that allow one to study the behavior of a large class of systems in a broad range of parameter regimes , including those that arise in we prove that the finite pandemic process ( fpp ) on a weighted graph @xmath0 has a limit process .<n> more precisely , we prove the following : * theorem ( a ) . <n> * theorem [ theorem ] . * <n> theorem ( b )<n> . for a sequence of weighted graphs ( wlln ) @xcite , the sequence of  weighted graphs with prescribed degree distributions '' ( with appropriate moments finite ) can be chosen to have the following structure : ( i ) for any sequence of ( weighted ) graphs , there is a sequence @xxmath1 , such that the mean - field limit process on the complete graph is the same as on the sequence ;

called _ weight operators _ , introduced by slepian and veselago in the context of quantum information theory in the early 1990s . the main idea is to define , for a given value of the weight , the relevant path of the corresponding folding ( see [ describefold ] for definition [ weightls ] ) , as follows : [ weight ] @ in this paper , we study the intersection properties of paths in the euclidean plane with affine hyperplanes .<n> we prove that the minimum of the function @xmath0 , which associates to each path a set of nonnegative integers , is attained at the intersection of the path with two of these planes . as a consequence ,<n> we show that the corresponding inequality is sharp . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ [ background ] ] background : [ [ introduction]]the main purpose of this paper is to study the intersections of certain paths in a euclidian plane . in @xcite , by means of the riemann - hilbert problem , it is proved that the intersection between a path and a plane is a _ nontrivial _ intersection , if and only if the path has a non - empty interior . the proof is based on the fact that this intersection is a nontrivial extension of the intersection with a plane , provided that the path does not pass through the plane ; in other words , the result is also valid for paths that lie in the plane but do not intersect it . for more information on the existence of we construct a family of paths that converge to linearly supersymmetric ( ls ) chains , and we show that ls chains can be viewed as a special case of our construction .<n> we also show that the minima of the paths associated to the limits of our paths are integers . <n> the construction of paths with a fixed number of steps was first introduced by littelmann in @xcite , under the assumption that the minimum of each path converges to a ls chain . in this paper , we extend this construction to the case where the minimum is also a path . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce a new family @xmath0 of paths , which converges uniformly to paths in our family , as well as to a large class of paths in the combinatorics of the folded paths . as in the case of paths<n> , the directions of the new paths coincide with those of the old paths ; and , therefore , our construction can be regarded as a limiting case of a special construction , in the sense of kashiwara , based on the results of lakshmibai @x<n> .

on the other , the problem of finding a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure of a discrete lattice has attracted a lot of attention in the field of dynamical systems . in this paper<n> , we consider a natural generalization of the problem to lattices of higher codimension , namely , to codimensions that are at most one . for this generalization , it is natural to associate to each path on the lattice a set of points on the faces of the lattice that are obtained ( in the obvious way ) from the corresponding litt in this note , we give a definition of root operators for admissible subsets / admissible foldings , which is based on the paths corresponding to any @xmath0-chain .<n> we also give a general definition of littelmann paths that can be used to obtain such operators . <n> root operators play an important role in the study of dynamical systems . in @xcite<n> , it was shown that root operators can be defined on paths that are admissible as subsets of a dynamical system , and that they can be also defined on left - continuous maps ( which are piecewise - constant maps on paths ) . as a consequence ,<n> one obtains the notion of a path that is _ admissible _ as a subset of an admissible folding , or as a path with a root operator that is admissible as a folded path . the main purpose of this note is to give a model for root operators on paths and foldings that is more general than the one given in the introduction . we show that the @xmath0-chain on the weyl group of the bruhat order can be retrieved as a subchain of a certain saturated chain on the corresponding bruhat group . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an upper bound for the hausdorff dimension of the irreducible representation of this saturated chain . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] in @xcite , we derived a lower bound on the  size '' of the representation of the saturated bruhat chain in terms of  admissible subsets '' , i.e. , subsets that can be extracted from the action of an admissible operator . in this paper<n> we compute the weight of each admissible subset , and hence the size of the corresponding representation .<n> this leads to an expression for the character of the operator in the corresponding sum over admissible foldings , as well as to a bound on its  volume '' . to obtain this result<n> we first show that there are six saturated chains , starting at the identity , in the bru hat order on the respective weyl groups . for each such chain<n> we retrieve the corresponding subchain , from which we are able to compute the character as a let @xmath0 be the set of indices of bouncing steps in the path of an affine coxeter arrangement .<n> we prove that @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ] proposition [ proposition ] definition [ proposition]conjecture [ proposition][ proposition]example @=11 addtoresetequationsection normalsizesetsizexiipt plus3pt minus3pt@ plus3.5pt minus0pttwosidetrue <n> @=12 # 1 # 1 = by60 = # 1bsphack@filesw gtempaauxout gtempbtempa @nobreak esphack eqnlabel vacuum # 1 <n> = cmss12 = cmu10 scaled1 # 1([#1 ] ) = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmr10 scaled3 = cmti10 scaled4 = cmmi10 scaled5 = cmtt10 scaled6 = cmmib10 scaled7 = mtmib7 scaled8 = = = @#1#1@#1 @@#1#1#1 # 1@xmath9 ) # 1#2#1 # 2 # 1#1 | # 1| # 1 | #",

main]the problem of identifying the parents of an equal - length sequence is a fundamental open problem in evolutionary biology . in order to address this problem ,<n> we have recently introduced the notion of the _ genetic distance _ @xcite , which quantifies the degree to which an individual s sequence is identical to its parents sequence . for example , it is well - known that the distance of a single parent sequence to its parent sequence is equal to the distance between the two sequences in the parent sequence we study the distribution of alignments on pedigrees under two models of recombination and mutation . in _ , we assume that sequences evolve on a pedigree under a process of recombinations without mutations .<n> we determine the pedigree uniquely ( i.e. , up to isomorphism ) - with or without the knowledge of the size or the depth of the pedigree or the various probability parameters defining the recombination and mutations , with and without restrictions such as discrete generations or constant population , and so on . <n> we also study the case of diploid pedigrees , given a pairing of extant vertices along with a distribution on alignments . we study a simple model of a cell dividing into four haploid gametes , each receiving one of the four chromosomes .<n> the exchange of material between the cell and the receiving cell creates four chromatids ( chiasma ) , which are the four strands of the cell after the exchange . at each recombination , a strand from the first pair and one from the second pair are chosen randomly with equal probability , independent of other chiasma<n> . then the cell undergoes two cell divisions to create four four chromosome haploid games . <n> _ ( _ recombination points _ ) in the diagram , there are three recombination events . the first recombination is between strands 1 and 3 ( counted from top to bottom ) and the second between strands 2 and 4 , and the third between strands 3 and 4. _<n> model rm : _ consider three sequences @xmath0 of length @math1 , where the first two are obtained by recombining two sequences , one from each of which contains the recombination points of chiasmata @xcite . here<n> we present two models : model r , in which the locations of recombinations are modelled as a poisson we study a process of recombinations and mutations on the state space @xmath0 , where each state is independently and uniformly randomly assigned to a parent vertex in a directed forest of a pedigree .<n> this is a variant of the well - known random assignment process . <n> [ [ section ] ] recombinations are ubiquitous in recombination - mutation processes , in which a sequence of states is obtained from two other sequences by recombinations of the same sequence , and by mutations of the different sequences . in this paper , we study recombinations on the _ state space _ , which is the set of states obtained from a sequence by a recombination or a mutation of another sequence . for recombinations ,<n> the probability of finding a state different from a given state is a function of the distance between the states , while for mutations , the probability is the same for each state being assigned to the same state . here<n> we investigate the process of assigning a state to an individual by randomly assigning the state to the parent vertex of that component in a spanning forest , or to the founder or the root vertex of the component in an directed forest . we show that the probability that a state is assigned to an we present a reversible model of mutation that is a synthesis of two earlier models : r and m . in this model ,<n> a state @xmath0 is assigned to a site @xcite randomly , and the state evolves away from the root in each component .<n> we call this process _ model rm_. we show that the sequence of states evolving on a _ pedigree _ , that is , a set of sequences evolving on the same sequence on a given set of sites , converges to a character distribution on the leaves of the tree constructed from the leaves . <n> the convergence of sequences of length less than or equal to the tree leaves is called _ convergence on a pedigree_. the convergence rate of the character distribution is the rate at which the number of leaves in the tree grows to infinity as a function of the size of the trees . for a directed tree , this rate of growth is given by the gaussian distribution , whereas for an undirected tree it is by the log - normal distribution . as a consequence , for a given population of trees , the tree size is proportional to the population size , rather than the square root of the diameter . we consider the problem of identifying alignments of spanning forests , directed and undirected spanning forest sequences , spanning forests of length @xmath0 , and other objects , such as undirected undirected directed spanning forests and spanning forests that are invariant under recombination events .<n> we give sufficient conditions for the identifiability of alignments . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] identification of objects is one of the most fundamental problems in probability theory . in the case of probability theory<n> , it is important to characterize the classes of objects that are associated with an object , ( i.e. , the objects that can be described by an _ object _ ) , which are _ identifiable _ under a given probability model . for instance ,<n> if the objects in a given class are isomorphism classes , then they are said to be identifiable under the model in which they are defined . on the other hand , if the _ objects _ in the class are unisomorphic , they are called _ pedigrees _ and they are identifiable under a different probability model that is defined , for example , on the basis of the class in question  we consider directed directed @xmath0-forests , hidden markov models ( hmms ) , and pedigrees of arbitrary size .<n> we define the notion of identifiability of a sequence of alignments on the space of sequences as well as stronger notions of identification , such as class and pedigree . we show that hmm models are identifiable if and only if the sequence of observed alignments can be interpreted as a pedigree on which the sequence has evolved . <n> we also show that if the size of a pedigree is fixed , then the class and the pedigree size ( typically defined by the number of observed states ) can be estimated from the model parameters . for the case of a directed forest ,<n> the class of all pedigrees is identifiable , but the class can not be identified with the set of known alignments . in the hmm setting , we are able to identify any pedigree of any size with model parameters that are the same as those of the model r and rm on the pedigree , provided that the observed states are in a set of hidden states that are at least as large as the observed state of the rm . on the other hand , for a pedigree of we introduce a new model of hidden markov models ( hmms ) .<n> the models are time - homogeneous markov chains on undirected forests . <n> [ prop - ngt ] let @xmath0 be an undirected forest sequence , for example , a spanning forest sequence with parents at the extant vertices of a pedigree . then the probability that a vertex is in an alignment is given by the sequence . in particular , it does not depend on the number of times the sequence was introduced in the pedigree , i.e. , @xcite . we define a new markov chain , called a _ markov forest _ , which is a natural extension of the hmm , in which the probability distribution on the locations of the vertices depends on the history of the family of pedigrees , rather than on the length of the forest , as in the case of the standard hmm with directed or undirected sites . the model we introduce , denoted by @ x , is a generalization of the model introduced by saffman , leclerc and maldacena ( smm - lpm ) for the case when @x we show that the frequency of character overlaps between two sequences in an alignment can be used to distinguish most diploid pedigrees of depth 2 .<n> more precisely , if two pedigrees have the same number of undirected @xmath0-forests of each type , then the character frequencies in alignments alone are not sufficient to distinguish the two lineages . but it turns out that , under model r and model r.m . <n> , most dipoids of depth two are easily distinguished by making pairwise comparisons between extant sequences and computing the probability that they agree at a site . moreover , such a probability can be computed easily under models r and rm . as a consequence ,<n> most pedigrees with depth 2 can be easily distinguished . in this paper , we study the character overlap frequencies between two sets of sequences in alignment . for a set of sequences with the same transition probabilities in all directions , the frequencies in all possible alignments<n> can be given in terms of the transition probabilities of the sets of characters . then , for a given set of transition probabilities , there is a natural way to compute the frequency that two sequences of characters agree at an undirected site of the we present a new approach to the identification of the evolutionary connection between two sequences of sequences .<n> it is based on the assumption that the sequences are in the same state at a site and that they are not related as in the haploid pedigree . as an application<n> , we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between haploid and triploid genomes . <n> _ introduction : _ it is well - known that the sequence of sequences @xmath0 from a single nucleotide sequence ( snt ) to a sequence of nucleotides ( nss ) from a haploid or triploid genome is invariant under time reversal @xcite , and that the state of the sequence at each site is determined by the state at that site . in general , the probability that two sequences have the same nucleotide at the same site is 1 or 2 , respectively , provided that the nucleotides are from the same parent . for sequences from different haploids ,<n> the probability is even less . on the other hand , for triploid sequences , _<n> i.e. _ , sequences from two different snts are not invariant , but we present a new method to identify diploid pedigrees of arbitrary depth under model r .<n> the method is based on the identification of the subpedigrees of order 2 in the crossover probabilities . as a consequence<n> , we obtain a new class of diploid crossover models , which we call diploid r - models . <n> [ [ section ] ] diploid recombination models ( drms ) have been used extensively in recombination analysis , especially as a tool to study the recombination dynamics of @xmath0-mutation , as well as recombination - recombination , recombination - exchange , and recombination - mutation models @xcite . in this paper<n> we present the first step in a general method to construct diploid models of any given depth under r , based on a new identification result for diploiddrms of depth 2 in model r. in particular , this result allows us to construct new diploid drm -

lineage trees , and to estimate the number of individuals in a family that have passed through several common ancestor(s ) @xcite . here , we present a new method for analysing alignments that is more general than previous ones , which may be applied to a wide variety of sequences , including sequences that have not been previously analysed in this way . our method is based on finding long segments of well chosen alignments ( or sequences ) , in which the recombinations have occurred , that have more probability of evolving on a particular tree than on any other tree or sequence of trees or sequences of trees . we state in a form suitable for our application we show that maximum likelihood reconstruction of phylogenetic trees is possible for @xmath0-forests in a pedigree if the number of edges on each edge of the phylogenetic tree is bounded by a positive real number . <n> the maximum likelihood approach is a popular method to reconstruct phylogenetic trees @xcite . in this approach ,<n> the goal is to find the most likely sequence of sequences of characters to sequence to a given sequence of amino acids , and to reconstruct the sequence of characters from this sequence .<n> one of the main difficulties in maximum likelihood methods is the following : first , one has to establish the identifiability of the reconstructed sequences of amino acid sequences , which is an open problem in phylogenetics . here<n> , we solve the problem by first defining a new class of trees , called phylogenetic _ forests _ , in which the state at any extant vertex is specified in a finite number of characters in a prescribed number of consecutive states . as a corollary of our result<n> we obtain a statistical consistency result : given any phylogenetic tree , there is a maximum likelihood method that reconstructs all phylogenetic forests with site pattern probabilities arbitrarily close to the site pattern probability for the phylogenetic forest , provided that the number we consider random alignments on trees , and obtain statistical consistency results for maximum likelihood . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] random alignment is a process in which a random variable is chosen at random from a list of possible alignments .<n> an alignment is said to be _ true _ if the site pattern frequency of the random variable does not exceed a certain value . in this paper<n> , we consider the problem of finding the statistical consistency of a random alignment , which is defined as the probability that an alignment has the same site pattern frequencies at all points in its open ball of radius @xmath0 centred at a given point . here<n> the _ fractional pattern frequencies _ , i.e. , the fraction of columns of the alignment of type a in the open ball , are defined . we show that if the sites of a distribution of fractional patterns are chosen uniformly at random , then the probability of finding an alignment that is true is asymptotically equal to the probability in the case that the sites are chosen randomly at random according to the fractional site pattern pattern frequencies of the distribution of types a , b , c , d , e , f , g , we give bounds on the @xmath0-norms of i.i.d . <n> bernoulli random variables , i.e. , characters , that are necessary and sufficient to ensure that an undirected forest is separated from a directed forest by a non - intersecting set of site pattern probability vectors .<n> we also give bounds in terms of an alignment parameter , which we prove using bernstein s inequality , and an upper bound on the number of distinct characters that are needed to ensure the separation . as an application<n> , we show that if we fix the size of a site pattern vector , then there is always a forest that is not separated by an open ball of the same radius . in this case , the set of sites that can be reached by a random walk on the line is bounded by that set . *<n> introduction. * it is well -

positive integers that are required to make the sequence at least as long as possible ? let @xmath0 be a hidden markov model ( hmm ) with transition matrix@xmath1 and initial distribution @xcite .<n> we prove that if the system is in a regime of strong non - markovianity , in which the markov chain is invariant under time reversal , and if the state of the system at the end of the time reversal is the same as the state at the beginning , then the hmm exhibits a phase transition to a markov process . <n> ./style / arxiv -

analogue of a classical markov chain @xcite : the sequence evolves on a subspace @x , which is we introduce a family of stochastic processes in which random alignments are added to a spanning forest to account for recombinations among the long - lived alignments .<n> we call this process _ random alignment recombination_. we show that the probability that a random alignment is added to an undirected spanning forest is a power of the distance between the first two sites to the end of the forest , and that the distance is a function of the number of alignments added . as an application<n> , we demonstrate that a simple monte carlo algorithm can be used to determine the optimal distance between two alignments for a given number of recombination events . <n> random alignment ( ra ) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biology , chemistry , engineering , physics and even planetary sciences @xcite . in the simplest version of ra ,<n> a population of individuals evolves on a forest @xmath0 , where each individual is assumed to have evolved on at least one other individual s forest . if the population size is sufficiently small , then all individuals on the forest are equally likely to evolve on the same forest ; otherwise , all individuals have the same probability of evolving on all the forests in the population . on the we construct hidden minimal models ( hmms ) with full identifiability , but only if we can count certain types of _ walks _ on the automaton with vertices labelled by undirected spanning forests . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / + + _ introduction .<n> _ _ the study of hidden automata is central to the understanding of both discrete and continuous variables @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider hidden minimal automata with transition probabilities given by concatenating alignments of length @xmath0 ( for a suitably large set of parameters ) , and with states labelled by _<n> walks_. in other words , our main result is that these automata are _ labelled _ ( up to relabelling of hidden states ) if and only if they have a pedigree given by an automaton with the same transition probabilities as the one we consider . the problem of identifying the automaton<n> is then a purely combinatorial problem . here<n> we present some results , including the first construction of a labelled hmm with fully identifiable transition probabilities and a proof that the hmm is _ not _ indistinguishable from a we study the hidden markov model ( hmm ) , a model of self - assembly in which the self - assembling phase of a molecule is generated by a recombination process . in this paper<n> , we consider the hmm in the case where the number of recombinations at each site is @xmath0 .<n> we show that the probability of hmm formation is dominated by a single parameter , which we explicitly compute . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem)proposition [ theorem][ theorem]conjecture [ theorem * hidden markovian models * + + + , _ i.e. , markov processes _ , + is one of the most studied topics in statistical physics , with applications in a variety of fields , including molecular biology , statistical mechanics , and high energy physics . a well -

to - light ratios intermediate between those of galaxies and rich clusters .<n> the majority of velocities fall within a roughly gaussian distribution of standard deviation ( the sharp peak at zero velocity results from the use of the median ) , with a flat component which contains about 25% of the total number of galaxies . <n> a large fraction of galaxies which are not physically related to the group will appear projected on the group by chance . a large number of  discordant '' galaxies , projected by chance on the groups , can account for a significant fraction of the velocity dispersion . in addition , many independent studies have found significant differences between galaxies in loose groups and those in other environments . these are examined in section 5 , and<n> are found to be consistent with the following trends : ( 1 ) galaxies with spectral types later than m@xmath1 are found preferentially in the most massive groups ; ( 2 ) there is a significant difference in the spatial distribution of late - type galaxies between groups and their neighborhoods ; and ( 3 ) the distribution of galaxies we present a study of the ellipticities , shapes , luminosity functions , spatial distribution and luminosities of 97 shakhbazian compact groups . after removing galaxies whose velocities differ from the group median by more than 1000 km s@xmath0 , we find that the mean mass - to - light ratio of the hcgs is @xmath1 ( solar units ) .<n> this value is similar to that found by hickson et al ( 1992 ) and lynds et al(1991 ) for hcgs in the virgo cluster . <n> the mean velocity dispersions of the galaxies in the groups are on the order of 2000 km _ <n> rms _ and the luminosity functions are consistent with a random distribution of galaxies with a dispersion of @xcite . however , the luminosity function for the groups is more extended than would be the case for a random galaxy distribution with the same dispersion . for a fixed velocity dispersion ,<n> the luminosity distribution can be described by a broken power - law with indices of the form @x , where @x<n> is the power index of a random projection of the total luminosity function , and the break index is equal to we present the results of an automated search for groups in the redshift range @xmath0 .<n> the groups were selected from a blank field in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and have magnitudes and colors consistent with their being virialized loose groups . <n> the search method used to find the groups was a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm , which produced a list of groups with a high probability of being real groups , as opposed to chance alignments within loose groups ( palumbo et al 1993 , apj , 462 , l1 , r4 , n1 )<n> . the final list included vv 172 ( a1656 ) and ngc 6240 ( a2656 + ic 664 ) as well as vv 162 ( vv 114 , c1656 + c2 ) which was selected on the basis of its redshift . for the complete sample ,<n> we have searched for groups with magnitudes brighter than v@xmath1 . in total , we have found 371 groups with redshifts , velocity dispersions @ the correlation between the morphological type of a galaxy and some other property of the group it belongs to is the strongest such correlation found to date ( white 1990 ) .<n> it is also well established that compact groups are more likely to contain galaxies of a similar type ( early or late ) than would be expected for a random distribution of group properties . a given compact group ,<n> however , may contain more late - type ( gas - rich ) galaxies , and they tend to be more luminous . <n> this paper shows that such a correlation results from a correlation between velocity dispersion @xmath0 and late type galaxy type , as found for the hcgs and scgs ; it also shows that higher velocity dispersions contain fewer late type galaxies ( gas rich , gas poor ) and they are more luminous<n> . this effect could be due to velocity dispersion , in addition to apparent local density , being more fundamental than apparent physical density in the formation and evolution of galaxies in compact groups , than is apparent density . as an example , it is shown that the velocity dispersion found by mendes de oliveira et al ( preprint ) for h@xmath1 rotation curves of the hcg spiral we present an analysis of the galaxy luminosity function in compact groups .<n> we find that the luminosity function of compact groups is similar to that of field and cluster galaxies , with a slight increase in the faint end at intermediate luminosities ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) . <n> galaxies within compact groups are on average brighter than galaxies in other environments having the same effective radii , absolute magnitudes and colors , but they do not lie on the fundamental plane defined by other galaxies . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we have computed the luminosity function of compact galaxies in order to address two apparently conflicting results .<n> first , we find that the schechter parameters @xmath0 , where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic , respectively , and the third error is due to the uncertainty in the redshift distribution , are consistent with that of field galaxies . <n> second , the luminosity functions that we obtain for the rscgs and the hcgs are consistent in the same sense as that of the standard calculation of mendes de oliveira & hickson ( 1991 ) . however , they are not consistent with those of sulentic & rabaa ( 1994 ) or , more recently , barton et al ( 1996 ) in the sense that they are deficient in faint galaxies within compact groups . in particular , their luminosity functions are inconsistent with those obtained for the hcg catalog by prandoni et al(1994 ) and by ribeiro et al(1 , 2 ) because of their treatment of the selection effects of the hcg sample . # 1 # 2 _ mem . soc . astron . a _ * # 1 *  the redshift - selected rscg sample shows mild evidence for a faint galaxy deficiency .<n> while the faint end of the lf in compact groups appears to be depleted , there is evidence that the bright end may be enhanced . the ratio of far - infrared - to - optical luminosity is found to be greater in compact group galaxies , compared to that of isolated galaxies .<n> this conclusion is based on a study of 40 galaxies in the hickson et al ( 1989 ) catalog which was based on iras data . to test the veracity of this result<n> , we have re - analyzed the 40 data and find that the result is robust . <n> the infrared galaxy in the compact group is identified on the basis of its mid - infrared to radio continuum emission ratio : it is a seyfert 2 galaxy with an extremely red infrared color ( @xmath0  rangle = -1.1 $ ] ) . we present the results of a survey of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) emission in a complete sample of 92 iras - selected compact group spiral galaxies .<n> the galaxies were selected from the redshift distribution of the nearby cluster ellipticals ( menon et al 1996 ) . <n> neutral hydrogen is predominantly due to supernova remnants ( snr ) and is thus related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxy . in general ,<n> compact group galaxies show higher neutral hydrogen luminosities than their isolated counterparts . however , in a few cases the difference is an order of magnitude or more , suggesting that the nuclear regions of these galaxies may be responsible for the bulk of the emission , rather than being the source of most of the nonthermal radiation . for a subsample of 15 galaxies<n> we have obtained a uniform set of observations at 1.4 ghz , 3.5 , 4.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0 ghz in order to investigate the correlations between the observed fluxes and the physical properties of the galaxies , such as the presence of agn , star formation , or both . the main results are : 1 ) we find that the compact group early - type galaxies in compact groups are found to be preferentially first - ranked optically . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we have obtained deep @xmath0 ccd images of the compact groups vv 172 , ngc 6946 , and ic 348 , in order to search for diffuse light and cool gas .<n> diffuse light may be associated with the compact quartet of early - type galaxies in vv172 , but is unlikely to be the result of tidal stripping . <n> we have also obtained deep images of ic348 and hcg 55 which do not show any evidence of diffuse light . in these two groups , diffuse light<n> can be clearly seen in the near - infrared ( nir ) images , while no diffuse light is detected in the optical ( near - ir ) data . x - ray observations of hot gas in clusters of galaxies can reveal the amount , distribution , temperature and metallicity of the gas , as well as the relative amount and distribution of the total gravitating mass . temperature , metallicity ( fraction of solar abundance ) , and bolometric luminosities are estimated by fitting a spectral model , such as that of raymond & smith to the data . however , this result is based on normalizing the flux by the optical area of the galaxy , rather than by the infrared luminosity and may be biased by the relatively small sizes of compact - group galaxies .<n> further co studies , currently in progress , should soon settle this question . ponman et al ( 1996 ) detected diffuse x - ray emission in at least 75% of the x - rays detected from compact groups of galaxies .<n> the physical properties of the detected systems span a wide range , but that the ratio of gas - to - stellar mass is significantly lower than in rich clusters . in contrast ,<n> they detected diffuse emission in several spiral - rich groups , and show that these systems are dominated by dark matter . the properties of the x - ray - emitting gas in nearby ( @xmath0 mpc ) compact groups of galaxies are reviewed .<n> these groups are of particular interest because of their high baryon fraction , which is dominated by dark matter , and because of the relatively low metallicity found for the gas . <n> # 1to 0pt#1 galaxies : clusters : individual ( ngc 2300 , hcg 51 ) x - rays : galaxies iovino & hickson ( 1996 ) combined observational results from both the hcg and scg catalogs with monte - carlo simulations . their technique exploits the unbiased nature of the scg catalog and the complete redshift coverage of the hcg sample .<n> they conclude that for all except the two highest - surface - brightness quintets ( stephan s quintet and seyfert s sextet ) , the number of discordant redshifts is consistent with chance projections . however , for both of these systems there is independent physical evidence that the discordant galaxies are at the cosmological distances that correspond to theirredshifts and are therefore not group members . the physical properties of galaxies in compact groups are consistent with a cosmological distance , and do not require a new interpretation of galaxy redshifts . in this paper , we review the evidence for and against associations and high density in compact group galaxies .<n> we discuss the frequency of physical association , the high frequency of interacting galaxies , x - ray emission , physical associations , bound dense configurations , chance alignments , filaments seen end - on and transient configurations . <n> # 1to 0pt#1 psfig.sty in this paper we discuss the possible systematics that may bias the sample of groups selected on the basis of high apparent density .<n> we also show how the apparent density of compact groups may be biased . <n> # 1to 0pt#1 @xmath0 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present a study of the spatial distribution of shakhbazian groups in the local universe .<n> this study is based on a sample of groups selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , covering the redshift range @xmath0 . <n> we find that the spatial distributions of the groups in this sample are quite different , with some groups being more centrally concentrated than others , and some not at all . in particular , there is a clear overdensity in the central regions of some groups , which we interpret as a sign of ongoing infall of galaxies from the environment into their overdense cores . on the other hand ,<n> the distribution of groups is not significantly different from that of individual galaxies , nor is the overdensity distribution of triplets , quartets and pairs , suggesting that triplets and quartets are not distinct entities in the galaxy clustering hierarchy , but rather an intermediate stage between loose groups and triplets and pairs and individual galaxies ( ebeling et al 1995 , cavaliere et al 1991 , rampazzo & sulentic 1992 , diaferio et al 1994 ) both n - body and hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the dark matter halos of individual galaxies merge first , creating a massive envelope within which the visible galaxies move ( barnes 1984 , bode et al 1993 ) . kinematic studies of loose groups ( eg . puche & carignan 1991 )<n> indicate that in most compact groups , the gas and dark matter is more extended and is decoupled from the galaxies .<n> this may explain the observation that galaxies in compact groups typically have mass - to - light ratios 30% to 50% lower than more isolated galaxies ( rubin et al 1991 , zheng et al 1994 , del olmo et al 1995 ) and thus appear to be mostly small clusters , possibly intermediate in physical properties between classical compact groups and clusters . if the groups are dynamically bound , galaxy mergers should commence within a few dynamical times . in this paper , i review the current status of merging galaxies in compact groups . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present the results of a search for hii regions in three @xmath0-band selected groups of galaxies : hcg 31 , hcg 44 , and hcg 54 .<n> we find hi in extended hi clouds in two of the groups , but not in the third . <n> # 1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we have searched for compact groups of galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 in the hydra cluster ( hcg ) using hst .<n> we have found several examples of compact groups containing both agn and starburst galaxies . <n> the comoving number density of agn in these regions is found to be high ( at least 10 objects per comoving mpc@xmath1 ) , consistent with the expectation that most agn are associated with compact groups at high redshift . at the redshift of these objects ,<n> there is a strong tendency for the agn to lie within the compact groups , suggesting that this association extends to qsos . in this model disk<n> , it is expected that there should be a strong correlation between the number of compact agn , starburst galaxies and agn at high - redshift ( e.g. bahcall et al 1997 , hutchings et al 1995 , pascarelle et al 1996 , matthews et<n> al 1994 , and tsuboi & nakai 1995 )<n> . however , at this redshift there is no clear evidence for a large number of close agn or starburst galaxies in the hcg we present results from a search for galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the hicks clump ( hcg 90 ) using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> we have found a total of @xmath0 galaxies in a 1 square degree region centered on the brightest galaxy of the group , ngc 6946 , plus an additional 4 galaxies in close proximity to it . <n> the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in this region is well - fit by a schechter function with a mean luminosity of log(l@xmath1 ) = 16.0 , which is close to the lf of present - day compact groups of galaxies ( duc & mirabel 1994 , schade et al 1995 )<n> . however , there is a significant excess of faint blue galaxies which may be dwarf galaxies undergoing star formation at a redshift of 2 - 3 . from the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for this region<n> , we have identified a large population of blue galaxies with a luminosity - to - light ratio ( l / l ) greater than 8.6 , and a small population of red galaxies with an l /l less than during the last two decades we have seen a resurgence of interest in compact groups . while initially little more than a curiosity , these systems are now viewed as potentially important sites of dynamical evolution , shaping the structure of many galaxies .<n> they form by gravitational relaxation processes within looser associations of galaxies , and are generally in an advanced stage of evolution characterized by strong interactions , starburst and agn activity , stripping of stellar and dark matter halos , or merging . they contain large amounts of dark matter and primordial x - ray - emitting gas trapped within the gravitational potential well . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in it is shown that the baryonic matter distribution in the milky way s halo can be described in terms of amirkhanian geometry , but with a different form of the baryon fraction , @xmath0 , than that of the ism .<n> this result is based on the observation that the local density of baryons in the galactic halo is much higher than the critical density , required for the formation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from the gas ejected by quasars during their formation . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in the formation and evolution of the igm has been one of the most important unsolved problems in modern astronomy . in the last decade<n> , there has been an enormous observational progress in the field , both observationally and theoretically , with the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the next generation of ground - based observatories , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , wide - field infrared survey telescope ( _ wise_) and very large array ( vla ) @xcite . at present<n> we present the first measurement of the gravitational acceleration of a charged compact object .<n> the acceleration of the charged particle is due to the gravitational force exerted by the earth s magnetosphere on the charged particles which are moving with the speed of light . the measured acceleration is @xmath0 . <n> the detection of gravitational accelerations of charged particles is one of the most important observational results in astrophysics @xcite . in recent years<n> , several experiments have been carried out to measure the acceleration and the gravitational lensing properties of charged compact objects @x<n> . some of these experiments are based on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , which is equipped with a high - resolution , high - accuracy interferometer @ xcite , and a very high - speed , low -ncy tracking detector @xhedron , whose detailed description can be found in refs.@xcite and references therein . however , the accuracy of these results is not sufficient to give reliable conclusions about the nature of the acceleration process . to overcome this difficulty ,<n> several methods have been proposed . among them<n> are : _ astrofizika _ @ in this paper , we study the power spectrum of the redshift - space distortions ( rsds ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies .<n> we find that the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath0 , is strongly affected by the non - gaussianity of the cmb fluctuations . in the case of a scale - invariant primordial spectrum of fluctuations ,<n> we show that the power - spectrum amplitude is strongly dependent on the primordial spectral index . for a flat universe , the primordial spectrum is of power - law form , with a spectral index in the range 1.45@xmath1 to 2.15 , depending on the value of the cosmological constant . <n> the primordial cmb power spectrum is very sensitive to the amplitude and shape of the gravitational potential , and to the shape and normalization of a primordial scalar field . at variance with the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , which is a strong gravitational effect @xcite , _<n> i.e. _ due to the large - scale structure , it is not affected by non - linearities in the scalar potential . on the other hand we present new results for the radial velocities of the brightest galaxies in the virgo cluster , based on a new set of n - body simulations with adaptive mesh refinement .<n> we find that the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which is in good agreement with the value derived from the integrated light measurements . <n> galaxies are the most luminous objects in the universe , but they are not the most compact ones . in order to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies , it is necessary to study their kinematics and dynamics . the kinematics of galaxies<n> is mainly determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , by the mass distribution of the host galaxy and by the velocity distribution of its stars . at high redshifts , _<n> i.e. _ when the hubble parameter is very large , the ism velocity distribution can be well approximated by a single power law @xcite . on the other hand , at low redshift , when the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies is very small ,<n> the eos is known to be strongly affected by in this paper , we study the galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster correlations in a sample of compact groups of galaxies ( @xmath0 ) .<n> the sample is selected from the catalogue of @xcite . <n> the galaxies in the compact groups are chosen to be isolated , undisturbed , and at least one member of the compact group is a spiral or irregular galaxy . in the galaxy sample ,<n> we find that the correlation length between galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion is a factor of 2 - 3 larger than in isolated galaxies , indicating that the galaxy formation process is more rapid in compact groups than in galaxy clusters . the velocity dispersion of a galaxy in a compact group increases with its distance from the group center , while that of a cluster increases with the cluster velocity dispersion , consistent with a scenario in which the group forms by the gravitational collapse of a large number of dwarf galaxies . we study the galaxy distribution in the central region of the cluster of galaxies ngc 6946 , which has a redshift of @xmath0 .<n> the velocity dispersion of the intracluster medium is found to be very high , about 300 km s@xmath1 , while that of the intercluster medium ( icm ) is much lower , less than 200 km , suggesting that the icm is not as dense as the cluster as a whole . <n> galaxies : clusters of galaxies ism : kinematics and dynamics <n> intergalactic medium in this letter , we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the central region of the galaxy cluster ngc 6946 .<n> the redshift of the cluster is @xmath0 , and the velocity dispersion of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , which surrounds the cluster , is log(@xmath1 ) = 2.80 . <n> the velocity field of the icm shows a bimodal distribution , with two main components , a fast component , centered on the cluster centre and separated from the main icm by a small velocity dispersion ; the second component is more closely associated with the cluster and is located at the cluster center , where it has a lower velocity dispersion than the main cluster component . the central redshift and velocity dispersion<n> are derived for the two components and for the whole cluster by fitting the data with a model of an exponential disk with a gaussian central density profile and a single velocity dispersion profile for the disk . from the central velocity dispersion and the central density ,<n> we derive the cluster age , the dynamical mass and the mass - to - light ratio for the cluster<n> . we also present the distribution of the blue galaxies in the cluster in this paper , we present the results of our spectroscopic observations of the interacting galaxy pair ngc 4486 .<n> the galaxy is a spiral galaxy interacting with a companion of @xmath0 magnitude less . <n> we have observed the galaxy with the multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , and have obtained the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the galaxy and for its companion . the galaxy , which has a total magnitude of m@xmath1 , shows a pair of tidal tails , with the galaxy closest to the center of the pair at a projected distance of 296 kpc from the center , while the companion is closer to the main body of the galaxy at a position angle of 45 degrees . at the distance of the tidal tail , the galaxy has a disk - like stellar component , as well as a blue disk component . in the spectrum of the companion ,<n> the velocity difference between the two stellar components , , is found to be in the range of 300 to 400 km / s , depending on the model used to fit the data . for we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the central region ( @xmath0 kpc ) of the galaxy ngc 4258 .<n> the redshift derived from the kinematics of the emission - line gas ( nel ) and the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas ( v@xmath1 ) shows that the galaxy is an elliptical ( s0 ) with a rotation curve ( rc ) which steepens with increasing radial distance from the nucleus . <n> the central regions of galaxies ( gns ) exhibit a variety of morphological and kinematical features , which have been intensively studied during the last years @xcite . in this paper<n> we present a study of the radial velocity distribution of the gas in the central part of a sample of galaxies selected from the _ uppsala _ catalogue of galaxies , for which accurate radial velocities ( rv ) have been measured up to redshift @x.@xcite the rvs have been derived using a new method , based on the comparison of the two -

millimeter motes for a wide range of applications .<n> this development ( and many others ) indicate that large scale , high density networks are on the horizon . a need for the synchronization of large distributed systems is very real and one that requires careful study to understand the fundamental performance limits on synchronization . in that work ,<n> models are developed to describe natural synchronization as an emergent behavior in complex networks of oscillators . <n> the second approach is to consider synchronization as a problem of critical slowing down of complex oscillators and then develop models to describe the behavior of synchronization in large networks . here<n> , we develop a new approach to the problem of time synchronization in distributed systems , which is based on the study of the performance limits of synchronization on a large , dense network . mirollo and strogatz introduced the pulse - coupled oscillators model to explain the emergence of synchrony in populations of coupled pulse oscillators .<n> a number of models have been proposed to explain synchrony , but perhaps one of the most successful and well known is the model of pulse -coupled oscillators ( pcos ) . in this paper , we present a new model of pcos that is _ biologically realistic _ , i.e. , it is a model of cardiac cells . we show that in this model , cardiac cells are able to _ synchronize _ their activity to optimize their function . <n> @xmath0corresponding email : dickman@fisica.ufmg.br in this paper , we consider tree - based synchronization ( lts ) @xcite for a network of @xmath0 charging stations ( nodes ) , each of which is connected to its own reference clock .<n> each node is assumed to be an independent oscillator with a fixed frequency . for this model , it is known that for almost all initial conditions , the behavior of every single oscillator is governed by the same function @x<n> . however , for a fully synchronous network to emerge , all oscillators need to have the same , or nearly identical , oscillation frequencies . as far as we are aware , this requirement is nearly always needed . in order to overcome this limitation and find techniques capable of synchronizing networks with nodes that have arbitrary oscillator frequencies ( clock skew ) we turn to algorithms designed to estimate certain unknown parameters such as clock offset . <n> we consider the problem of estimating a parameter such as the clock skew @x , where @math1 is the number of oscillators in the network . we show that for the class of charging stations considered , @x_n$ ] , there exists an algorithm that is provably capable of estimating @ the flooding time synchronization protocol ( ftsp ) @xcite achieves one - hop synchronization by having a root node broadcast timing information to surrounding nodes . these surrounding nodes then proceed to broadcast their synchronization information to nodes beyond the broadcast domain of the root node . this process can continue for multi - hop networks . as a result , a node multiple hops away from the node with the reference clock will be estimating its parameters from intermediate nodes that already have estimation errors . therefore , this introduces a fundamental _ scalability problem _ : as the number of hops across the network grows , the synchronization error across the networks will also grow . in this paper , we present a solution to this scalability problem based on the _ relaxed accuracy constraint synchronization _ ( s) protocol . <n> s is to reduce communication and computation requirements by taking advantage of relaxed accuracy constraints . cooperative time synchronization among the nodes of a large wireless network can be achieved through the use of spatial averaging .<n> this is a fundamentally new approach to improving network performance that has not been carefully studied . to obtain a model for developing cooperative synchronization in large wireless networks , we begin by looking at the signals observed by a node in a network with @xmath0 nodes uniformly deployed over a fixed finite area . assuming that each node s transmission is assumed to be the same for all nodes ( imperfect time synchronization is assumed ) , the basic pulse transmitted by each node is modelled as a superposition of all the pulses observed by the node . in this expression<n> , all nodes transmit a pulse @xcite , which is the superposition , in the ideal case , of all these pulses . <n> we assume random errors in the pulse transmission time are modeled as a function of the time of arrival of the pulses from all the neighbors in the network . using this model ,<n> we obtain a general expression for the signal seen at a given node in the case that the received signal is the sum of the basic pulses transmitted by all nodes . for a network of @xxmath1 nodes uniformly distributed over @x in this paper , we study the scalability of a clock synchronization network in which the nodes in the network are able to synchronize their clocks , as the size of the network grows to infinity .<n> we prove the following law of large numbers : for any @xmath0 , there exists a network of nodes that synchronizes their clocks ( in the reference time ) with bounded error as the number of nodes @xcite increases , and this holds for any size of network . <n> we also consider the case where the clock arrival time is observed at each node . in this case<n> we show the following scaling law , which also holds in the limit of infinite network size . for any fixed @x ,<n> there exist networks of nodes with the following properties : ( a ) the maximum number of clocks that can be synchronized at any given time ; ( b ) a deterministic waveform for the arrival time of the clocks ; and ( c ) an upper bound on the maximum clock arrival rate . here<n> the first two are well - known , while the last two have not been previously studied . we consider the problem of time synchronization in dense wireless networks .<n> we propose a new technique that allows for spatial averaging and has favorable scaling properties . using this technique ,<n> we show that cooperative time synchronization works perfectly for negligible propagation delay . when propagation delay is considered , we find that asymmetries at the boundaries reveal some limitations that need to be carefully considered in designing algorithms that take advantage of spatial averaging . in analyzing the proposed cooperative time synchronizing technique<n> , our goal is to show that the proposed technique can average out all random error and provide deterministic parameters for synchronization as node density grows unbounded . this asymptotic result can be viewed as a _ convergence in scale _ to synchrony . the result serves as a theoretical foundation for allowing a new trade - off between node density and synchronization performance . we propose a technique for the cooperative time synchronization of pulse - coupled oscillators in a network .<n> this technique uses spatial averaging to synchronize oscillators that have pulse arrival times that are different from the arrival times of other oscillators . <n> synchronization of oscillators is a fundamental operation in many branches of physics , engineering , social , biological , and other sciences @xcite . in this paper , we present a technique that can be used for the synchronization of nonlinear oscillators with arbitrary pulse - to - frequency waveforms , which are common in pulsed signal processing . by using spatial averaging ,<n> oscillators can be synchronized to provide a consistent timescale for each oscillator in the network , even when the oscillators have different frequencies , e.g. , oscillators coupled to a single clock @xmath0 , or oscillators which are coupled to more than one clock . for the case of no propagation delay , this technique provides a simple technique for synchronization that does not require any propagation delay at all . when propagation delay is introduced , the technique is able to provide synchronization for oscillators whose propagation time is longer than the time for synchronization of their pulse - arrival times . pulse - in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the joint probability distribution function of the transmitter , receiver , and node positions in a wireless network with random timing jitter . we are interested in estimating the probability distribution of the magnitude of the waveform observed at any given node in the network .<n> we are also interested in understanding the relationship between the random time jitter observed at a node and the random pathloss observed at that node . to solve this problem ,<n> we develop a stochastic model for timing jitter that , for asymptotically dense networks , can be used to model the random power received at a given distance from the transmitter as a function of distance . as a result<n> , the model captures the _ average _ received power as a fraction of the transmitted magnitude , which is ideal for modelling the observed aggregate waveform . <n> [ sec : intromodel ] wireless networks have become increasingly popular in recent years for a variety of applications , such as point - to - point wireless communication , distributed computing , resource allocation , communication over long distances , as well as distributed error correction @xcite . in these settings , there are a number of fundamental questions that need to be addressed  we consider the problem of distributing waveforms over a wireless network in the limit of the number of nodes @xmath0 and the total area of the network .<n> we focus on the case where the number , _<n> i.e. _ , the size , of the nodes increases linearly with the distance from the receiver , and we consider two different scenarios . in the first scenario , we assume that the nodes can be connected to each other only through a small number of edge channels . for this case ,<n> we derive the asymptotic distribution of the aggregate waveform and show that it is well approximated by a log - normal distribution , where the exponent is a function of the scaling factor . <n> wireless networks , as their name suggests , can be used to transmit and receive information over time - varying links @xcite . here , a network is defined as a set of nodes (  nodes '' ) that are connected to the rest of the world by a short - range communication channel , such as a wireless local area network ( wlan ) , or a cellular network ; a node is called a  receiver '' if it is located in the same area we present a general framework for time - delayed pulse propagation in networks with pathloss .<n> we show that time delay can be modeled as a function of both pathloss and propagation delay . using this framework<n> , we develop an efficient algorithm for pathloss estimation . <n> time delay is the amount of time that it takes for a signal to propagate a distance . in pulse propagation ,<n> both time delay and pathloss are necessary to ensure that the pulse reaches its destination . for example , if @xmath0 is a pulse sent by a node on a network , then the pulse must be sent with a time delay of at least as long as the distance between the node and the receiving node . here<n> we develop a general model for time delay in a pulse propagation network @xcite . by generalizing the definition of time delay to include a distance - dependent delay , _<n> i.e. _ , time delay as the function of distance , our general model is applicable to any network in which a pulse is transmitted over a time - dependent channel , such as a wireless local area network ( wlan ) , a cellular automaton , or a network of autonomous robots . we consider the problem of finding the minimum possible transmission delay in a given multi - hop network .<n> we consider both pathloss - only and propagation delay - only models . in the first model , we only consider pathloss , while in the second model we allow for propagation delay . for both models ,<n> we derive the distribution of the minimum delay in terms of the network parameters . <n> the main goal of this paper is to provide a framework for the analysis of transmission delays in complex networks . to this end<n> we introduce a new class of models for transmission delays , which we call _ propagation delay models _ , and we derive their exact distribution functions . as an example , in this paper we study the transmission delay distribution function of a single - hop multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) network under the assumption of pathloss only . we show that this distribution function can be decomposed into two parts , a pathloss part and a propagation delay part . the characterization of transmission delay is one of the most important open problems in network analysis . since the seminal work of shannon @xcite , propagation delay has been used to estimate the maximum transmission delay that can we introduce a model of complex networks in which delay is introduced as a deterministic function of the distance between the sender and the receiver of the transmitted signal .<n> we show that the distribution of the delay value is related to the total area of the network . using this relation ,<n> we develop a simple model for the emergence of delay in complex networks . <n> _ introduction. _ complex networks are ubiquitous in nature , engineering , society , and the financial industry . in many cases<n> , the evolution of a complex network can be described by a sequence of deterministic and random variables , such as the topology , degree of connectivity , number of nodes , delay , pathloss , etc . @xcite in this letter , we consider a special case of such networks : complex networks with delay . here , a network is defined as a set of connected components , each of which is characterized by a distance @xmath0 from the transmitter . for a signal transmitted from a node at a given distance , there is a probability that the signal arrives at the node with delay larger than some threshold value . as a result , _<n> i ) _ the in this paper , we develop a model to receive a waveform in a wireless network with both pathloss and propagation delay . we show that by using correlated delay and pathloss random variables , it is possible to accurately approximate the aggregate waveform that arrives at any node in the network .<n> we also show how to use this model to obtain a lower bound on the network capacity . <n> [ sec : intro - model ] wireless networks are increasingly being used to provide high - speed , high - data - rate communications @xcite . in such settings ,<n> it is important that the transmitters and receivers are able to communicate efficiently and accurately , and that the waveforms that are transmitted can be accurately and efficiently analyzed to extract useful network parameters . for example , in cellular networks , the transmitters must be able to accurately relay information to the receivers in order to provide data at a rate that is sufficient for data to flow from the transmitter to the receiver . as a result , there is a growing need for transmitters that can accurately relay waveforms over complex networks . to achieve this goal<n> , researchers have been developing and applying a variety of techniques to model the propagation of waveforms on complex wireless networks @x in this paper , we study the time - synchronization properties of a class of pulse - coupled oscillator networks .<n> we show that for a given number of oscillators @xmath0 , there is a maximum value of the network which can be reached in terms of the number of nodes that can be synchronized , the maximum number of pulses that can arrive at each node , and the maximum coupling strength among oscillators . <n> time synchronization is a fundamental concept in many fields , ranging from physics to biology . in biology , for example , it is important to understand how cells in the nervous system respond to changes in their environment , e.g. , changes in temperature @xcite , or changes in pressure in the solution to a problem in neurobiology , i.e. fluid vs. solid phase transitions in muscles . for the past decade<n> there has been a great deal of interest in time synchronization in biological networks , especially in the treatment of cell biology and the organization of eukaryotic cells in a time - varying environment . a particularly simple time - synchronized network is the one described by the djkj connection , in which each node in the network transmits a pulse at a constant rate , which is in a recent paper , mirollo and strogatz proposed a scheme for quantum repeaters based on pulse - coupled oscillators . in this paper<n> , we extend their model by introducing non - local correlations between the nodes .<n> we show that local correlations are a necessary and sufficient condition for the repeater to function as a quantum repeater . <n> _ introduction : _ in their recent paper @xcite mirollo & strogatze proposed a model for a network of @xmath0 nodes that can be used for quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , quantum teleportation , and quantum error correction ( qec)@xcite . to demonstrate the viability of their model , they showed that the nodes can be connected to each other by a small number of pulses and that they can operate as a single - station quantum repeater ( qsr ) even when the nodes do not have direct access to a quantum channel . as a result ,<n> the network of nodes in the model could be used as a qip device , even though it was shown to be impossible to connect all the nodes to a single qubit at once . pulse - coupled oscillators ( pco s ) provide a solution to the problem of discrete - time determinism in quantum systems .<n> we introduce a pco -estimator , defined as the function @xmath0to [ 0,1]$ ] , that quantifies the ability of a single pco to predict the behavior of many other pcos . as an example application<n> , we show that a recently introduced model of pulse - coupling of oscillators can be used to construct a clock . <n> _ introduction. _ quantum systems often exhibit discrete time , or discrete phase , in their dynamics . for example , discrete - state systems , such as atoms @xcite , ions @x , and ions in quantum dots @x<n> can have discrete phase variables , which can be represented as a superposition of phase and phase variables of the system s constituents . in quantum information processing ,<n> discrete - phase variables play a central role , as they are the building blocks for quantum computers @xxcite and for quantum repeaters and quantum logic gates . however , there is a problem with the definition of a quantum clock @x we propose a synchronization technique for phase - coherent oscillators with arbitrary coupling functions and arbitrary propagation delay .<n> we show that under certain conditions on the model , the proposed synchronization technique is asymptotically optimal . <n> synchronization of oscillators is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory . in quantum repeaters ,<n> oscillators are the nodes that transmit quantum information between each other @xcite . here<n> , we consider a network of @xmath0 nodes , each of which transmits a single waveform to the other nodes . at each node , one or more quantum bits ( qubits )<n> are encoded in the state of one oscillator , which is called an oscillator . by coupling these oscillators together , _<n> e.g. _ , by a pulse , it is possible to synchronize them . for a single - qubit network , this coupling can be modeled as a pulse - coupling between the oscillators : a pulse pushes the state variable of the oscillator to a certain value , decreasing the time until the oscillator reaches the other node . as shown in fig . [ eq : pco_estimator ] , pulse - coupled oscillators we study the problem of time synchronization in a network of nodes with arbitrary clock synchronization requirements .<n> we assume that the clock on each node is independent and identically distributed , and that all nodes in the network are subject to pathloss , i.e. , each node s clock oscillates with a frequency that is independent of time . we show that the time to synchronize a clock on any given node is bounded by the time it takes for that node to synchronize its clock with the rest of the network . <n> time synchronization is a fundamental problem in many areas of science and engineering @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider time synchronization of two types : ( i ) time - synchronous and time - desynchronized clocks ; and ( ii ) synchronization of clocks that are not time - synchronized . for the time - synchronization problem ,<n> we develop a new technique , called timesynchronization , that is based on pulse connection functions . the pulse connection function @xmath0 is defined in terms of the pulse durations , or pulse widths , of the input pulses , which are time - sampled from the output pulses . here , a pulse connection in this work , we propose a network - wide synchronization technique that is steady - state , i.e. , each node in the network synchronizes its pulse at the ideal transmit time , but suffers some random timing offset . we show that our proposed technique and its associated pulse - connection function give us the desired network properties . <n> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg , , + synchronization , pulse - transmission , jitter , multi - hop networks , pathloss , time - division multiplexing .<n> + _ jel : _ c62 , c63 , and c78 . +<n> _ note : figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version , available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2015.11.016 _ network synchronization is important for many practical applications @xcite . in this paper ,<n> we consider a network of @xmath0 nodes where each node wants to synchronize its pulse to the node it is communicating with . here<n> , a node transmits a simple pulse at exactly the time the node intends to transmit it , which is we consider a network of nodes that transmit pulses in a time - varying manner . in our model ,<n> each node transmits a single pulse at a time @xmath0 .<n> the pulses are synchronized in such a way that the arrival time of a pulse at any node is determined by the synchronized phase of the pulse at that node . for a single - pulse network , we show that there is a critical value of the number of synchronized pulses above which no pulse can be transmitted at all . above this critical value<n> , there is no node that does not receive a pulse . <n> the transmission of pulses is a fundamental process in nature , from the telegraph , through to the generation of light , to the transmission and detection of signals at astrophysical sites , such as the earth s atmosphere , the sun , and star formation regions @xcite . to fully harness the power of the electromagnetic field , however , it is necessary to transmit pulses over long distances , which means that the time scale over which pulses are to be transmitted must be time - dependent . as a result , for example , in radio - frequency communications , pulses must be transmitted over time scales that are we consider a network of nodes that seek to synchronize the time signals sent by different nodes in the network .<n> we assume that each node can send a single pulse at a time , and that pulses can be exchanged between nodes in a cooperative manner . in this paper , we present a distributed synchronization scheme that achieves asymptotic cooperative time synchronization . <n> time synchronization ( ts ) is a fundamental concept in many areas of science and engineering , such as synchronization of time signals , synchronization of clocks , time synchronization of chemical reactions , etc . for many applications ,<n> it is essential that time signals be synchronized so that they can be used to perform calculations , manipulate data , or send and receive data at the same time @xcite . to achieve this goal , in the field of information science , it is important to understand how to create synchronization pulses in a distributed system , how to use these pulse trains as a tool for the creation of time - synchronized states , as well as how to synchronize multiple synchronization pulses at different times . here<n> we present an approach to time synchronization that is asymptotically cooperative , i.e. , each node in a network synchronizes its time signals in this paper we describe a synchronization mechanism in a system of two coupled oscillators .<n> the system is described by a poisson - boltzmann equation with two parameters , @xmath0 , the mean and variance of the pulse amplitudes , which are connected to the system s instantaneous state by a pulse - connection function . in the regime of weak coupling ,<n> we show that the system synchronizes when the difference between the values of the two parameters approaches zero . <n> synchronization is one of the most important concepts in the study of synchronization @xcite and it has been used to describe synchronization in a variety of contexts , including phase synchronization , random walks , self - organized criticality , and more recently , in synchronization of two oscillators in a noisy environment . however , despite the importance of this concept , it is not clear how it can be implemented in practice , especially in the case of two - level systems . to address this issue<n> , we consider a simple model of two interacting oscillators that are coupled by a time - dependent external parameter , such as an external magnetic field . for this model , _<n> i.e. _  in this paper , we study the limiting behavior of the gaussian noise in the limit of large number of random variables . we prove that the limiting noise waveform is either an odd or a continuous function of the random variable . <n> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg , , in this work we show that deterministic parameters that allow for time synchronization can be recovered from a sequence of random variables . <n> time synchronization is a phenomenon that has been studied for many years , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in a synchronization scheme ,<n> the goal is to synchronize the time course of a system of @xmath0 non - interacting oscillators , each of which has its own behavior .<n> the simplest synchronization scheme that allows for synchronization is one where the oscillators are allowed to be deterministic , and the system is allowed to evolve in a deterministic fashion . for this scheme to work , it is essential that the deterministic parameters for the system are known . here<n> , we will show that it is possible to recover these deterministic parameters from a random sequence of non - deterministic random variables with the following property : if the random variables have a non - zero variance , then they can be used to provide time synchronization . as an example , if we have a system that is in a synchronous state and we want to recover the time - dependent deterministic parameters of this synchronization scheme then we can use random variables that have a zero mean , but possibly different variance . asymptotically dense networks ( afns ) can be used to model a wide variety of physical , biological , social , and technological systems . here<n> , we consider the problem of time synchronization in a network of @xmath0 coupled oscillators .<n> we assume that each oscillator has deterministic parameters that can be recovered from the network s steady - state properties . in our model , each node in the network has two related tasks : time synchronization and estimating the next oscillator location . to achieve time synchronization ,<n> each node wants to estimate the time of the next zero - crossing . if it can estimate this time , then it can effectively estimate the next integer value of this time scale . <n> the goal of this work is to show that spatial averaging , which averages out timing errors , can effectively average out all uncertainties in the system as we let node density grow unbounded . such a result would provide rigorous theoretical support for a new trade - off between network density and synchronization performance . over the last two decades , physicists , biologists , computer scientists , mathematicians and physicists<n> have come to view time synchronization as a key primitive for understanding complex processes in nature @xcite  time synchronization is the ability of a set of nodes in a network to synchronize their pulse transmissions so that all nodes in the network have the same synchronization state . in this paper , we show how to achieve time synchronization in an asymptotically dense network by developing a cooperative algorithm that predicts the pulse arrival time at a node and also averages out the resulting random errors . <n> time synchronization has become a major goal in network science and engineering .<n> for example , in the field of time synchronization @xcite , the goal is to synchronize all the nodes of a network so that each node s pulse transmission time can be predicted from the sum of all pulse arrival times at all the other nodes . here , @xmath0 is the number of nodes , and , _ a priori _ , no perfect synchronization is required . however , if the nodes have the ability to predict the arrival time of a pulse at any point in time , they can use this prediction to cooperatively create an aggregate waveform that will give a zero - crossing at the next integer value of this value . for time synchronization to be achieved in a given network , it is then necessary that the nodes are able to generate a pulse transmission synchronization is the problem of having a set of nodes , each with an associated pulse - transmitter , synchronize the arrival times of transmitted pulses in such a way that the predicted arrival time of a pulse at a node is as close as possible to a desired value .<n> we consider a network of nodes that are connected by a pulse - transfer link and wish to synchronize their pulse arrival times , or equivalently , their time synchronization . we show that synchronization can be achieved in a probabilistic way by making use of pulse - state information and pulse - arrival - time estimation . <n> synchronization is a fundamental problem in many areas of science and engineering . in particular ,<n> the synchronization of physical systems , such as optical fibers @xcite or superconducting circuits @xmath0 , is essential for many applications , including high - speed communications , synchronization of complex networks , and synchronization of large numbers of devices such as computers , sensors , etc . here , we will focus on synchronization of optical fibers and superconducting circuits , where the goal is to synchronize the time of optical pulses between two spatially distant nodes . for such a network , it is important that the synchronization is performed accurately and precisely , so that we consider the problem of estimating the state of a single pulse from a sequence of pulse receive times observed at two nodes .<n> we assume that the two receiving nodes are nodes in a multi - terminal quantum communication network , and that the quantum state of the receiving node is known at the time of each observation . in this paper , we present a general framework for the joint estimation of the state and a random variable parameterized by past observations . we show that the mean squared error between the joint estimate and the random variable is bounded by a constant independent of the size of the quantum communication channel . <n> quantum state estimation is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory @xcite , with applications in quantum teleportation @xmath0 , quantum key distribution ( qkd)@xcite and quantum cryptography @x . for the teleportation problem ,<n> the most popular quantum state estimator is the von neumann ( v - nl ) estimator , which is unbiased and performs well , on average , for all values of the input random variable , even though it is known that the state is not available at the receiving nodes , provided that the input is a known quantum state . since the v - in this paper , we propose a synchronization criterion for single - photon data .<n> this criterion can be used to evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of single - shot data , and to estimate the correlations between the data and the environment . as a result ,<n> we show that the snr can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy , even in the presence of noise . <n> pacs numbers : : 03.67.-a , 42.50.dv , 42.65.hw , 89.70.+c in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in the development of multiphoton systems for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . in particular , it has been realized that single photons ( ss ) can be efficiently used as qubits in qip systems , as long as the photons can be detected in a non - destructive way . to realize such a system , one needs to synchronize the photons in order to obtain high - fidelity qubit operations . for a given qubit state , the qubit coherence time ( @xmath0 )<n> is defined as in this paper , we derive the optimal unbiased estimator for the fisher information matrix of a linear gaussian noise model .<n> we show that this estimator is efficient , in the sense that it achieves the cramer rao lower bound . <n> [ [ section ] ] unbiased estimators for fisher information matrices are of fundamental importance in statistical mechanics , and have been extensively studied in the literature . in @xcite<n> , it was shown that for a class of linear noise models , the information matrix is uniformly unbiased ( umvu ) , i.e. it has the same asymptotic distribution as the information , @xmath0 , which is given by the fisher matrix . from this result<n> it was conjectured that this unbiased estimator is optimal , for example , this is true for the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of the information of interest in the linear model , given the fisher - information matrix , if the noise model is linear , that is , its coefficients are independent of all other noise samples . however , to the best of our knowledge this is the first unbiased estimation result for the information in this class of models . for a linear model<n>  the problem of joint prediction of the arrival times of pulses at a set of nodes is considered .<n> it is shown that the cramer rao lower bound on the mean squared error can be extended to a function of parameters . as a result , a new technique for joint prediction<n> is developed and is shown to be optimal . time synchronization is the problem of maintaining a sequence of equispaced zero - crossings occurring at integer values of a dynamical variable . in this paper , we establish a time synchronization technique for a network of nodes with simultaneous transmission and reception .<n> we assume that each node in the network has instantaneous access to a pulse - connection function , which gives us the desired properties in the aggregate waveform . as a result ,<n> we have an asymptotic steady - state time synchronization method that can maintain a series of zero - crossing events . an interesting feature of this synchronization technique is that no node needs to know any information about its location or its surrounding neighbors . in this paper , we propose a new approach to the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> we show that , under certain conditions , a pulse with frequency @xmath0 can be distinguished from a background signal with a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 1 at a distance of order 1 cm from the detector . in our approach , the pulse is first transmitted to a set of nodes and then detected by a group of nodes that have an estimator of the pulse location in the time scale of the signal . with this technique ,<n> the detection limit of the gw is determined by the ratio of the frequency of the transmitted pulse to the snr of the background , rather than the pulse frequency . <n> [ sec : intro ] gravitational wave detection is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of gravitational wave astronomy . due to the difficulty in detecting gw s , there has been an increasing interest in using techniques that can extract information about them from a large number of sources , e.g. , gravitational wave detectors @xcite , interferometers @x , and even gravitational - wave - emitting sources such as pulsars @ we study the problem of time synchronization in a multi - hop network where the signals suffer from both pathloss and propagation delay .<n> we introduce the concept of _ cooperative time synchronization _ , and we show that it is possible to synchronize the time of signals in such a network , even in the presence of pathloss , propagation delay and other sources of errors . <n> time synchronization is one of the most fundamental problems in the theory of complex networks @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the case where signals suffer not only from pathloss but also propagation delay<n> . we will see that time synchronization can be achieved in a number of different ways , depending on the topology of the network and the amount of information that can be exchanged between the different sets of time - varying signals in the network . for a single set of signals ,<n> we show how to synchronize them in a cooperative manner , i.e. we synchronously change the time - variable of the signal at each time point in time . as a result<n> , the time scale of the signals can be adjusted so that they are synchronized at the same time point . the time synchronization technique that we propose is based on the idea in this paper , we present a solution to the problem of pulse propagation through a network of nodes .<n> we assume that each node transmits a pulse at a constant rate , which is the same as the rate at which information is transmitted by all the other nodes in the network . using the propagation delay model ,<n> we show that a pulse transmitted by a single node can be averaged out to average out the time delays at other nodes , and we use this average out propagation delay to characterize the aggregate waveform transmitted at any given node in terms of its delay . <n> [ sec : intro ] communication over a network is usually done by means of the transmission of a single pulse of information . in order to achieve reliable communication , however , it is important to be able to transmit the information with sufficient delay that it can not propagate through the network completely . for example , in the case of cellular networks , information can be conveyed by the use of two - dimensional ( 2d ) waveguides that can be combined to form a network @xcite . as shown in refs . [ eq : cellular - network ] , for @xmath0 cells , a 2d waveguide in this paper , we study the time - synchronization properties of waveforms that are generated by a single node in a cooperative communication network .<n> we introduce a new delay model that is applicable to networks with arbitrary number of interior nodes . using this delay model ,<n> we show that the aggregate waveform generated at any interior node has the following limiting properties : ( 1 ) it is independent from all other pulses ; ( 2 ) the time scale of the waveform is equal to the network time scale ; and ( 3 ) there is no propagation delay . time synchronization is a fundamental concept in many areas of science and engineering .<n> we show that time synchronization with propagation delay can be implemented in a cooperative manner using a set of equispaced zero - crossings . <n> time synchronization , which describes the ability of a system to synchronize itself in time , is one of the most important concepts in physics , engineering , biology , and social sciences @xcite . in this letter<n> , we consider time synchronization in a communication network , where each node is connected to the rest of the network by a time - varying link - parameter @xmath0 , the so - called pulse - connection function . here ,<n> we will focus on time synchronization for discrete - time systems , i.e. systems that have time - dependent parameters , such as the time - variable , pulse - length , or delay , that characterizes the connection between the nodes . we will show that in such a system , steady - state time synchronization can be maintained by generating a limiting aggregate waveform that has the following properties : ( i ) every node has the same pulse connection , ( ii ) each node has its own pulse connection function that is odd around we introduce the concept of propagation delay in networks with time synchronization . in this setting , each time node can use its ability to estimate the next integer value of a parameter in the network s pulse - connection function to synchronize the values of other time nodes .<n> this gives the network the ability to maintain equispaced zero - crossings indefinitely . <n> synchronization is the ability of a physical system to synchronize its state to a state of another physical system s that has the same state . for a discrete - time system ,<n> this means that each node has a sequence of observations that have the form @xmath0 , where the first value is known and the second value is unknown . if each interior node knows the value of the first observation , they are able to synchronize their observations to the value at which the observation is made . on the other hand , if there is a continuous - time network , then each node is able to use its knowledge of the second observation to synchronize both their observations and those of the other nodes to a value that is known to be equal to the first , and vice - versa . here<n> , we consider the generalization of time synchronization to the case where there is propagation delay time synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in many fields of science and engineering .<n> we show that under certain conditions , we can synchronize the nodes of a time - varying network in steady - state . <n> time synchronization has been studied for many years in physics , chemistry , biology , computer science , engineering , social sciences , and finance @xcite . in most cases ,<n> synchronization is considered to be a macroscopic process in which the nodes must synchronize their behavior in order to function properly . however , in many practical applications , such as in robotics , the nodes need to synchronize not only to function correctly , but also to maintain a certain level of synchronization in the face of time - consuming and unpredictable perturbations . here<n> we study the synchronization properties of a network of nodes , where each node is responsible for synchronizing the rest of the network in some sense @xmath0 . for a single - node network<n> , it is known that if all nodes can synchronize , then the network can effectively function as a single physical system . as such , time synchronization of the interior nodes is possible . on the other hand , for a two - dimensional network , synchronization of we study the problem of timing synchronization in a multi - node network with time - varying boundary conditions .<n> we show that there is a tradeoff between the time that synchronization can be delayed and the maximum degree of synchronization that can be achieved . for a delay of @xmath0<n> , we can guarantee that synchronization is achieved for all network nodes , regardless of their location in the network , provided that they have a sufficiently large degree of knowledge about the distribution of the pulses that are transmitted . in the case of a delay that is exponentially small in the distance between the pulses ,<n> we prove that the synchronization is guaranteed to be achieved for any number of network nodes greater than a critical value that depends only on the number of boundary nodes . <n> synchronization is the process by which information is exchanged between any pair of nodes in a distributed system such as a wireless network or a social network so that each pair can be assured that the information exchanged isgglers that do not change the state of the system @xcite . when synchronization is delayed , there is no guarantee that the system will reach its optimal state , and the time required to synchronize the system can grow exponentially with the time delay . as a result , synchronization is in this paper we study time synchronization with propagation delay for single hop and multi - hop networks . in single hop networks<n> we show that maintaining time synchronization for the case of propagation delay requires only the boundary nodes to know their pulse - connection function .<n> we then show that spatial averaging over the inherent errors present in the network can be used to effectively average out the errors introduced by time delay . <n> pacs numbers : 89.75.hc , 89.65.gh , 05.40.-a in recent years there has been a growing interest in the problem of time synchronization in diverse fields of science and technology . of particular interest<n> is the synchronization of complex dynamical systems such as autonomous systems , systems with multiple degrees of freedom , and networks of communication links @xcite . for the time synchronization problem ,<n> the fundamental question is how one can maintain synchronization in the presence of time - delay , i.e. , when both the transmitter and the receiver have time - delayed waveforms . here , we study the synchronization problem in the context of a single hop network , where we assume that the transmitter only has time - to - arrival ( t - ar ) and time - in this paper , we consider the problem of scalability for time synchronization in finite sized networks with high densities .<n> first , in the regime of high densities ( fixed area , @xmath0 ) we estimate the maximum number of hops over which synchronization information must travel in order to maintain a fully connected network with high probability . using this estimate ,<n> we study how the synchronization error in a generic pairwise synchronization mechanism depends on this number of hoppings . <n> second , using the estimate for the minimum required transmission distance for a network to be fully connected , and then using the evolution of zero - crossings in finite networks to understand what types of synchronization are achievable under the situation where zero - crossing locations evolve in time , the scalability issue is revisited under the light of work developed in this work . to conclude , this work addresses the issue of propagation delay in asymptotically dense networks and characterize the behavior of the network . the main purpose of this work is to provide a different set of tools that will be needed to understand the synchronization types that are achievable in a finite sized network in the high density regime and to characterize the behaviors of networks in general in the case where the number of nodes in the network is finite  in this paper , we consider the problem of distributed quantum computation , where nodes communicate with each other in a distributed manner .<n> we assume that each node is equipped with a quantum memory , which can store the state of the nodes at any time . in order to synchronize ,<n> each node transmits a pulse at a specific time , based on an estimate of its own quantum state . as a result , node @xmath0 can estimate the value of the clock at each other , as well as the time of arrival of the pulses transmitted by other nodes . we show that this synchronization can be achieved in the limit of an infinite number of nodes , and we derive an upper bound on the number of rounds of synchronization required . <n> quantum computation is one of the central themes in modern physics , with applications ranging from the simulation of gravitational waves @xcite , to the distribution of quantum states of the electromagnetic field in a radio - frequency domain @x<n> . one important class of quantum computation involves distributed quantum networks , in which the nodes are connected to each other by a distributed quantum network . here<n> , a network consists of a set of nodes ( alice , bob ,  in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the number of qubits that can be qubits in a two - qubit register .<n> we present a general framework where each qubit is estimated at its own node . in this framework ,<n> we show that each node suffers from jitter variance of the form @xmath0 = left [ beginarrayc  alpha_3(tau_2) + lfrachatalpha_x2alpha 2 +1big)$ ] . however , there is an accumulation of error because each node s estimate has a mean that is dependent on nodes mean . as a result , if node @xxmath436 has some small error , then that error will propagate to the estimate of a node , even if the clock frequencies are the same . <n> qubit estimation is one of the most important problems in quantum information theory . for a single qubit , it is important to be able to estimate how many qubits are in the register , and how fast they can be estimated . to solve this problem<n> , in this paper , we describe a new time synchronization technique for dense heterogeneous networks .<n> the fundamental idea behind this technique is that by using spatial averaging , the errors inherent in each node can be averaged out . by using observations that are an average \" of the information from a large number of surrounding nodes , synchronization performance can be improved due to the higher quality observations . <n> synchronization is a fundamental operation in many fields , ranging from physics to biology . in particular ,<n> synchronization plays an important role in the heart of cellular automata @xcite , and plays an essential role in synchronization - enhanced neural networks , e.g. , in the area of molecular motors . for many years<n> , it has been thought of as a monolithic \" operation , meaning that each node in a network needs to be prepared in some state and then be able to send information to the other nodes in the network in order to be synchronized . as a result , there has been a trade - off between network designers and engineers : as the network density increases , network designers have more control over synchronization performance , but as the node density grows , engineers have less control over timing errors . here<n>  in this paper , we propose a class of cooperative time synchronization mechanisms that take advantage of equispaced zero - crossings to improve synchronization performance . we show that in networks that are finite in size , the asymptotic performance of these mechanisms is good predictors of performance in finite - sized networks . with the goal of developing practical cooperative synchronization mechanisms ,<n> two keys areas of interest are cooperative synchronization in networks and algorithm development . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in this work we propose and analyze a new class of synchronization mechanisms based on spatial averaging .<n> these ideas can be seen as a natural extension of the concept of synchronization developed in @xcite . here<n> , nodes in a network have the ability to aggregate waveforms , i.e. pulses , and use them to synchronize information . by controlling the location of these crossings we can modulate information onto this aggregate waveform and use it to communicate with a far receiver . for the purpose of synchronization , it is important to understand the asymptotic properties of the aggregate waveform that are useful for predicting the performance of the synchronization mechanism . in the case<n> that we have @xmath0 nodes , each node can send an impulse at their estimate in this work , we show that the expectation of a pulse connection function is bounded and continuous on a compact domain when the pulse connection is chosen to be a function of the variance of the input .<n> we also show that a sequence of independent random variables will apply to the sequence of pulse connection functions and that the strong law of large numbers will apply . <n> * keywords : * synchronization , pulse connection , random variable , strong law , large numbers . *<n> pacs :* 03.65.yz , 05.45.mt , 89.70.+c , 89.75.da . [ [ section ] ] the study of synchronization has a long and distinguished history . in @xcite<n> , it was shown that the mean value of a physical quantity , @xmath0 , is bounded from above by the mean of a random variable @x<n> s , which is called the expectation , when the value of the random variable is taken to have a nonzero finite value . since then , there has been a resurgence of interest in synchronization and in particular , in understanding the origin of synchronization . from the early days of in this paper , we show that the bipartite graph of a real - world network with arbitrary degree distribution converges to the graph of an euclidean path .<n> we do this by finding the set of pairs of nodes in the network such that for each pair of nodes , there is an @xmath0-nearest - neighbor graph that has the same degree distribution as the original network . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a lower bound on the degree distribution function of real networks . <n> [ theorem]lemma [ theorem : continuity ] in this paper , we show that the limits of integration of a given function in @xmath0 $ ] , over a closed interval , are riemann integrable .<n> we also show that any function that is continuous except at a finite number of points , except for the sums and products of continuous functions , is also continuous . as well ,<n> if a function is continuous , then the absolute value of that function is also continuously . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the problem of bounding the limit of integration @xcite of a bounded function in the complex plane was first posed by strichartz @xcitation . in his proof , he showed that the absolute values of the continuous functions in the plane are also continuous and that the sum and product of any two continuous functions are continuous as well<n> . however , at the same time , the sum of their absolute values is not continuous and the product of their products is not . from this point of view , it is natural to ask , what is the limit ? <n> the answer to this question is well - known in the continuous case , namely , that the limit is _  in this paper , we show that for any given @xmath0 , there exists a unique non - negative real valued function of the form @math1 which is riemann integrable over any closed interval .<n> moreover , the value of this integral is uniformly bounded over all closed intervals . as a result ,<n> we obtain an upper bound on the maximum jump at a discontinuity in this integral . <n> the problem of finding the maximum value of an integral defined over a closed interval has been studied for many years @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been well known that the maximum possible value of any integral defined on the positive real line is bounded from above by a function that depends only on the values of the reals on the real line . for example , for the integral defined by the following equation , @xmath2 $ ] , where math3  is a gaussian function on the set of all reals and  sum_n$ ] is an integral over the set xmath4  of positive integers , i.e. , on the interval geq 0 $  in this paper , we study the time - delay problem for the synchronous phase - shift ( ss ) generator , which is the s generator used in the well - known time - domain delay - multiplexing ( tdmm ) scheme .<n> we show that the time delay associated with this generator scales as @xmath0 , where the constants are related to the bandwidth of the channel and the pulse duration . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an upper bound on the bandwidth that can be used for sdmm based on pulse arrival times . <n> * keywords : * time - delayed s , pulse arrival time , multiplexing , bandwidth , delay , time - synchronization , adaptive filtering . *<n> ams subject classification ( 2010 ) : 42c15 , 42c05 , 94a12 , 93a20 . [ [ section ] ] in the time domain , a time - dependent waveform is a waveform that describes the time evolution of a physical process such as a sequence of chemical reactions , or a physical system such as an atom , molecule , etc . in time domain signal processing , we present an exact solution of the non - linear @xmath0-matrix equation for a spin-@xmath1 particle in an external magnetic field .<n> the solution is obtained in the framework of the coupled channel formalism , and it is valid for arbitrary values of the external field , i.e. , for arbitrary strengths of the coupling to the spin - orbit interaction . as an application<n> , we calculate the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments of the spin-1 particle . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 11.10.lm , 12.20.ds , 14.20.dh in quantum field theory ( qft ) one of the most fundamental problems is the determination of the ground state of a quantum system in presence of a background magnetic field @xcite . in this context ,<n> the problem is important not only from the fundamental point of view , but also for practical applications , such as in the field of spintronics , quantum information processing , or quantum simulation of quantum many - body systems . to solve this problem , one usually resorts to the so - called perturbative methods , which are based on the solution of we consider the problem of estimating the size of a network of point - to - point sensors that are transmitting data over a public channel .<n> we assume that the sensors are equipped with a vlti detector , and that the input data is linearly correlated . in this paper<n> , we will use the wang - landau algorithm to estimate the size @xmath0 of the sensor network . <n> we will first consider the case of a single sensor that is transmitting data to a remote location . for each input data point<n> we would like to estimate its size , which we will call the _ average sensor _ , that is , the one that has the largest average signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) . under the assumption that the average sensor is connected to the world wide web ( www ) and is in a local neighborhood of each other ,<n> we show that for any fixed value of the distance between the two sensor nodes , there is a probability distribution for the average of the sensors on the www that is a gaussian distribution with a large tail . we will show that this distribution is _ asymptotically _ normal to the distribution of the average we discuss the use of self - organized criticality ( soc ) for the construction of large - scale sensor networks .<n> the soc paradigm is based on the idea that a network can be driven from a state of local self - organization by the interaction with its local environment . in soc networks ,<n> the interaction between a sensor and its environment is non - linear and non - deterministic . as a result , the network is not self - organizing , but rather it is driven from the state of the environment to its final state . <n> _ keywords _ : sensor networks - networks - criticality",

core collision among particles a viscous fluid @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the viscosity of the fluid , @xmath15 is the mass of the particles and @xmath16 with the gravitational acceleration @xmath17 , and the densities of the particle @xmath18 and the fluid @xmath19 .    in eq ( [ eq : eofm -

of - sight dispersion data are as consistent with the mond predictions as they are with the newtonian , no dm ones .    the reason is that within the radii measured the mass discrepancy predicted by mond is not larger than the measurement errors and/or the uncertainties due to the unknown orbit population .    to better manage these latter uncertainties , romanowsky et al .    have applied to the best studied galaxy , ngc 3379 , an orbit - library method described in detail in their paper ( this entails , of course , variable anisotropies in the velocity distribution ) .    the outcome of this analysis is a better constrained range of allowed potential fields for this galaxy .    this is described as a permitted range of rotation curves given in their fig  a2 , and reproduced here in our fig .  2 as the hatched area . see that the mond predictions of the kinematics of the galaxies under study , as deduced from the observed light distribution assuming a constant @xmath25 value , agree well with the observations , assuming very reasonable orbit populations . ccording to the mond predictions , the strength and importance of these findings is , however , not in the exact quality of the agreement . ccording to the mond predictions , we have seen more impressive performances of mond in predicting rotation curves of disc galaxies ( e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) , where the data are more accurate , and where the uncertainty in orbit population is hardly present . ccording to the mond predictions , the importance here is that this new comparison confirms the prediction of mond regarding the high acceleration end of the galaxy distribution @xcite , which has not been probed before . ccording to the mond predictions , ngc 3379 is the best studied of the three and with the measurements going the farthest in unit of @xmath13 . ccording to the mond predictions , it has @xmath29 , and seems to be the present record holder among galaxies with measured extended rotation curves . ccording accordingly , in conformity with the mond predictions , it is also , and a mass discrepancy does develop in full strength at the outskirts , we do nt view these hsb galaxies as devoid of a mass discrepancy , only as developing it at larger radii . � this is also what mond predicts for the galaxies in the present study ( as shown by the @xmath25 runs in fig . � there are ellipticals with @xmath37 , as studied here , for which a mass discrepancy has been claimed already at smaller radii . � if these are substantiated , and correctly interpreted , they would certainly argue against mond . � there are , for example , ellipticals such as m87 ( e.g. ct et al . 2001 ) and m49 ( e.g. , ct et al . 2003 ) that have been dynamically studied by both globular cluster ( gcs ) dynamics and x -

dimensional angular momentum related to the @xmath16th jacobi coordinate , namely @xmath17 . � physical states are then characterized by a spin @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . � the parity @xmath21 is defined as the operation @xmath21 is defined as the operation @xmath22 @xcite : it is crucial to note that @xmath23 . � therefore , the state @xmath24 has the parity @xmath25 , -@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6-@xmath6 The polynomial and the dots , denoting the terms with lower degrees , will be dropped . @xmath6 . � the large-@xmath1 limit of our model reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are dimensionless conjugate variables . � the free parameter is @xmath67 , that we set equal to @xmath68 . � the agreement between our model and the lattice data of @xcite can be appraised in table [ tab ] : it is very satisfactory with respect to the simplicity of our approach . as mentioned before , the numerical results have been obtained thanks the dos method @xcite . � they have been checked by the use of lagrange - mesh method @xcite which can be easily extended to @xmath0-@xmath6 systems while preserving its high accuracy . � a fit of the mass spectrum in the large-@xmath1 limit shows that the masses of the @xmath69 states , that have @xmath70 quantum numbers , are located on the regge trajectory @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 . � this compares favorably with the lattice result @xmath74 , @xmath75 , found in @xcite . � such a regge trajectory may be presented and applied to explicitly build all states with a well - defined permutation symmetry up to the @xmath80 band in our notation . � one first defines the jacobi coordinates @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and then works with the coordinates @xmath83 . � this is convenient because the action of the parity operator and of the permutation operators on these four coordinates is straightforwardly computed @xcite .    in a harmonic oscillator basis , � the spatial wave function of any three gluon state has the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a polynomial in @xmath86 . � totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric polynomials can then be built and , by linear combination , one can obtain polynomials that are also eigenstates of @xmath87 and of the parity ( @xmath88 ) . for the parity � the spatial wave function of any three gluon state has the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a polynomial in @xmath86 . � the terms with the highest degree of the functions @xmath85 leading to given glueball states are listed in table has a @xmath95-shape as far as su(@xmath1 ) is chosen @xcite : the gluons are linked by fundamental strings , and the hamiltonian reads @xmath96 , whose large-@xmath1 limit is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are dimensionless conjugate variables .    the mass spectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ h3b ] ) is given in table  [ tab2 ] .    the masses of three - gluon glueballs have been computed with the dos method .    the mass of the @xmath89 states can also be straightforwardly obtained by performing variational computations with gaussian trial wave functions of the type @xmath100 . applying techniques similar to those of @xcite in the case of two spatial dimensions , one obtains for example the upper bound @xmath101 , with a size @xmath102 .    this value is actually close to our semiclassical estimates , as are the masses found for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 glueballs .     this is another check of the validity of the dos approximation scheme . should have a spatial symmetry of the form @xmath110 .    in the flux tube picture , there are thus two totally antisymmetric two - gluon clusters : this can be reached by a @xmath111 two - gluon wave function of the form @xmath112 . in the flux tube picture , where two fundamental strings originate from each constituent gluon , the mass of such a cluster is equal to @xmath113 in units of @xmath114 .    in order to satisfy at best the quantum state of the clusters being known , we can couple them in order to obtain a @xmath92 state . in order to satisfy at best the mixed symmetry of the four - gluon state ,    we ask for the two clusters to be identical and for the two - cluster state to be the lightest @xmath27 state . the glueball mass computed this way     is 10.11 in units of @xmath114 : although being a seemingly rough estimate , it is in good agreement with the lattice result 9.47(116 ) @xcite .    from this discussion , the behavior of thelightest glueballs with respect to a change of gauge xmath125 a gauge - group - independent constant that we compute to be equal to @xmath126 for the lightest @xmath47 glueball . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ equivalently , we expect the glueball masses normalized to @xmath127 to be gauge - group independent . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the recent lattice work @xcite provides us a way to check this last equation since the behavior of the scalar glueball in @xmath0-@xmath6 versus @xmath1 has been computed for both su(@xmath1 ) and so(@xmath2 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this can be compared to the lattice data ( points ) of @xcite for su(@xmath1 ) and so(@xmath2 ) , one can plot the evolution of the scalar glueball mass versus @xmath1 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this can be compared to the lattice data ( points ) of @xcite for su(@xmath1 ) and so(@xmath2 ) , one can plot the evolution of the scalar glueball mass versus @xmath1 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is done in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig ] , where it can be seen that the lattice behavior is well reproduced by our , in su(2 ) computations , the link between the adjoint string breaking length scale and the lightest glueball mass is @xmath133 .  in su(2 ) computations , however , the adjoint string breaking energy is expected to be twice the lightest gluelump mass : @xmath134 . using ( [ sadj ] ) , the result of @xcite can be rewritten as @xmath135 we find 14.6 for the l.h.s .  of this relation , which is in good agreement with the lattice results .    we have analyzed the structure of the glueball spectrum in @xmath0-@xmath6 by resorting to a constituent picture : each glueball is described as a bound state of a given number of transverse , massive , constituent gluons .    pauli s principle leads to selection rules : the allowed @xmath136 states match the corresponding lattice results @xcite .  pauli s principle leads to a simple dynamical model  relativistic kinematics plus linear confinement  leads to a satisfactory , although not fully quantitative , agreement with the glueball and glue lump masses found in @xcite . a summary plot . � s.  capstick and n.  isgur , phys . � d * 34 * , 2809 ( 1986 ) . � r.  g.  edwards , j.  j.  dudek , d.  g.  richards , and s.  j.  wallace , phys . � d * 84 * , 074508 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1104.5152 ] � s.  j.  j.  dudek , r.  g.  edwards , b.  joo , m.  j.  peardon , d.  g.  richards , and c.  e.  thomas , phys . � d * 83 * , 111502 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1102.4299 ] . � j. beringer _ � ( particle data group ) , phys . � d * 86 * , 010001 ( 2012 ) . � v.  mathieu , n.  kochelev , v.  mathieu , n.  kochelev , and v.  vento , int . � j.  mod . .  cornwall , phys .  rev . � d * 26 * , 1453 ( 1982 ) . ursa , r.  lau , and m.  teper , arxiv:1208.4547 . \u001c a.  cucchieri , t.  mendes , and a.  r.  taurines , phys .  rev .  warr d * 67 * , 091502 ( 2003 ) [ hep -

organization , rapid deployment , flexibility , and inherent intelligent - processing capability . in this     regard , iwsn plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self - healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real - time events with appropriate actions [ 2 ] .     recently , more attentions have been paid to the research and development of high frequency surface - wave radar ( hfswr ) due to its potentiality in military and civil application . as the working frequency is relatively low ( @xmath0mhz ) ,     the wavelength is extremely long . in order to maintain the performance of radar system , such as signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and angular resolution , the size of receiving antenna array is always very large .     there are many drawbacks in military and civil application due to the high frequency surface - wave radar ( hfswr ) due to its potentiality in military and civil , rainstorm and smog , etc .      moreover , the available space of the warship is limited , it is very difficult to erect a large antenna array .      therefore , research on the compact receiving array of hfswr is becoming urgently .      the selection of array configuration and the pattern synthesis method of array are two important parts for the array miniaturization design .      it is a target for array miniaturization design that the directivity of the system design requirement has to be satisfied when the array size is small or limited .      thus it is required that the array has super directivity .      compared with the uniform excitation of each array element , the super directivity array has higher directive by varying the excitation mode of each array element . compared with the common array , the super directivity array has higher directive in the same array aperture .      it is a target for array miniaturization design that the directive array antenna plays an important role in designing the compact array .    at present , the optimal linear constraints [ 3 , 4 ] , adaptive array [ 5 , 6 ] and genetic algorithm [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] or other intelligent optimization algorithm [ 10 , 11 ] are three representative numerical pattern synthesis , the distributed parameter estimation is achieved in battlefield surveillance system .  embodiments detection and tracking of moving objects has been identified as a well - suited application , which would benefit from the use of mwsn [ 16 - 19 ] . in this paper ,  embodiments super directive circular arrays are designed and compared by using mwsn .  embodiments the highest directivity with certain constrains is achieved , and with the super directive circular array as sub arrays , the size of the received antenna array is reduced .  embodiments computer simulation verifies the correctness and affectivity of the proposed method .  embodiments for hfswr , the elements , which can monitor enemy aircrafts and missiles , are usually deployed near the coastline . thus mobile nodes can be thrown down by aircraft in the deployment regions , which are far away from the military base . in order to monitor enemy air targets ,  embodiments deployment regions of mwsns are vitally important to protect the military base . to the best of our knowledge  embodiments for hfswr , the mountainside near the coastline facing the direction of enemy attack is an excellent place to deploy mobile nodes , as shown in fig .  embodiments 1 . when enemy aircrafts and missiles are coming  embodiments , sensor nodes can detect the electromagnetic wave into a quadratic programming problem .    the solution of the problem below is the corresponding weight vector . @xmath14=0 \\\\   & \\operatorname{re}[{{v}_{\\phi } } ^{h}({{\\theta } _ { 0}},{{\\phi } _ { 0}})w]=0 \\end{array } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the numerator of ( 4 ) is constrained to be 1 ensures that the gain in the look direction is constant .    the followings are mainlobe constrains which maintain the presence of a peak in this direction .    the subscripts @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) denote partial differentiation with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .    the maximum directivity @xmath17 can be achieved by solving ( 7 ) .    the followings are mainlobe constrains which maintain the presence of a peak in this direction .   the followings are mainlobe constrains which maintain the presence of a peak in this direction .   the subscripts @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) denote set @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the optimal weight vector under efficiency constrain    \\(4 ) find the _ external noise condition .    if the total pattern is ideal , the radiation direction can be changed flexibly just by rotating the weight vector of the circular array .    if the array has a high directivity and a small size , which can meet the actual needs very well .     a super - directivity synthesis method for designing super - directivity array based on mwsn is presented . by optimizing array directivity   the array is subject to rein and sidelobe constrains , the maximum possible directivity can be achieved .    by using the super directive circular array , the optimized array of mwsn may have a smaller size with the same directivity compared with conventional array . by using the super directive circular array as sub - arrays , the receive   the array of mwsn can be miniaturized .    the benefits of the method have been demonstrated by the simulation results . by calculating the _ a _ and _ b _ in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for other conditions , this method    can also be applied to other array structures .    in the future , we will focus on direction -

[ data ] we have studied the correlation of 195 companies , which were traded during the available 54 days more than 15000 times . in accordance with the arguments presented in the previous section we have used @x the maximal value of the correlations turn out to be quite small , in average less than 0.1 , ( _ e.g. _ see fig . [ esv - xon ] ) , although the generally quoted equal time cross correlations have much larger values .      the root of this effect lies in the choice of the time difference , @xmath13 . increasing @xmath13 increases the values of the equal time correlations @xcite .    in some cases    the position of the maximum correlation was found at values much larger than few minutes which would be inconsistent with the efficient market behavior .    a closer inspection revealed that in such cases the peak in the correlation function is caused by two major return values in the considered time series .    in some cases    the return value  dominates the contribution of their product to the correlation  at appropriate value of the time shift  dominates the maximum of the correlation function .     in some cases    these are not the effects we are looking for , therefore we did not take them into account . in order to check whether the peak in the correlation is due to some single large return value or due to persistent influence of one of is consistent with the effective market hypothesis .    in this paper we found that a time shift larger than the characteristic time of the decay of the return auto - correlations would contradict with the efficient market picture and could be used to arbitrage .    in this paper we found that in general the more frequently traded companies are influencing ( `` pulling '' ) the less frequently traded ones .    in this paper we found that this is not surprising since obviously the more frequently traded companies are more important .    in this paper we found that in general the more frequently traded companies are influenced by many `` large '' companies and it is therefore more likely that they influence a smaller company than the other way around .    in this paper we found that although this is the generic situation , there are a few exceptions when a less often traded company `` pulls '' the other one .    in this study we found that in general one `` small '' company is influenced by many `` large '' companies and one `` large '' company pulls many `` small '' ones . as can be seen in fig .    in this paper we found that in the case of `` pulling '' [ arrow ] this behaviour can be represented as a graph of directed links , where there the time window of the returns and by averaging over their starting points the detection of the correlation effect gets easier .    with the real data we saw that it is possible to find pairs of stocks where the pulling effect exists , though it turned out to be small .    in addition , the characteristic time shift - given by the position of maximum correlation - was found to be of the order of a few minutes .     these findings are compatible with the efficient market picture .    as for the pulling effect we found that generically the more traded , and thus more important companies pull the relatively smaller companies .    this result is consistent with that of @xcite . in this light    we think that it is not surprising that in the study of the time - dependent cross correlation functions of pairs of companies in the dow jones industrial average index no pulling effect was found .     this underlines the fact that the dow jones companies are indeed among the most important stocks of the new york stock exchange .    finally we would like to propose that    although the observed pulling effect was small , our careful analysis could show that it is significant for a considerable set of pairs of companies . vandewalle , ph . � boveroux , f. brisbois , eur . � j. b , * 15 * , 547 , ( 2000 ) . c. schulze , int . � c , 13 , 207 ( 2002 ) . � a. lo , a.c mackinlay , rev . � financial studies , * 3 * , 175 ( 1990 ) . � j. campbell , a. lo , a.c . � j. campbell , a. lo , a.c . � mackinlay , _ the econometrics of financial markets _ , princeton university press ( 1997 ) . � r. mantegna and h.e . � stanley , _ econophysics _ , cambridge up , ( 2000 ) . � y. liu , p. gopikrishnan , p. cizeau , m. meyer , c. peng , h. eugene stanley , phys . � e , * 60 * , 1390 , ( 1999 ) . � e. f. fama , j. finance , * 25 * , 383 ( 1970 cn first chicago nbd corp . � banking + flc falcon drilling co. inc . � marine -

Unfortunately, much work went into identifying signals from interferometer channels or environmental monitors that were consistently associated with inspiral triggers . starting with the inspiral triggers from the s3 playground all of the relevant channels were examined by eye , using numerous different filters . when candidate veto channels were identified veto triggers were generated using glitch finding algorithms . in mind it was found that an effective veto could be created with the channel h2:lsc - refl_q . � the data was processed by glitchmon , using a 100 hz high - pass , and a threshold of @xmath4 . � a veto window was created from 1s before the trigger to 10s after it . with these settings 27% of all s3 h2 inspiral triggers in the playground data � were vetoed , with a deadtime of 0.5% and a veto use percentage of 71% . � the veto efficiency was 42% for s3 h2 inspiral triggers with snr @xmath5 . � the s3 h2 veto triggers from channel h2:lsc - prc_ctrl were created using the kw program  @xcite . � the data were first high - pass filtered at 70  hz and then whitened . � the resulting kw triggers had a threshold _ significance _ � @xcite of 1600 ; the significance is a function of the probability of randomly detecting an event with greater signal energy in perfect white noise . � the s3 h2 veto triggers from channel h2:lsc - prc_ctrl h2:lsc - prc_ctrl are basically equivalent .    with h2 inspiral events they also tend to veto the same events , so using both together as a veto does not increase the efficiency .    with the lsc s3 burst event search for h2 will use h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as a veto  @xcite . in an attempt to be consistent with the use of vetoes we are considering the choice of h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as the s3 h2 inspiral veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    while h1:lsc - asq_q is linearly related to the gravitational wave strain , h1:lsc - as_i contains information on optical imbalances and mirror misalignments .     our investigations of the loudest inspiral triggers in the s3 h1 playground revealed significant coincident disturbances in the two channels resulting from the radio _i kw triggers to have as_q kw trigger counterparts ; we required a minimum energy threshold in the as_i kw triggers , and we required a safe ratio of energies in as_i and as_q .     the kw triggers that satisfied these conditions were considered veto candidates . in fig .   [ fig7 ] we plot the kw energy for as_i and as_q for 60 hardware injections of binary inspiral signals .   [ fig7 ] we looked for coincidences between our veto candidates and inspiral triggers and found that a large percentage were used successfully to veto inspiral triggers .

Unfortunately , the predictor - corrector@xcite , for example , employs lagrange type interpolation formulae ( to fit @xmath20 at a set of times ) , which are explicitly integrated over a time interval , to construct both the predictor and the corrector .     Unfortunately , it is far from clear how an analogous scheme would work for the @xmath35 variables @xmath36 .               and thus , runge - kutta methods seem to be the easiest to develop for sdes .    once an error has been judged too large to be acceptable     , ode codes simply try a smaller step and all information about the original step is lost . then be given by @xmath44 in order to maintain the original wiener process .     we thus , runge - kutta methods can be developed for sdes with strong solutions from runge - kutta methods for odes , and a binary tree variable stepsize strategy can be implemented with sampling on the subintervals via lamba s method@xcite . to show that the combined approach yields an accurate numerical method we solve a variety of stochastic wave equations from the recent physics literature . with the adaptive stepsize strategy     we have chosen there is a good correlation between the speed of an algorithm and its order .     we thus chose to employ the highest order runge - kutta pair available , which as far as we are aware is the 9(8 ) pair of tsitouras@xcite .     we have sucessfully used other lower order methods such as those of @xcite and @xcite , but for consistency all results reported in this paper were calculated using the method described in @xcite .    we thus chose to employ the highest order runge - kutta method implemented with variable stepsizes as described above . 2.\\label{me1}\\ ] ]    to implement our approach we need to find the derivatives of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath51 .    we immediately see that @xmath60 and using ( [ derivs ] ) we also determine that @xmath61 from these results we can now construct @xmath20 using eq .  ( [ rhs ] ) .   [ [ rhs ] ]    the runge - kutta scheme can thus be implemented as discussed above .    the dynamics was solved in a basis consisting of the lowest 11 eigenstates @xmath62 of @xmath49 with @xmath63 .     we also found the lowest 11 eigenstates @xmath63 of @xmath63 for @xmath63 our equations consist of a total of 22 real nonlinear coupled stochastic equations .    we also found the lowest 11 eigenstates @xmath63 of @xmath63 for @xmath63 our equations consist of a total of 22 real nonlinear coupled stochastic equations .    a relative tolerance of @xmath65 was requested . in fig . ho(t)a^{\\dag}-.01a^{\\dag}-.01a^{\\dag}a\\rho(t)-.01\\rho(t)a^{\\dag}a.\\label{me2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the derivatives of @xmath71 with respect to @xmath59 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by @xmath74 the same basis set and tolerance as in example 1 were employed .    the second example consists of stochastic wave equations for a stochastic decomposition of the stochastic decomposition of the schrdinger equation for helium@xcite .    the first example consists of stochastic wave equations for a stochastic decomposition of the schrdinger equation for helium@xcite .   the second example consists of stochastic wave equations for a stochastic decomposition of the schrdinger equation for helium@xcite .    the stochastic decomposition of the schrdinger equation for helium@xcite ( [ me2 ] ) ( solid curve ) .    the stochastic decomposition of the schrdinger math92 dt \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\sum_{s=1}^p\\sqrt{-i\\omega_s } \\left ( o_s - \\langle o_s \\rangle_1 \\right ) \\psi_{1}({\\bf r},t ) dw_t^s \\\\ & -&\\sum_{s=1}^p|\\omega_s \\langle o_s^{\\dag}o_s \\rangle_1 - |\\langle o_s \\rangle_1 \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2}({\\bf r},t)dt\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\sum_{s=1}^p|\\omega_s|\\frac{\\langle \\psi_{1}|\\psi_{1}\\rangle [ \\langle o_s^{\\dag}o_s\\rangle_1 - |\\langle o_s \\rangle_1 - |\\langle o_s \\rangle_1|^{2}]}{2 { \\rm re } \\left\\ { \\langle \\psi ]}{2 { \\rm re } \\left\\ { \\langle \\psi_{1 } |\\psi_{2}\\rangle \\right\\}}\\psi_1({\\bf r},t)dt.\\nonumber \\label{oeqns2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used a notation @xmath93 in the above equations . here \u001c the @xmath94 and operators @xmath95 arise through the one - body expansion of the coulomb interaction @xmath96 which we performed numerically in a basis of he@xmath88 eigenstates@xcite . in the calculation \u001c reported here @xmath97 which means that there are eight real wiener processes . since the initial states are of s type we included only the basis functions of s type with a principle he@xmath88 quantum number of 4 or less@xcite . \u001c this means that the total number of equations was 32 . \u001c clearly this is by far the most computationally difficult of the three examples . in the calculation \u001c the derivatives of @xmath98 are given by @xmath97 which means that there are eight real wiener processes . since the initial states are of s math102 becomes small . � the terms inversely proportional to this factor vary rapidly and the speed of integration slows down greatly . � this occurs every few atomic units . � fortunately , this can be easily avoided by adding a small piece of @xmath103 to @xmath104 , renormalizing the wavefunctions , and carrying the new norm as a weight factor in the stochastic average . � the antisymmetric nature of the full wavefunction guarantees that this manipulation makes no change in the solution .     in figs . � ( [ repsi ] ) and ( [ impsi ] ) we plot the real and imaginary parts of @xmath105 for 200000 trajectories ( dashed curve ) and for the exact solution ( solid curve ) of the shrdinger equation ( [ se1 ] ) . � is satisfactory with some deterioration of accuracy as time proceeds .    finally , we computed the energy spectrum via @xmath106 which we plot in fig . � ( [ repsi ] ) and ( [ impsi ] ) . again satisfactory agreement is obtained . � the fact that complete convergence is not achieved even with 200000 realisations may be due to the relatively large number of . gisin and i. c. percival , j. phys . � a 25 , 5677 ( 1992 ) . � p. gaspard and m. nagaoka , j. chem . � 111 , 5676 ( 1999 ) . � i. carusotto and y. castin , laser physics 13 , 509 ( 2003 ) ;

We corrected the observed background rate far from the cluster , and added it ( normalized by solid angle ) to the nominal background spectra .    the high - energy residuals in the overall cluster fit indicated that the normalization of the corrected background required an additional 10% increase ( perhaps indicating some spatial nonuniformity of the excess ) , which we applied to the spectra from all cluster regions .    to make a @xmath17 kev image for the gas density analysis     , we compared the observed background rate far from the cluster to the nominal model background ( without the above additional component ) and derived a correction factor of 1.35 for this wide band , which was applied to the model background image .    this is of course consistent with the above spectral correction .     a 10% background uncertainty was included in deriving the confidence intervals for all quantities .     this approximate background modeling is adequate for our present qualitative study .    to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties ,    the spectra were extracted in the @xmath18 kev energy band , excluding the @xmath19 kev interval around the mirror ir edge .    the acis image of the abundance of @xmath23 solar , fixing the absorption at @xmath24  as derived by lhba from radio and  pspc data .    this temperature agrees with their  +  fit of @xmath25 kev and is consistent with the @xmath26 kev  fit by t98 . _a _ shows an x - ray brightness profile in a 120  sector centered on the bullet s center of curvature and directed along its apparent motion .    there are two brightness edges whose shapes indicate spherical gas density discontinuities in projection .    we fit this profile by the projection of a gas density model consisting of two power laws @xmath35 centered on the bullet representing the bullet gas and the shock region , respectively .    these are immersed in a @xmath36-model centered on the main cluster ( region _ j _ ) representing the outer , undisturbed gas .    we fit this profile by assuming that all components are spherically symmetric around their respective centers ; it is an adequate assumption in the sector of interest .     the free parameters are the three slopes , two jump amplitudes and two jump radii . a reasonable range of core radii and center positions for the @xmath36-model was explored ( obviously , these can not be restricted by the fit ) and found to have a small effect on our main interesting parameter , the density jump at the shock .    we fit this profile by assuming that the observed temperature difference has a negligible effect on the derived density . at the shock front .    the figure 4_b _ also shows an approximate pressure profile ( the density model times the temperatures from fig.2 ) .    the approximate pressure continuity at the first jump indicates that the bullet boundary is a `` cold front '' , or contact discontinuity , similar to those recently discovered in other clusters .     in principle , as expected , there is a large pressure increase at the shock front .     in principle , a density jump of @xmath43 at the shock corresponds to a mach number @xmath44 ( @xmath45 at 90% ) for a @xmath46 gas and a one - dimensional shock ( strictly speaking , the latter approximation applies only along the direction of the motion , but we can use it as a qualitative estimate for our wide sector ) . the observed temperature jump from @xmath47 kev to @xmath48 kev     in principle , @xmath48 kev    in principle , @xmath48 kev    in principle , @xmath48 kev    in principle , @xmath48 kev    in principle , @xmath48 kev    in principle bullet .

this signal is consistent with what is observed due to passing gravel trucks .  embodiments this dq flag will exclude about 1.5% of the s3 h1 data , and its use percentage is 53% .  embodiments it has been observed that there is an increase in _ glitches _ in the as_q channels of the interferometers for some hours after people have entered the enclosures housing the dark output ports of the interferometers ; this signal is consistent with what is observed from h2 displayed in fig . � the asymmetric distribution of inspiral triggers about the glitch in h2:lsc - as_q led us to design veto windows that started just before the glitch , and then extended for a few seconds afterward . � the asymmetric distribution of inspiral triggers about the glitch in h2:lsc - as_q led us to design veto windows that started just before the glitch , and then extended for a few seconds afterward . � two good candidate veto channels were found for use with h2 s3 inspiral triggers . � h2:lsc - prc_ctrl is a control signal ( @xmath3  force applied ) in the feedback loop that keeps the recycling cavity resonant . � h2:lsc - refl_q is an error signal produced by the light coming from the bright port of the interferometer and traveling back toward the laser , and is generated from the motion of the front mirrors of the fabry - perot cavity arms or the power recycling mirror . because each of these channels respond to excitation in the vicinity of the power recyling optics , both of these channels veto similar glitches in h2:lsc - as_q . as an h2:lsc - prc_ctrl are basically equivalent .    they also tend to veto the same events , so using both together as a veto does not increase the efficiency .    in the lsc s3 burst event search for h2 will use h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as a veto  @xcite . in an attempt to be consistent with the use of vetoes we are considering the choice of h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as the s3 h2 inspiral veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    while h1:lsc - asq_q is linearly related to the gravitational wave strain , h1:lsc - as_i contains information on optical imbalances and mirror misalignments .    our investigations of the loudest inspiral triggers in the s3 h1 playground revealed significant coincident disturbances in the two channels resulting from the radio - frequency demodulation of the ratio of 2 , so a safe veto should have a threshold that is smaller .     has the smallest ratio ( @xmath7 ) between as_q and as_i , width=480 ]    though we looked carefully , no effective and safe veto was found for s3 inspiral events at l1 .    though we looked carefully , no effective and safe veto was found for s3 inspiral events at l1 .     s3 inspiral events at l1:lsc - as_i was studied closely , as numerous glitches in the data were observed in coincidence with inspiral triggers .     however , the veto could not be demonstrated to be completely safe ;

carlo - like scheme@xcite has been used . in each supercell with different lattice vectors , atom positions are randomly exchanged between the atoms and correlation functions of a supercell are calculated after every alternation .   in each supercell with different lattice vectors , atom positions are randomly exchanged between the atoms and correlation functions of a supercell are calculated after every alternation .  if the correlation functions of a new state are getting closer to those of random solutions , then the new configuration is accepted .  if the correlation functions of a new state are getting closer to those of random solutions , then the new configuration is accepted .  if the correlation functions of a new state are getting closer to those of random solutions [12 ] & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -0.01443 & 0.0842 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 25 & -0.00781 & 0.074219 & 0.0625 & 0.0625 & 0.074219 & 0.0625 & 0.0625 & 0.05957 + @xmath73[24 ] & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.006766 & 0.02255 & 0 & -0.002255 & 0.003383 + @xmath73[12 ] & 0 & -0.0625 & -0.10156 & 0.011719 & 0.02604 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.011719 & 0.02604 & 0 & -0.002604 & -0.006836 + @xmath74[6 ] & 0.0625 & -0.125 & 0.015625 & 0.085938 & 0.15625 & 0.0625 & 0.0625 & 0.361328 + @xmath74[12 ] & 0 & 0 & 0 & -0.040595 theory ( dft ) electronic structure calculations . � the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite was chosen and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite was used to take into account exchange and correlation contributions to the hamiltonian of the ion - electron system . an energy cutoff of 364 @xmath77 was used to calculate the electronic structures of all the sqss . 5,000 _ � k_-points per reciprocal atom based on the monkhorst - pack scheme for the brillouin - zone sampling was used . in all first - principles calculations of binary and ternary sqss in the present work � , structures are relaxed in two ways : full relaxation and volume relaxation to preserve the fcc symmetry . � it should be emphasized here that the preserved symmetry is that of sqs when all the atoms are substituted into a single element , which is the underlying fcc symmetry . for the full relaxation of sqs , � structures are completely relaxed with respect to all degrees of freedom i.e. cell shape , volume , and ionic positions , while the symmetry - preserving relaxation only allows to change the cell volume for cubic structures , such as fcc and bcc . in calculating hcp sqss , however three different compositions , namely @xmath3=0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 in @xmath4 alloys . calculated mixing enthalpies from binary fcc sqss are combined with experimental data from the literature@xcite to evaluate interaction parameters in eqn . escription [ eqn : xs2_interaction ] for each binary . for the sake of simplicity , escription [ eqn : xs2_interaction ] for each binary . escription [ eqn : xs2_interaction ] for each binary . for the sake of simplicity , escription parameters for bcc have been modeled as identical to those of fcc . escription parameters for binary bcc sqss also have been calculated and included in the parameter evaluation process . escription [ fig : casryb_bin ] shows that the formation energies of binary bcc and fcc sqss very close to each other in all cases . escription the congruent melting of bcc is observed in both the ca - sr and yb - ca systems , thus the sr - yb system has been modeled to have it as well on the assumption that sr - yb would behave similarly . escription calculated mixing enthalp - yb system with first -

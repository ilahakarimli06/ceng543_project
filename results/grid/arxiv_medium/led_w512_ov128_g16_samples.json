gaussian property in velocity distribution of particles . � this property is consistent with the behavior on granular materials or the system of inelastic particles . � this property is consistent with the behavior of fluidized beds . � qualitative behavior of fluidized beds such as @xmath72 and @xmath59 can be understood by means of the hole theory which has been used for simple liquids . � we would like to thank s. sasa , y -

recall that the distance affects the mond predictions differently from those of newtonian dynamics . ) � there is , of course , nothing preferable about an isotropic velocity distribution ; so , to gain some idea of the uncertainty due the unknown orbit population , we also show mond models with a variable anisotropy ratio ( becoming more radial outwards ) . � the anisotropy parameter in these models is given by @xmath23 where the anisotropy radius @xmath24 in all cases . � there is , of course , nothing preferable about an isot and ngc 4494 , _ considering only models with a constant anisotropy ratio _ , are milder than those given in fig .    the differences are , however , well within the uncertainties due to measurement errors , assumed distances , and modelling .    the reason is that , by and large , the binned , line - of - sight dispersion data are as consistent with the mond predictions as they are with the newtonian , no dm ones .    the reason is that within the radii measured the mass discrepancy predicted by mond is not larger than the measurement errors and/or the uncertainties due to the unknown orbit population .    to better manage these latter uncertainties , romanowsky et al .    have applied to the best studied galaxy , ngc 3379 , an orbit - library method described in detail in their paper ( this entails , of course , variable anisotropies in the velocity distribution ) .    the outcome of this analysis is a better constrained range of allowed potential fields for this galaxy .    this is described as a permitted range of rotation curves given in their fig  a2 , and reproduced here in our fig .  2 as the hatched area .

breaking work . � the theory has been restricted to the case of a uniform system , but has been extended to allow multiple bands and large order in @xmath13 . � this extends on the work of ref where the authors calculated a similar expansion keeping terms of order @xmath12 in the presence of a magnetic field . the point of inflection around @xmath133 heals gradually . at large interband coupling � both gaps look similar to a one band solution . � the critical temperature of the system evolves smoothly out of the largest critical temperature , @xmath77 , and is enhanced by the interband coupling .    in the gl model � there are significant differences for both the gaps below @xmath126 . � the large deviation persists for weaker interband couplings despite including larger @xmath0 corrections . � this issue is significant when @xmath120 is close to the critical temperature @xmath5 . in this case � the range of validity of the gl solution to the gaps below @xmath120 is unreliable , and therefore care must be taken when applying the gl model to multiband superconductors . � this issue is significant when the interband coupling is larger or when one of the gaps is very dominant , the gl solution performs much better and including higher order terms can make the solution close to the bcs value over a large temperature range . � the range of validity of the gl solution can be extremely small . � the gl solution to the gaps below @xmath120 is unreliable , and therefore care must be . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ t. yoshida , m. hashimoto , i.m . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ vishik , z -

backward directions at large energies , and is also logarithmically growing at large energies at fixed scattering angles .     the total cross section is the sum of the contribution from the individual modes . branching fractions for the subsequent decays of the @xmath2 bosons     branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons     branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons     branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons    branching fractions for unpolarized photons have not been included in the figures or tables .    branching fractions for unpolarized photons there is a factor of one half from averaging over the initial helicities . in figures 3 and 4   branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons    branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons    branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons    branching fractions for the @xmath2 bosons    we emphasize that the angular cut is not particularly effective at reducing the continuum background at @xmath40 gev where the background is fairly flat in @xmath41 .    the angular cut for the heavier higgs where the signal is less dominant over the background .                one sees from figure 4 that as the higgs mass rises from @xmath48 to @xmath49 gev , the decreasing prominence of the higgs peak together with the increasing underlying continuum production of @xmath2 s causes the background to become larger than the signal . to obtain event rates one must multiply by the @xmath2 appropriate branching fractions and include the photon - photon luminosity distribution                , however , one can already deduce that for a higgs as heavy as @xmath49 gev , one needs a large number of events since the background is over three times the size of the peak at its maximum . tev . � the photon -

back behavior becomes more evident and the angular cut has a pronounced effect ( see figure 3 ) .    it is possible that the ability to see the higgs peak above the @xmath93 background can be improved by employing more refined techniques@xcite .    the benefits of polarized photon beams and cuts on the decay products of the @xmath2 s can be used to enhances the longitudinal component of the signal over the transverse background .    it is possible that since we have obtained the individual helicity amplitudes , we can incorporate the decay density matrices for the @xmath2 bosons and recover the full spin correlations of the decay products . in any case    it seems unlikely that these methods could change the basic conclusion that the higgs is unobservable above @xmath2 s can be used to enhances the longitudinal component of the signal over the transverse background .    it seems unlikely that these this background into consideration .        the large size of the @xmath44 background casts doubt on the viability of the process @xmath0 as a `` quantum counter , '' since any signal is probably buried beneath the standard model @xmath1 boson loop contribution .         the benefits of polarized photon beams and cuts on the decay products of the @xmath2 bosons in detecting a heavy higgs including the continuum background considered here is a subject for future study .                                                                                                               this research was supported in part by the university of wisconsin research committee with funds granted by the wisconsin alumni research foundation , in part by the u.s . xmath5 collider , '' northwestern university preprint nuhep -

beam evaporation in order to absorb the pump pulse laser light .  embodiments a schematic of the sample used in this study is shown in fig .  embodiments a @xmath2 @xmath0 m as can be seen in fig . � [ figure1]b . to excite acoustic waves in the substrate , pump laser light � is focused on the @xmath3 nm aluminum layer . in all experiments � , the plane of the sample surface is oriented vertically .    in the laser - induced spallation experiments , � the pump light ( 1064 nm wavelength , @xmath5 ns pulse duration ) is focused to a spot size of approximately @xmath6 mm diameter ( determined by burn marks on zap - it paper ) . � since the excitation ablates the energy - absorbing aluminum layer , new monolayer positions are tested after each pump pulse . to calculate the force acting on the monolayer , � surface displacements are monitored with a michelson interferometer , which consists of an argon laser ( @xmath7 nm wavelength , continuous wave ) focused on the @xmath8 nm aluminum layer and the reference beam focused on a stationary mirror , to a spot with an estimated diameter of approximately @xmath9 @xmath0 m ( at 1/e^2^ intensity level ) . because the microspheres scatter the probe light , surface displacements are recorded on a xmath12 mj pump pulse . @@@@@@@@ we observe the arrival of an acoustic pulse of greater than @xmath13 ns duration traveling at the longitudinal sound speed in the glass . @@@@@@@@ we obtain the acceleration of the substrate by numerically differentiating the measured substrate displacement twice , and applying numerical smoothing to the displacement , velocity , and acceleration signals @xcite . @@@@@@@@ an example of such an acceleration profile , corresponding to a pump energy of @xmath12 mj , is shown in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ figure1]c .    to calculate the force acting at the particle - substrate contact , @@@@@@@@ we employ a simple model that accounts for the inertia of the microspheres and considers the microspheres to be rigid bodies that follow the substrate surface motion until detachment @xcite . @@@@@@@@ we calculate the force applied to the contact as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the microsphere mass , calculated using a density provided by the manufacturer ( corpuscular , inc . ) of @xmath16 g / m^3^ , and @xmath17 is the measured substrate acceleration . @@@@@@@@ this type of model is valid when the pulse duration is significantly longer than the period of the microsphere contact @xmath18 mj . @@@@@@@@ this corresponds to an adhesive force , averaged between @xmath18 mj and @xmath12 mj , of @xmath19 @xmath0n . @@@@@@@@ the magnitude of the error bars in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ figure2 ] is the maximum of the difference between the smoothed and unsmoothed acceleration signals , multiplied by the microsphere mass @xcite . as such @@@@@@@@ , we note that the amplitude of the error bars do not account for inaccuracies that may result from fast changes in the substrate motion and the use of the inertial model , for instance , in the case of resonant particle removal where the rigid body assumption no longer holds .     maximum tensile force induced at the microsphere contact as a function of laser pump energy . @@@@@@@@ the shaded region indicates pump energies where microsphere detachment was observed.,width=8 ]           after the spallation experiments , the sample is examined using a sem . @@@@@@@@ images of the post - spallation monolayer are shown for different pump energies in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ figure3 ] . @@@@@@@@ [ figure3 ] . @@@@@@@@ Throughout the monolayer @xcite , it is not surprising that some patches of monolayer remain adhered to the surface near the onset of microsphere removal .    we also observe that detached monolayer flakes resettle on the sample surface .     the resettling of ejected particles has been observed previously by others @xcite , despite the plane of the sample s surface being oriented vertically .    we speculate that this was explained by the slowing of ejected particles by the stokes drag in air , while long range attractive forces eventually cause some particles to re - adhere to the surface @xcite .     we find that almost all of the delaminated flakes are composed of single hcp crystalline domains .     we suggest that fracture of the monolayer into flakes is the result of interparticle decohesion along the weak boundaries that develop during the spallation process . in previous spallation experiments with continuous , ductile thin films ,    we found that the excessive stress tended to lead to large scale plastic deformation in the film manifested by `` blister '' formation following the film delamination @xcite .     we speculate that the ordering of the mon at an amplitude significantly below the microsphere detachment threshold , as shown in fig . � [ figure4]a . � [ figure4]b . � the out -

correlation of stock returns decays exponentially with a very short characteristic correlation time , which is in the range of a few minutes @xcite . � this is understood as a signature of market efficiency@ : since the tradings do not happen simultaneously , the values of the returns have also to be defined for the time intervals between the tradings . according to the rules of the stock exchanges we have considered the price as constant between two changes is no transaction for one of the stocks ( or for both ) such that the return results in a zero contribution to the total correlations . @xmath23 of the points in order to have the same problem as with the original data sets that the jumps do not occur at the same time in the different time series . � it is apparent from fig.[artificial ] . � it is apparent from fig.[artificial ] . � that increasing the time difference , @xmath13 helps identifying the time of maximum correlation . � the fact that we dropped random points from the original data changes slightly the position of the maximum correlation as compared to eq.([anal_artific ] ) . � it is apparent from fig.[artificial ] . � the decay of the correlation function is not exponential as in eq.([anal_artific ] ) but it decays approximately linearly down to the noise level . � this is due to the averaging procedure we use with the increased time difference , @xmath13 . � the correlation corresponding to larger time difference @xmath24 can be written as the weighted sum of the one - step correlation functions , @xmath25 , which belongs to @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the return belonging to one second time difference . � it is apparent from fig.[artificial We have studied the correlation of 195 companies , which were traded during the available 54 days more than 15000 times , namely how can we choose a smaller value for @xmath12 than for @xmath13 ? � the time dependent cross correlation of the returns contains a product of the _ return _ of company a with that of company b shifted by @xmath12 . � as the return is defined with the window @xmath30 the values of @xmath31 could only be multiples of @xmath13 . � the solution is simply that one shifts the starting point of the return of company b by @xmath12 , as evident in eq . � the solution is simply that we make the time shift in the price function ( [ correl_average ] ) , i.e. we make the time shift in the price function and in this way allow any time shift larger than the minimum trading time . � the above arguments of averaging give support to choose a value for @xmath13 that is larger than the minimum trading time . � however , it should not be too large since the averaging leads then to the smearing out of the maximum . as the width of the one - step correlation should be a few minutes for correlations in return values because of market efficiency .    in fact , using such a large value for the time shift allows us to measure the noise level , which the possible effect should be compared with .    for the resulting 195 * 194/2 correlation functions we measured the maximum value , @xmath35 , the position @xmath36 at which time shift this maximum was found , and the ratio , @xmath37 , of the maximum and strength of the noise defined as the variance of the correlation values for time shift values between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .     for the resulting 195 * 194/2 correlation functions we measured the maximum value , @xmath40 , the position @xmath36 at which time shift this maximum was found , and the ratio , @xmath37 , of the maximum and strength of the noise defined as the variance of the correlation values for time shift values between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .     for the resulting 195 * 194/2 correlation functions we looked at those pairs of companies for which these three values exceeded a prescribed threshold values , which we defined for @xmath40 as : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @x closer inspection revealed that in such cases the peak in the correlation function is caused by two major return values in the considered time series . is consistent with the effective market hypothesis .    in this paper we found that a time shift larger than the characteristic time of the decay of the return auto - correlations would contradict with the efficient market picture and could be used to arbitrage .    in this paper we found that in general the more frequently traded companies are influencing ( `` pulling '' ) the less frequently traded ones .    in this paper we found that this is not surprising since obviously the more frequently traded companies are more important .    in this paper we found that in general the more frequently traded companies are influenced by many `` large '' companies and it is therefore more likely that they influence a smaller company than the other way around .    in this paper we found that although this is the generic situation , there are a few exceptions when a less often traded company `` pulls '' the other one .    in this study we found that in general one `` small '' company is influenced by many `` large '' companies and one `` large '' company pulls many `` small '' ones . as can be seen in fig .    in this paper we found that in the case of `` pulling '' [ arrow ] this behaviour can be represented as a graph of directed links , where there ( e.g. one of the company s operation depends on the other . ) . in this case \u001c the price change of the influenced stock appears later in time because it needs some time to react on the price change of the first stock , in other words one of the stocks pulls the other . \u001c this pulling effect has been the main focus of our study in this article . to the so called stylized facts . of course \u001c , further analysis on more extensive data is needed to clarify further details of the time dependent cross correlations . \u001c * acknowledgment : * we are grateful to a. l. barabsi for discussions , to soon -

lvea_seisz , at the central building at the ligo hanford observatory ( lho ) . � one class of seismic events were characterized using a program called _ glitchmon _ � the data was band - passed filtered ( 2 to 20 hz ) , and events of magnitude @xmath2 and larger were designated as vetoes . � the seismic events were observed with a seismometer , h0:lsc - lvea_seisz , at the central building at the ligo hanford observatory ( lho ) . same seismometer , h0:pem - lvea_seisz . for the generation of the dq flag \u001c the data was band - pass filtered from 3 to 10 hz . \u001c the root mean square ( rms ) of the data was calculated , and periods when the rms was large were excluded . it is believed that this veto is effective in identifying periods when gravel trucks were driving in the vicinity of lho , plus other seismic events . \u001c [ fig1 ] shows a time series of one of these seismic events , along with the data from the gravity wave output channels of the h1 ( h1:lsc - as_q ) and h2 ( h2:lsc - as_q ) interferometers ; this signal is consistent with what is observed due to passing gravel trucks . \u001c this dq flag will exclude about 1.5% of the s3 h1 data , and its use percentage is 53% . \u001c it has been observed that there is an increase in _ glitches _ in the as_q channels of the interferometers for some hours after people have entered the enclosures housing the dark output ports of the interferometers ; this signal is consistent with what is observed dip was defined as a decrease in light level , relative to the average over the previous ten seconds , of at least 15% for l1 or 5% for h1 or h2 . during the s3 playground period  s3 , there were nine observed light dips at l1 , with four of the times associated with inspiral triggers .  perspect [ fig2 ] shows an example of one such event . in h1  perspect , there were no light dips identified during playground times that were filtered for inspiral triggers . in h2 , there were three dips identified during playground times that were filtered , and two of these corresponded to actual inspiral triggers .  perspect much work went into identifying signals from interferometer channels or environmental monitors that were consistently associated with inspiral triggers . starting with the inspiral triggers from the s3 playground all of the relevant channels were examined by eye , using numerous different filters . when candidate veto channels were identified veto triggers were generated using glitch finding algorithms .  perspect the glitchmon program  @xcite , mentioned above , was used .  perspect the glitchmon program  @xcite , mentioned above , was used .  perspect in addition , _ kleinewelle _  perspect ( kw )  @xcite from h2 displayed in fig . al triggers with snr @xmath5 . � the s3 h2 veto triggers from channel h2:lsc - prc_ctrl were created using the kw program  @xcite . � the data were first high - pass filtered at 70  hz and then whitened . � the resulting kw triggers had a threshold _ significance _ � @xcite of 1600 ; the significance is a function of the probability of randomly detecting an event with greater signal energy in perfect white noise . � the veto window again extended from 1s before the trigger to 10s after it . with these settings 26% of all s3 h2 inspiral triggers in the playground data � the veto was vetoed , with a deadtime of 0.6% and a veto efficiency of 66% . � the veto efficiency was 40% for s3 h2 inspiral triggers with snr  @xmath5 . � the _ safety _ of a veto is of paramount importance . � we would not want to throw away a real gravitational wave event . � vetoes that have a small likelihood of eliminating gravitational wave signals are called _ safe_. as such , we looked closely at candidate veto channels during hardware injections ( simulated h2:lsc - prc_ctrl are basically equivalent .    with h2 inspiral events they also tend to veto the same events , so using both together as a veto does not increase the efficiency .    with the lsc s3 burst event search for h2 will use h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as a veto  @xcite . in an attempt to be consistent with the use of vetoes we are considering the choice of h2:lsc - prc_ctrl as the s3 h2 inspiral veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    with h1 inspiral events we are considering the use of channel h1:lsc - as_i as a veto .    while h1:lsc - asq_q is linearly related to the gravitational wave strain , h1:lsc - as_i contains information on optical imbalances and mirror misalignments .     our investigations of the loudest inspiral triggers in the s3 h1 playground revealed significant coincident disturbances in the two channels resulting from the radio veto we put restrictions on the relative amplitudes of glitches in both channels ( as_i and � as_q ) compared to the relative amplitude of the simulated gravitational wave signals .     we compared the energy of the kw triggers in as_i and as_q during the injection times to establish a safe ratio between glitches and `` real signals '' with those channels .     we also imposed a minimum energy threshold on the as_i kw triggers to reduce the deadtime incurred when applying this strategy , without reducing the efficiency significantly .    our criteria for creating a veto � was the following : we required as_i kw triggers to have as_q kw trigger counterparts ; we required a minimum energy threshold in the as_i kw triggers , and we required a safe ratio of energies in as_i and as_q .    the kw triggers that satisfied these conditions were considered veto candidates . in fig .    [ fig7 ] we plot the kw energy for as_i and as_q for 60 hardware injections of binary inspiral signals .     we looked for coincidences between our veto candidates and inspiral triggers and found that a large percentage were used successfully ratio of 2 , so a safe veto should have a threshold that is smaller .     has the smallest ratio ( @xmath7 ) between as_q and as_i , width=480 ]    though we looked carefully , no effective and safe veto was found for s3 inspiral events at l1 .    though we looked carefully , no effective and safe veto was found for s3 inspiral events at l1 .     l1:lsc - as_i was studied closely , as numerous glitches in the data were observed in coincidence with inspiral triggers .     however , the veto could not be demonstrated to be completely safe ; the ratio of kw energies for as_q and as_i glitches was comparable to the ratio for hardware injections .     the lsc is actively searching for binary inspiral signals in its s3 data .    we have identified a number of effective vetoes , as many interferometer control channels and environmental monitors were inspected during the times of inspiral triggers ( within the playground period of s3 ) . we have identified a number of effective data quality flags . in addition , we are applying vetoes to the inspiral triggers from h for the support of this research . the author s work is supported by national science foundation grant phy-0244357 . � et al _ 2004 _ nuclear instruments and methods in physics research a _ * 517 * 154 abbott b _ et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 082004 abbott b _ � et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 082004 abbott b _ � et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 122001 abbott b _ et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 102001 abbott b _ et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 102001 abbott b _ et al _ 2004 _ phys . � d _ * 69 * 122004 abbott b _ � et al _ 2004 _ limits on gravitational wave emission from selected pulsars using ligo data _ , gr - qc/0410007 , in press phys . � d _ * 69 * 122004 abbott b _ � lett abbott b _ � et al _ ( 2005 ) _ � search for gravitational waves associated with the gamma ray burst grb030329",

( 2009 ) for @xmath89 , the range of magnetic field strengths they considered .      we note that the molecular hydrogen fractions , past the turn  around epoch , are lower by more than an order of magnitude compared to the results of s08 .      this is in line with the observation of schleicher et  al .   ( 2009 ) that s08 had underestimated the destruction rate of @xmath40 .      the thermal evolution of the gas in the zero magnetic field case ( @xmath90 in the figures ) also agrees with the results of the one - zone models studied by omukai ( 2001 )         the most important new result of our analysis is the thermal state of the gas owing to the destruction of the @xmath40 in the collapsing halo for @xmath91 . ( 2001 ) ,  we show that the reaction rates are also affected by the presence of a background uv field .    in contrast , for @xmath94 , our analysis shows that the same result ( i.e. lack of any @xmath30 cooling ) can also be obtained by the dissipation of tangled magnetic fields .    in figures  4 and 5    , we show the heating and cooling rates during the collapse regime , for two values of the magnetic field , 1 and 4  ng , respectively . apart from a brief initial period ,  we show that when atomic cooling roughly balances adiabatic heating , the dominant heating and cooling processes in the @xmath94 case , in the collapse stage , are magnetic heating and @xmath40 cooling , respectively .    in contrast , for @xmath95 , the magnetic heating quickly becomes more important than magnetic heating , resulting in a rapid temperature drop at densities near @xmath95 ( see fig .  1 ) .    in contrast , for @xmath96 , as the halo collapses further , the gas begins to recombine and the ionized fraction decreases ( see fig .  1 )    in contrast , for @ gives rise to a higher ionization fraction ( fig .  3 ) , and therefore aids the formation of @xmath40 . assumption of flux  freezing . compared directly to their analysis as we use only a single value of spectral index ( @xmath74 ) here . � the upper limits from cmb on @xmath58 for this value of @xmath114 are considerably weaker ( lewis 2004 ) . � we note that the effect we discuss here might be pronounced for a larger @xmath114 for a given @xmath58 . � more detailed analysis would be required to directly compare our results with yamazaki et  al . � our analysis suggests that for @xmath115 , the fragmentation of collapsing halos could be prevented , and therefore this could be considered an independent upper bound on the value of @xmath58 . � the mass of the central object that forms in a collapsing proto  star , and therefore the mass of the central object can be approximated as follows : there exists a radius at which the mass accretion time  of @xmath116 equals the kelvin - helmholtz time scale @xmath117 for a proto  star , with the proto  stellar mass equal to the gas mass enclosed within this radius . for metal  free gas , @xmath117 is approximately @xmath118 years , with only a mild dependence on the fraction of halos at @xmath124 , which contain pristine , metal  free gas when they collapse , and which reside in regions of an unusually high initial seed magnetic field , may produce a smbh with a mass of up to @xmath125 .  embodiments the time available between @xmath126 and @xmath124 is @xmath127 yrs , allowing for a further growth in mass by a factor of @xmath128 at the e  folding time of @xmath129 , ( corresponding to eddington  limited growth at the radiative efficiency 10% ) .  embodiments hence , the @xmath130 bhs , produced through the primordial magnetic field , can indeed grow into the @xmath131 smbhs by @xmath126 .  embodiments the smallest total ( dark matter+gas ) mass that can collapse for @xmath132 is @xmath133 ( as mentioned in section  3 above ) .  embodiments these halos could form either as a result of gravitational instability in the standard @xmath134cdm model , or via pmf  induced density perturbations ( for details on the latter scenario , see e.g. sb08 ) .  embodiments the abundance of halos at @ xmath138 , the abundance of halos above the same mass drops sharply to @xmath139 . it is worth emphasizing two important differences in these two scenarios . first , as figure  1 shows , even though there is a clear critical @xmath8field value , dividing the thermal evolution into two different regimes , even for @xmath8field strengths below this value , the minimum temperature reached by the gas is significantly elevated . � hence , sub  critical magnetic fields can still significantly increase the mass of the central object . � second , the gas in the halos must remain essentially free of any metals and dust , in order to avoid fragmentation . � this may well be impossible to reconcile with the large required flux , which has to arise from a close neighbor galaxy , in the uv  irradiation scenario . � on the other hand , in the magnetic  heating case , there is a - priori reason why a region where the pmf has an upward fluctuation would be more likely to be metal enriched . � in fact , quite the contrary : the large magnetic jeans mass will suppress the collapse of gas into lower  redshift . � we found a plausible novel mechanism to form high - redshift smbhs by direct gas collapse in early dark matter halos , aided by heating from the dissipation of a primordial magnetic field math154 , would produce the same effect as the @xmath8field utilized here . ============ interestingly , our model requires a magnetic field strength that is close to the existing observational upper limits . ============ we therefore expect that the values @xmath155 , required to form smbhs , could be detectable by the future cmb experiments . ============ the upward fluctuations of such a strong primordial magnetic field might also leave their trace on cosmic structure formation : because of the high magnetic field mass in these regions , the formation of dwarf  galaxy sized halos , with masses below @xmath156 , will be prevented . ============ we expect this can lead to further constraints on our smbh  formation scenario , analogous to constraints on warm dark matter models ( which produce a similar suppression of small - scale structures ; barkana , haiman & ostriker 2001 ) . ============ zh thanks the raman institute for their hospitality , where this work was initiated , and the american physical society for travel support . ============ we also thank biman nath for many fruitful discussions . ============ ( corresponding to the mean density at redshift @xmath157 ) and ending at the turnaround just below @xmath158 . ============ the right panel follows the subsequent temperature",

( 1998 , hereafter lhba ) data showed that e  is a merger ( t98 ) .    below we present results from the  observation of e  performed in october 2000 .     we use @xmath3  and @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 mpc at the cluster redshift . @xmath9c for a useful exposure of 24.3 ks . to derive the gas temperature for a given region of the cluster image , � the telescope and detector response were modeled as described in mv . � the acis background rate did not vary during the exposure , but was higher than expected by a factor of about 1.3 , most likely due to anomalous `` space weather '' . � this required special background modeling . to do this , � we extracted a spectrum from the acis - i region outside an @xmath10 ( @xmath11 mpc ) circle centered on the cluster , which should be free of cluster emission . point sources were excluded . � the observed excess over the nominal background was well - modeled in the @xmath12 kev band by the sum of two power laws @xmath13 with photon indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( dominant below and above @xmath16 kev , respectively ) originating inside the detector , i.e. , without applying mirror effective area and ccd efficiency to the model . � the observed excess is rare and not yet understood . � the observed excess over the nominal background was well - modeled in the @xmath12 which was applied to the model background image .    this is of course consistent with the above spectral correction .    a 10% background uncertainty was included in deriving the confidence intervals for all quantities .    this approximate background modeling is adequate for our present qualitative study .    to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties ,    the spectra were extracted in the @xmath18 kev energy band , excluding the @xmath19 kev interval around the mirror ir edge .    the acis image of the cluster is shown in fig .    the acis image of the cluster is shown in fig 1_a_. it shows a `` bullet '' apparently just exiting the cluster core and moving westward .     this subcluster was previously seen in the  data ( e.g. , t98 ) , but the high resolution  image makes its nature and direction of motion clear . the bullet is preceded by an x - ray brightness edge that resembles a bow shock . to determine whether it is indeed a shock ( and not a `` cold front '' , e.g. , markevitch et al .  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2000 ) , below we derive the gas temperatures on both sides of abundance of @xmath23 solar , fixing the absorption at @xmath24  as derived by lhba from radio and  pspc data .    this temperature agrees with their  +  fit of @xmath25 kev and is consistent with the @xmath26 kev  fit by t98 . and the local gas temperature ( in addition to the general similarity to the x - ray brightness , e.g. , lhba ; govoni et al . \u001c 2001 ) was noticed by mv in two other merging clusters and supports the merger shock origin for the relativistic halo electrons ( e.g. , tribble 1993 ) .  embodiments the temperature map confirms that the western x - ray brightness edge is a shock front .  embodiments we can derive its mach number from either the temperature or density jump across the front using the rankine - hugoniot shock adiabat .  embodiments figure 4_a _ shows an x - ray brightness profile in a 120  sector centered on the bullet s center of curvature and directed along its apparent motion .  embodiments there are two brightness edges whose shapes indicate spherical gas density discontinuities in projection .  embodiments we fit this profile by the projection of a gas density model consisting of two power laws @xmath35 centered on the bullet representing the bullet gas and the shock region , respectively .  embodiments these are immersed in a @xmath36-model centered on the main cluster ( region _ j _ ) representing the outer , undisturbed gas .  embodiments all components are sp 3 ) ( 0.0,24.0)=8.7 cm    ( -0.04,19.7)=8.7 cm    ( -0.1,11.3 )    = 3.5mmfig .   2.projected gas temperature map ( colors ) overlaid on the x - ray brightness contours from fig .   2.projected gas temperature map ( colors ) overlaid on the x - ray brightness contours from fig .   2.projected gas temperature map ( colors ) overlaid on the x - ray brightness contours from fig .   1_b_. temperatures for individual regions are shown in lower panel ( region _ b _ is the tip of the bullet , unmarked in the map for clarity .   1_b _ in this region appears smaller than the bullet in the contour plot because of smoothing ) .    the errors in this figure are @xmath37 .    the horizontal line shows the cluster average temperature .    the best - fit density model is shown in fig .   4_b _ ; it describes the brightness profile in fig .   4_a _ well .   4 strictly speaking , the latter approximation applies only along the direction of the motion , but we can use it as a qualitative estimate for our wide sector ) . the observed temperature jump from @xmath47 kev to @xmath48 kev bullet .

The high gas density in the bullet ( fig .  4_b _ ) suggests that the bullet is a remnant of a density peak ( cooling flow ) that once was at the center of the merging subcluster , perhaps around its brightest galaxy ( fig .  4_b _ ) .       the subcluster s less dense outer gas was probably shocked and ram pressure stripped to the radius where the pressures are balanced ( see fig .  4 ) . mass . � however , the results presented here show that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in e  can easily overestimate the mass by a significant factor due to the ongoing merger and a temporary increase in temperature ( see , e.g. , simulations by ricker & sarazin 2001 and ritchie & thomas 2001 ) . � it is thus difficult to draw any strong cosmological conclusions without a better estimate of the cluster mass . � the unique shock and supersonic subcluster in e  enable several interesting measurements . � since the gas density and temperature jumps at the shock are related , their accurate measurement may give the equation of state for the intracluster plasma . � it is thus difficult to draw any strong cosmological conclusions without a better estimate of the cluster mass . � the unique shock and supersonic subcluster in e  enable several interesting measurements .    from the velocity of the bullet and the density of the ambient gas , we can derive the ram pressure on the bullet . � the gas bullet appears to be pushed away from the subcluster s dark matter potential well just now , so the gravitational pull of the subcluster should equal the ram pressure . � this may give of the gas distribution ) , one may determine whether the dark matter is collisionless , as are the galaxies , or if it experiences an analog of ram pressure , as does the gas .     the  observation of e  presents a prototypical example of a merger bow shock .    the shock propagates in front of a cooler gas `` bullet '' , apparently a remnant of a dense central region of the merging subcluster whose outer gas was stripped by ram pressure .     the subcluster mach number is 23 and its velocity is 30004000 .     the bullet is in the center of the merging subcluster and thus the subcluster traversed the main cluster core only 0.10.2 gyr ago .      the bullet is at the final stage of being destroyed by gas dynamic instabilities .     the bullet and its gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies due to the ram pressure of the shocked gas .      the hottest gas resides in a different region of e  where additional merging activity occurs .     the overall high temperature of e  is unlikely to represent its virial temperature due to the ongoing merger .     the",

      "generated": "fluidized beds consist of granular particles confined in a tall chamber with distributor for the fluid flow at the bottom . when the flow rate of fluid exceeds the critical value , particles start moving .<n> this state is called the fluidized phase , which contains sub phases , for instance , the homogeneous , bubbling , channeling , etc . in this paper , a numerical model of fluidized bed is proposed , where hydrodynamic interaction among particles is calculated with reliable accuracy . we present the results of our systematic simulations of fluidized beds , where hydrodynamic interaction among particles is calculated with reliable accuracy . we observe the transition of fluidization and the existence of two fluidized phases .<n> we also discuss statistical quantities , which are analogous to equilibrium correspondences , and interpret the averaged quantities by the hole theory for simple liquids . fluidized beds have been widely used for the treatment of various kinds of diseases , such as cancer@xcite , diabetes@xmath0 , andlzlz(lz ) .<n> however , it is still an open problem to determine the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the relaxation process of the sedimentation velocity of a single particle in a viscous fluid . in this paper , we propose a method of the simulation of the relaxation of sedimentation velocity to the terminal velocity with the aid of the method of stokesian dynamics , where the hydrodynamic interaction among particles is considered in 3-dimensional space . the relaxation time - scale @xmath1 is determined by the choice of the system size and the parameters related to the artifact situations of our simulations . <n> it is well - known that the relaxation rate of a fluidized bed depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the particle size . for example , the superficial velocity conventionally used for fluidizedbeds has a logarithmic dependence on the stokes number . on the other hand ,<n> we show that a linear dependence is observed in the case of non - zero viscosity and small system size , when the hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account , even when the viscosity is small  we perform simulations to investigate the behavior of confined mobile particles interacting hydrodynamically . we focus on the effects of the flow rate and the effective stokes number @xmath0 on the phase behavior .<n> we find that the fixed phase at low flow rate behaves as a channel or a path of fluid flow , while at high flow rate , particles are in a fluidized phase . in the channel - bubble transition region , we observe a qualitatively different behavior of statistical quantities such as the kinetic energy per particle and the fraction of fluidized particles , as compared with the case of fixed particles in 3-dimensional space . <n> it has been a long - standing problem whether or not the fluidization transition in a confined system occurs in a simple way , i.e. , according to the stokes law @xcite , or whether it is a continuous or a discontinuous transition , which is a question which has not been well understood yet . to answer this question ,<n> we study a system of mobile non - interacting particles confined in a 3-dimensional unit cell , where hydrodynamic interactions are considered , and compare the results with those of 3-dimensional simulations and with the experimental results . for the parameters related to the system we perform galilei simulations of a one - dimensional model of channel - bubble transition .<n> we find that the transition of fluidization qualitatively changes from a channel to a bubbling phase for large @xmath0 . in the fluidized phase<n> , we observe the free volume around the mobile particles , which is qualitatively different from that in the fixed phase where the particles are supported by a fixed support . <n> the transition between a fluidized and a non - fluidized state is one of the most fundamental transitions in nonlinear dynamics . on the one hand ,<n> it is closely related to the mechanism of transport of particles and fluidization by gravity @xcite , on the other hand it is believed to occur in a wide variety of physical systems , such as porous media , chemical reactions , and biological systems . the transition from a fluid state to another state , the so - called _ fluidization transition _ , has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally . however , it is still an open question whether the transition is a continuous or a discontinuous one . to answer this question , in this letter we perform simulations to investigate the transition in a model of one - dimension with a gali we report the observation of the transition of fluidization in a one - dimensional suspension of hard spheres .<n> the transition occurs between a bubbling phase and a channel phase . in the bubbling phase ,<n> the free volume around the particles is generated and the mobile particles do not support the fixed particles . on the other hand , in the channel - bubble transition , a gap between the mobile and fixed particles causes the rayleigh - taylor instability and then the gap may grow into a bubble and propagate through the particles , or may construct a channel . <n> when a fluid of hard particles is suspended in a bath of soft ones , it undergoes a transition from a suspension to a fluid phase@xcite . at first<n> , the transition between the two phases can be understood as a transition between a dilute suspension and a dense one with a fixed number of particles ; see , e.g. , refs . [ fig : cofm - vari - st ] and [ fig - config - bubble ] for the cases in which the transition is observed . here<n> we show that the transition also occurs between two different phases , namely , bubbling and channel , as observed in ref . we investigate the phase behavior of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) gas of non - interacting hard - sphere particles in a channel - like configuration . in the previous paper @xcite , we have shown that the system exhibits two phases : a channeling phase and a bubbling phase . here<n> we show that the corresponding transitions are also observed in the physical quantities corresponding to the channel - bubble transitions .<n> we find that the relative motion of particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system , and that the bubbles are always accompanied by the convective motion of the particles . <n> the behavior of gases in channels is one of the most important topics in the study of nonlinear dynamics . for example , in fluid dynamics<n> , it is well known that a channel can be collapsed by the action of gravity . on the other hand ,<n> in non - linear dynamics , there are many kinds of transitions between different phases , such as phase transitions between the ordered state and the disordered state , phase transitions from the ordered phase to the disordered phase , etc.@xcite in this paper , by studying a 1d gas of particles , in a recent paper , we have shown that the relative motion of tracer particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system . in the bubbling phase , bubbles are always accompanied by the convective motion of particles . from the previous paper @xcite and the simulation in fig . <n> [ fig : cnf - b266f3-convex ] , the response time @xmath0 of the velocity for the change of configurations is shown to behave as the effective temperature of the environment such as that of the heat bath for equilibrium systems .<n> we also find surprising correspondences in statistical quantities between fluidized beds which is in highly nonequilibrium states and quasi equilibrium systems such as liquid . we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the diffusion - limited diffusion of brownian particles in a fluidized bed . we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity is well described by the einstein relation or the fluctuation - dissipation relation in fluidized beds .<n> the arrhenius function is also found in our simulations . <n> brownian particle diffusion is a fundamental problem in physics , chemistry , and biology . in condensed matter physics<n> , brownian motion is closely related to the transport coefficients , such as the viscosity and the diffusivity , which are defined in terms of the particle s resistance@xcite . for brownian systems ,<n> it is well known that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the resistance in the equilibrium state . on the other hand , in a nonequilibrium system , the transport coefficient is usually not proportional to its resistance , because the system is in a highly nonequilibrium state and there is no reason of the existence of a self - consistent relation between transport coefficients in a linear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . as a result , it is important to consider the viscosity as a measure of the nonequilibrium correlations in a system in equilibrium . recently , there has been a we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the non - gaussian property of the shear viscosity in a compressible granular material . we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity obeys the arrhenius function , which is consistent with the experimental result in fluidized beds@xcite .<n> we also find that both the velocity distribution functions and the effective viscosity obey non - gaussianity . <n> non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is a powerful tool to study the properties of granular materials . in equilibrium<n> statistical mechanics , a granular material can be divided into two parts : a _ dense liquid _ and an _ elastic liquid_. in a dense fluid , the _ shear viscosity _ @xmath0 is proportional to the flow rate , while in a elastic liquid , it depends on the shear rate only . for a dilute system ,<n> the former decreases with the increase of the density , whereas the latter increases with the decrease of the mean free path of the velocity field . as a result , in the dilute limit , @xxmath1 , where the gauss law is valid , and the latter is equal to the sum of the two quantities molecular dynamics simulation is performed to investigate the behavior of a bed of fluidized beds in a simple liquid . we find that the effective viscosity is almost constant in the channeling phase and that the height of the center of mass behaves as @xmath0 .<n> we demonstrate that the qualitative understanding of the simulation results is possible with the aid of the hole theory applied to simple liquids . <n> it is well known that a fluid can be divided into two phases : the solid phase and the liquid phase @xcite . in the fluid phase ,<n> the average behavior of molecules is described by the gibbs - thomson law . on the other hand , in the liquid<n> , the behavior can be understood by the fermi - pasta - ulam model , which is based on the translational invariance of the system . when a molecule moves in a liquid , it can move when a free volume or a hole is generated around it . from this picture , a molecule can move in a fluidized bed , and the average of the molecule s position as a function of the flow rate of the liquid is known as the kuramoto law , where the viscosity is proportional to the diffusivity using molecular dynamics simulations , we study the phase diagram of a one - dimensional fluidized bed in a channel . in experiments ,<n> the fluidization transition seems to be discontinuous .<n> although the simulations suggest a continuous phase transition , it is difficult to understand the experimental data without some additional assumptions . <n> recently , experiments have been performed to study the behavior of channel structures in a liquid @xcite , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , and a mixture of two supercooled liquids . while in experiments the bec and the channel are connected by a narrow channel , in the simulations the channel is two - dimensional ( 2d ) with a finite height @xmath0 in the middle , which is called the bed of fluidization . at the channel top , where the viscosity is approximately proportional to the temperature , the system behaves as a simple liquid , while in the bottom of the channel the system is a superfluid@xcite or a mott insulator . since the first realization of the fluidized beds in experiments@xmath1 , there has been great interest in the phase behavior of these systems . the phase transition between the superfluid and the recent experiments have shown that a fluidized bed behaves as a simple liquid@xcite . in order to understand the behavior of fluidized beds , we have carried out numerical simulations with the use of a computer .<n> we have found two fluidized phases , _ the channeling phase _ and _the bubbling phase_, where the former changes to the latter as the stokes number @xmath0 increases . we have defined the effective viscosity with the aid of the einstein relation , and we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity is similar to that in the experiments in real fluidizedbeds . the effective temperature plays the role of the fluidization temperature . <n> # 1@xmath1#1 there has been a growing interest in fluidization due to the recent experiments on simple liquids@x<n> . however , the nature of fluidization in simple liquids has not been understood well so far . for simple liquids , it is well known that the behavior is independent of the control parameters such as the flow rate and the viscosity . on the other hand ,<n> it is not clear whether or not the phase transition observed in experiments is a discontinuous phase transition . here<n> we will show in this paper we study the behavior of a fluidized bed , which is a system of inelastic particles confined in a box .<n> we find that the viscosity is an index of the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity , similar to that in the experiments in real fluidized beds . this index of non - gaussian property in velocity distribution of particles<n> is consistent with the behavior on granular materials or the system of elastic particles . qualitative behavior of fluidizedbeds such as @xmath0 and @xcite can be understood by means of the hole theory which has been used for simple liquids . <n> pacs numbers : : 47.50.+d , 05.40.+j , 47.54.+r in recent years there has been a growing interest in the properties of granular materials . in particular , it has been realized that a granular material such as a bed of granular particles can be made by cooling a fluid down to a very low temperature@xcite . at the same time<n> , there is an increasing interest in understanding the behavior in simple liquids such as colloidal suspensions , emulsions , polymers , etc . for simple fluids ,<n> it is well known we perform molecular - dynamics simulation of fluidized beds composed of colloidal particles .<n> hydrodynamic interaction among particles through the fluid is taken into account under the stokes approximation , and collisional inelasticity is modeled by elastic collisions . it is found that the hydrodynamic interaction is the essential mechanism of the fluidized bed , which is different from the case of dense colloidal particles in dilute solution . <n> a colloidal particle immersed in a fluid behaves as a bed in the sense that the bed is composed of the particles which are immersed in the fluid , but the particles are not in contact with each other . in dense colloidal suspensions ,<n> particles are strongly coupled to the fluid because of the strong hydrodynamic interaction between the particles and the fluid @xcite . because of this strong interaction , colloidal particles are unable to move freely in the colloidal fluid . on the other hand , in dilute solutions of colloidal fluids , the particles can freely move due to the friction between the fluid and the colloidal particles @xmath0 . to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of colloidal colloidal particles<n> , it is necessary to introduce the concept of the bed in colloidal systems , because the bed can be understood as a system in which the particles interact with the we study the hydrodynamics of dense colloidal particles confined in a fluidized bed .<n> the particles interact with each other by the stokes force and also with the long - range forces due to the interaction with the wall of the chamber . using the ewald summation technique , we construct the resistance relation between the mobile and the fixed particles , which is formulated by the pairwise - additive manner from the two - body lubrication matrix . in the dilute limit , @xmath0 ,<n> the resistance matrix is constructed by the multipole expansion . on the other hand , in the real fluidized beds , the chamber has two contributions which are to bound the fluid by the vertical wall and to support the particles by the bottom . we introduce the contribution of bounding the fluid in terms of the periodic boundary condition . <n> hydrodynamics is one of the most fascinating subject in the study of colloidal particles @xcite . to understand the motion of a colloidal particle , it is necessary to take into account not only its internal dynamics but also its external one , such as confinement , buoyancy , etc . for a dense colloidal particle<n> , there are two kinds of forces acting on the particle : the friction in a previous paper [ phys . rev . lett . * 102 * , 056801 ( 2009 ) ] , we have shown that the relaxation time of a bed in a two - phase fluidized system is inversely proportional to the resistance of the system . in the present paper ,<n> we show that this result is incorrect .<n> we find that the resistance relation that relates the relaxation times of the mobile and the fixed particles is false for the mobile particles only . for the fixed particle case<n> , the correct relation is found only when the inertia of the particles is taken into account . <n> pacs numbers : 87.10.+e , 05.70.ln , 47.20.ky 2 recently , there has been a growing interest in the problem of relaxation in non - equilibrium systems @xcite . from a fundamental point of view , it is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to the relaxation of a system from an initial state to a final steady state . to this end , in a series of papers , using both analytical and numerical methods , various relaxation processes have been studied in different systems , such as : _ non - we present a simulation study of the relaxation process of a small collection of particles in a fluidized bed .<n> we find that the particles relax to a steady state even in the case that the inertia of all forces acting on them balance . in this steady state ,<n> the particles form a cluster and relative motions among them almost disappear . <n> pacs numbers : 87.10.+e , 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r over the past few years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the dynamics of small particles in fluidized beds @xcite . for example , it has been understood that the motion of a particle in a bed is described by a langevin equation with an effective friction coefficient @xmath0 , which reflects the viscosity of the fluid and the friction between the particles . here<n> we show that the same kind of equation can be used to describe the relaxation of a collection of brownian particles in the presence of lubrication . using this model , we simulate the relaxation processes of a set of particles which move in a two - dimensional bed , each of which is in contact with the other particle . from the simulation results<n> we can extract the radial component gravity plays an important role in the lubrication of fluidized beds .<n> we have presented a model for the description of the lubrication , which can be understood as the renormalization of the singularity in the hydrodynamic interaction . in the calculation of the effective stokes number @xmath0 and the resistance of a tracer<n> , we introduce a cut - off length which may correspond to the height of the dimples on the surface or to the mean - free path of the molecules of the fluid . if particles approach with each other within the cut -off length , the gap between them is assumed to be the cutoff in calculation of hydrodynamic interactions . <n> it is well known that the gravity causes a singularity in lubrication in fluidized systems . for example , in the case of the shear flow with the gravity , when the volume fraction is smaller than a critical value , there is a singularity , because the particles collide before the mean surfaces contact . on the other hand ,<n> if there are some dimples in the surface of the particles , it is possible that the singularity is prevented from some mechanisms in the real systems , such as the continuous description of hydrodynamic interaction and the continuous calculation of interaction between particles .",

time . because of current conservation , the gluons are decoupled from each other and their longitudinal component actually decouples from physical observables . for a reasonable choice of the coupling constants , we obtain a glueball spectrum which is compatible with the lattice one , as well as with the mass spectrum predicted by constituent models . at the same time , our results are not in good agreement with the predictions of other glueball constituent models which rely on gluon -

called  relativistic '' quantum mechanics ( rm ) . the basic idea is to introduce in the space - time a particle interacting with a scalar field , and then to introduce a vector field in the matter sector , _<n> i.e. _ a relativistic particle . under the assumption that the hamiltonian of the theory commutes with the parity operator , physical states are then characterized by the same mass : this is a characteristic signature of @x.0-dimensional quantum mechanics . since the theory is still in its exploratory stage , it is not yet clear if rm can be considered a new method is presented to compute the spectrum of bound states of two- and three -

relativistic regime , in particular in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition , which is expected to take place at high energy densities in the heavy - ion collision ( hic ) regime . among the various approaches , the one based on the dyson - schwinger ( dos ) method is the most popular @x<n>  two - gluon bound states have been observed on the lattice in the large-@xmath0 limit of the dynamical @xmath1 . here<n> we show how to extend the analysis to the entire allowed range of spin quantum numbers .<n> the scalar and tensor glueballs are indeed the lightest states , which is natural in view of the present approach : they are made of a minimal number of constituent gluons . <n> bound states of two quarks and/or gluons have been a subject of intense study since the early days of the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . during the last few years , lattice qcd simulations have been performed in a large number of different dynamical models , starting from the simplest su(2 ) gauge theory , such as the non - linear sigma model ( nnm ) , to the strongly coupled @ xy model ( sxm ) and finally to qcd with dynamical fermions ( cqgm ) in the continuum limit . in the latter case<n> , the lattice data have been interpreted in terms of bound states with two constituent quarks or gluons ( sates ) at low momentum transfers ( @x we present a simple model able to describe bound states of two constituent gluons in @xmath0-@xmath1 gauge theory . it is based on a casimir scaling of the string tension , on a regge trajectory and on a weakly confining potential .<n> it is shown that such a model gives a very good description of the lattice data in the large-@xcite limit . <n> the study of bound states is one of the most important topics in qcd @xcite . in recent years<n> , a great effort has been devoted to the development of lattice simulations of qcd , in order to understand better the mechanism of confinement and confinement - deconfinement ( cd ) transitions . among the different approaches ,<n> the one based on the regge trajectories is the most successful : it allows to follow the evolution of the system from a pure gauge theory through to a qcd - like qcd and back . at the same time , it is also very successful in reproducing the phenomenology of the confined states , such as the mass spectrum and the confinement properties of the lowest lying states . as a consequence , the understanding of the confinement mechanism is also a very active field of we present an explicit construction of three -

defined permutation symmetry up to the three - dimensional glueball band , which is then used to study the properties of these states in an explicit two - gauge - invariant manner . as a first step ,<n> we show how to explicitly build all three gluon states in su(5 ) , with a totally antisymmetric charge conjugation , using a completely non -

body model with three adjoint sources . in a flux - tube picture ,<n> the three sources are linked by fundamental strings , and the mass spectrum of the model is given in table [ tab2 ] . <n> the search for glueballs has been one of the main topics in the study of three - body systems at large @xmath1 . as can be seen from the large-,@xcite and transverse - field , ( tf )<n> approaches , a large number of states have been found in the glueball mass spectrum . among them , there are scalar glueballs and pseudoscalar glueballs ( psbs ) , which are the lightest states in the tf approach , as well as glueballs that are not scalars , but are not tfs : the lightest state is a scalar psb , while the remaining ones are pseudoscalars . on the other hand , it is the mass spectrum of three - gluon glueballs is computed in the large-@xmath0 limit of a static three - body model , where the sources of the adjoint sources are the fundamental gluons , linked by fundamental strings , in the limit of large @xmath1 .<n> masses of the eigenstates are obtained by performing a variational computation with gaussian trial wave functions . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 14.40.aq the semiclassical approach to qcd is based on the use of a potential that can be written as a sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the mass of the lightest glueball . in this approach ,<n> the glueball mass is related to the number of gluons inside it , and can be computed as a function of its radial distance from the center of mass . at large distances , the radial part of the potential tends to zero , so that the two - body result is recovered . on the other hand , at small distances<n> , it can be approximated by a radially decreasing potential , leading to the introduction of an additional term in the potential in this short note , we review the main properties of the lightest four - gluon states in @xmath0-@xmath1 yang - mills theory , which have been obtained in a previous work . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the last years , a lot of effort has been devoted to the study of the properties of glueballs , glueballs made of two su(2 ) gluons , and their @xcite counterparts .<n> these states have been found to be rather light , with masses in the 10 - 10 kev range and intercepts in the 0.11 - 0.11 mev range . in the present work ,<n> we show how these properties can be computed in a different framework , in order to get a better understanding of these states and of their relation to other glueball states , as well as to other states that have been proposed in the literature as possible candidates for the lightest glueballs in qcd . as we will see , these states can be found in a wide range of models , from qcd to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and beyond : in particular we will concentrate on su we compute the spectrum of two - gluon glueballs in @xmath0-@xmath1 gauge theory .<n> we show that the scalar glueball mass obeys a simple scaling law and that the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs are gauge - group independent , in agreement with recent lattice results . <n> two gluons are the most fundamental degrees of freedom in qcd . in non - abelian gauge theories , such as yang - mills theory @xcite and qcd - motivated theories @x<n> , gluons can be identified by their contribution to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , which is a function of the gluon mass and the number of colors . as a consequence ,<n> a gauge - invariant hamiltonian can be written that describes the interaction of a pair of gluons in the vacuum of a given gauge group . at low energies , the interaction is perturbative , leading to the well - known schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) . on the other hand , at high energies nonperturbative interactions<n> can be studied in perturbation theory , as exemplified by the approach to q we propose a new scaling rule for gluelump and glueball masses in @xmath0-@xmath1 lattice qcd with gauge group su(2 ) .<n> the scaling argument allows to compute the corresponding masses within our model ; they compare very well with the lattice data as shown in table [ tab ] . <n> gluelumps are bound states of the gluonic field when a static , color adjoint , source , is added . only one constituent gluon is then necessary to form a color singlet . in this case , the hamiltonian is a scalar gluelump , whose lightest eigenstate has a mass equal to the string breaking length scale , while we find the lightest glueball to have a mass which is in good agreement with the lightest scalar glueball mass computed on the lattice , @xcite . the scalar glueballs , including highly excited ones , have been computed in the same model on the same lattice ; their masses have been found to be in very good agreement . for a static source in the gluon sector , a static adjoint string breaking energy is twice the gluelump mass , as found in the lattice study . * gluelump we present a dynamical model for the gluon spectrum in @xmath0-@xmath1 lattice gauge theory .<n> the model leads to predictions for the glueball and glue lump masses , which are in good agreement with recent lattice data . <n> = 10000 lattice qcd is currently one of the most powerful tools for the study of non - perturbative aspects of strong interactions @xcite . in particular<n> , it allows for a very accurate determination of the quark and gluon mass spectrum , as well as for a first look at strong interactions in the context of string theory , _<n> e.g. _ the so - called string phenomenology ( see , for example , refs . and references therein ) . on the other hand ,<n> non -perturbative phenomena , such as confinement and relativistic kinematics , are still poorly understood , although they are expected to play an important role in qcd . to this end , a great deal of work has been done in the last few years , both theoretical and experimental , with the aim of a better understanding of the strong interaction , and of its relation to qcd phenomenologies . we propose a simple model for the glueball spectrum based on the su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory .<n> the main feature of the model is that the mass spectrum is computed on the lattice , in a way that is independent of the chirality of the theory , but only dependent on the ratio of the cutoff to the mass of the lightest glueball . in this way , we are able to compare the lattice results with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory and other lattice simulations . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in our previous paper @xcite we have shown that a simple lattice model based on su(2 ) @xmath1 gauge theory can well reproduce the observed glueball mass spectrum , as well as all other known low - lying excitations of the standard model ( sm ) . to be more precise ,<n> we computed the spectrum of the light glueball masses on a lattice of size @x 0.11 fm , and found that the results are in good agreement with the experimental data . however , to our knowledge , this is the first attempt at a full lattice simulation of the glueballs on a non - perturbative lattice . here we propose a new class of effective field theories which describe qcd at finite temperature and zero quark chemical potential .<n> these theories are nonperturbative and have the same symmetries as those of qcd . in particular , they do not suffer from the problem of solving the dyson - schwinger equations , which is inherent in qcd theories . as an example<n> , we show that these effective theories can be used to describe finite - temperature qcd dynamics at finite baryon density . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is based on the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the early universe at temperatures and baryon chemical potentials @xmath0 mev . at these temperatures ,<n> qcd undergoes a phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at a temperature of about mev@xmath1 @xcite . the qgp is expected to be a state of deconfined quarks , gluons , and anti - quarks ( akks ) , each of which interacts with the standard - model gluons and quarks via the qcd - quark interaction , known as the effective interaction  we discuss the role of @xmath0 in the determination of the strong coupling constant of qcd .<n> in particular , we show that the recently measured value of the coupling constant can be understood in terms of the running coupling constant in the effective chiral lagrangian . <n> qcd @xcite is a theory that has been very successful in describing the non - perturbative properties of the nucleon . in this theory ,<n> the strong interaction is described by the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is a strongly interacting many - body theory . at low energies , the qgp undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined and chirally symmetric qcd phase , known as the qcd instanton phase transition ( qigt ) @x<n> . however , it is not clear how this phase transition is related to the transition to the chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) phase of the theory ; for example , there is no direct correspondence between the csbi phase transition and the qgt . on the other hand , at very high energies the strong interactions between quarks and gluons<n> are expected to be strongly coupled , we propose a simple extension of the standard model based on the assumption of a non - vanishing @xmath0 in the low energy effective action .<n> we show that , in this scenario , the standard - model gauge - boson masses and couplings are calculable in perturbation theory up to next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , while the coupling constants and masses are fixed by the requirement of gauge invariance . <n> the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite has been one of the most important achievements in particle physics of the last two decades . in the standard version of the model ,<n> the mass and mixing of the neutrinos are determined by the parameters of the lagrangian , which are the masses of the quarks and leptons , as well as the mixing angles of the two higgs doublets . however , it is well - known that the lepton mixing angles are not constrained by the neutrino oscillation data , and the neutrino masses are not directly observable . instead , measurements of the solar , atmospheric and terrestrial neutrino fluxes are used to estimate the neutrino mixing angles . for the terrestrial neutrinos , astrophysical and cosmological observations<n> have shown that the we present a model for the gluon mass spectrum in the small-@xmath0 limit , based on a non - perturbative treatment of the two - gluon interaction in the framework of a harmonic oscillator approximation .<n> the model includes a @xmath1 expansion up to a dimension - six order in the coupling constant , where the harmonic oscillator wave functions are computed with the lagrange mesh method ( lmm ) . in this model , the lowest - lying states of the gluons are predicted to be in a narrow band , with a mass below that of the nucleon , in agreement with lattice qcd results . <n> the study of the properties of the quark and gluon gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the major goals of present and future high - energy physics experiments . at present<n> , there are two main types of measurements : ( i ) the measurement of the production cross - section of hadrons at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , which is planned for the year 2020 , and ( ii ) studies of the structure of the qgp at the cern large hadron collider",

particle cooper - pair tunneling ( cpt ) theory @x<n> . however , this theory breaks down in the presence of strong electron - electron interactions , leading to a breakdown of the bcs theory of superconductivity . the cpt theory we present a self - consistent gap equation for the superconducting state of a two - band superconductor with rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling .<n> we find that the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath0 , is proportional to the gap , but the gap itself is not proportional to it , so the density -

zero gap that depends on both the energy and the field . for a uniform superconductor<n> , this we study a two - band hubbard model with interband repulsion .<n> this model describes a system of coupled two - dimensional electron gases , where each band has its own dispersion relation , but the rest of the system is in the uncoupled first band . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we show that when the interband coupling exceeds a critical value , a gap opens in the density of states , and this gap grows linearly with the temperature . at the critical point<n> , this linear behaviour persists up to a second order phase transition . <n> pacs numbers : 71.10.fd , 71.27.+a , 71.20.be 2 the study of strongly correlated electron systems has a long history @xcite . in one - band systems , such as the hubbard hamiltonian , the system can be tuned from a mott insulator to a superconducting state by applying an external magnetic field , or from a normal metal to a superconductor , depending on the relative strength of the electron and phonon interactions . on the other hand , in two - bands systems such as @xmath0he@xmath1@xcite or @ we study the stability of a spin - triplet @xmath0-wave superconductor in the presence of interband coupling between different bands .<n> we find that the critical temperature of the uncoupled first band is enhanced over that of the dominant band due to the coupling , regardless of sign . however , for the coupled first band , the enhancement is suppressed , so that the system remains in the spin - singlet ( sc ) state . <n> the recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron - based pnictide superconductors @xcite has opened up a new era in the study of high temperature superconducting ( hts ) materials . in these materials ,<n> the superconducting order parameter is determined by the coupling between the different conduction bands , which can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , depending on the crystal structure of the system . due to this interplay between the conduction bands<n> , there is a competition between the superconducting gap and the pairing interaction , leading to a rich phase diagram , in which the superconducting state becomes more and more incoherent as a function of doping , magnetic field , and pressure . the spin triplet ( sd ) we present a general method for extending the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) approximation to any order in the bcs - bec crossover region .<n> we show that there is only one coherence length near @xmath0 , and that the order parameters are proportional to each other , so there is a single length scale in the crossover region near the fermi surface . at the same time , there are only two coherence lengths near the band edges , which results in a unique length scale for the crossover . <n> recently , it has been shown @xcite that the crossover from bcs superconductivity ( sc ) at low temperatures to the bec at high temperatures can be described by an extended ginzberg - landa ( g-l ) equation ( el ) . in this paper<n> , we provide a general formalism for extending this approximation to arbitrary order . using the fact that the gap parameters in the sc and bec regions are identical ,<n> we are able to show that the extended g- l can be written in terms of only two parameters , the superconducting gap and the coherence length , both of which can be calculated from first principles . we present a generalization of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory up to @xmath0 in order to include two bands in a superconductor .<n> we find that the bcs solution is recovered to a good approximation to high order , while higher order corrections are consistent with the results of conventional gl theory , but do not produce a bcs - like singularity near the fermi level . in the one band case ,<n> we show that the lowest order corrections decay rapidly to zero , and we provide a simple expression for the magnitude of the next correction . <n> the ginzberg - landa ( g - l ) approximation @xcite is a useful tool for the study of superconductivity in the presence of disorder , with applications ranging from the prediction of the critical temperature of unconventional superconductors to the understanding of the electronic properties of cuprates . for a single band superconductor<n> this approximation is known to be accurate at low to moderate energies , where the dynamical fermi surface ( dds ) is well described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @x<n> . however it is not accurate at high energies or large separations between we study the critical behaviour of a two band hubbard model with an additional interband coupling .<n> we use a finite size expansion to calculate the critical temperature and critical exponents for a single band and for two bands . for the single band case ,<n> the results are very similar to those of bcs theory , while for the two band case we find that the interband interaction has a strong effect on the behaviour of the dominant band , but has only a weak effect on that of the other band . <n> the two - dimensional hubbard hamiltonian @xmath0 has been studied extensively , particularly in relation to high temperature superconductivity @xcite . in this model<n> , there are two energy bands , each with its own critical temperature , which are connected by a pair of energy gaps . at low temperatures , the two energy gaps are independent , and so the system is expected to exhibit critical behaviour in a metallic state . however , in recent years it has been realized that there is a more complex situation , where there is also an interaction between the two bands in addition to the usual hubbard interaction . as a result , it is now well known that the two we study the effect of an interband coupling on the critical temperature of a two band hubbard model .<n> we use a combination of exact diagonalization , perturbation theory and a finite summation approach , and show that the coupling has a very weak effect on the behaviour of the order parameters of the two bands , but has a strong effect on their critical temperature . in particular , we find that there is a hidden criticality , which is present only in the weak coupling limit . <n> 2 the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a strong magnetic field is characterized by the presence of a large number of gapless bands . at low temperatures ,<n> the band structure is determined by the hund s rule coupling , @xmath0 , between the electron orbitals , while at higher temperatures the system is well described by a single band model , in which the electron and hole bands are decoupled by a small coupling constant , _<n> i.e. _ the hubbard @xcite interaction . as the temperature is lowered , the system undergoes a series of phase transitions , first to a metallic state at low temperature , then to an insulating state at high we study the effect of an interband coupling @xmath0 on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( gl ) series for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in the presence of a magnetic field .<n> we find that the gl series does not converge to the exact solution in the limit that the coupling goes to zero , and that the expansion converges slowly or diverges in the region where the coupling is small , but converges very slowly in the opposite limit . <n> we also find that there is a pivot point above which the magnitude of the gl terms decrease , while below this point the magnitudes of the terms remain approximately constant . at this point ,<n> the gl solutions of the dominant bands are affected , with the gl solution of the smaller band showing non - convergent behaviour , even though the gl convergence for any small non - zero coupling is very slow or convergent . in the case of strong interband interaction , we find a critical value of the coupling which separates two degenerate ground states , one of which is unstable with respect to the formation of a topological superconductor , from the other which is stable . the land we investigate the effect of interband interactions on the critical behaviour of the two - band hubbard model .<n> we use a combination of bogoliubov - degennes ( bcs ) and girsanov - larkin - ovchinnikov ( gl ) approximations , as well as a variational approach , to obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature and fermi surfacehendieck expansion coefficients . in the bcs limit<n> , we find that the dominant band is unperturbed by the interband interaction , while the second band quickly becomes indistinguishable from the first band . with the gl approximation ,<n> we show that there is a large range of validity of the theory . <n> pacs numbers : 71.27.+a , 71.30.+h , 75.10.pq 2 the hubbard @xmath0 model is one of the simplest examples of a strongly correlated electron system , and has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . despite its simplicity , the model has a number of interesting properties , such as non -

landau ( gl ) theory has to be carefully examined considering its domain of applicability . here<n> we examine the validity of the gl theory in the case of multiband superconductors .<n> we find that the gl solution to the energy gaps below the critical temperature @xmath0 is unreliable , and therefore care must be taken when applying the gl model . when the interband coupling is larger or when one of the gaps is very dominant , the gl solutions performs much better and including higher order terms can make the solution close to the bcs value over a large temperature range . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the seminal works of john clem , vladimir kogan , francois peeters andnguyen van hieu @xcite , gl theory has been an important tool in the study of superconductivity . in recent years<n> it has been applied to a wide range of materials including cuprates , heavy fermions , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) , unconventional superconductor ( essc ) and pnictides , to name a few . since the late we review the generalization of the abrikosov -

flow chart for all the considered benchmark points and the invariant mass distributions of bb pairs . we propose to search for a higgs boson with a mass below the @xmath0 mass scale , in the decay mode of a top quark pair .<n> we show that such a signal can be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with an integrated luminosity of at least 100 pb@xmath1 . <n> = by -1 the discovery of new particles at the lhc will have important consequences for our understanding of physics beyond the standard model . among the many possibilities ,<n> one of the most promising is the existence of a new state of matter @xcite , the higgs sector of the new physics . in this scenario<n> , it is expected that the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , and the new gauge boson is a partner of the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) state of the hot and dense medium created in the early stages of the heavy - ion collisions , known as the qcd phase transition ( htc ) @x<n> . if the htc takes place , one may also expect to observe many new effects , such as anomalous couplings of quarks and gluons to the hadrons , in the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson is the most massive particle . in extensions of the sm<n> , it may also be a partner of the @xmath0 boson .<n> if it is a partner , then it may mix with the sm quarks and bosons of the first two generations , leading to flavor changing neutral interactions ( fcni ) with z and h bosons . <n> we consider a particular case of a heavy neutral fermion ( 5b+x ) that mixes only with the top quark , and study the decay of this heavy quark to a pair of light neutral bosons ( 6b s and 2w s ) at the lhc , at the center of mass energy , @xcite . we find that in the mass range from 500 gev to 1 tev , a signal of the order of few fb can be observed , in comparison to the sm background , for an integrated luminosity of at least 30 fb@xmath1 , provided that the mixing angle of the 5b is greater than 120 gev and the mass of the light neutral quark is in the range of 120 ge we consider the decays of the higgs boson @xmath0 , produced in association with a bottom - antibottom pair , to the final states : @xmath1  , mathbbr, left(frac1v_rm higgs+sqrt2right)$ ] .<n> we compute the total cross section for the process , including the leading decay amplitudes , the branching ratios and the total forward - backward asymmetries ( fba ) . we find that in the mass range between 350 gev and 500 gev , an integrated luminosity of 30 fb should be sufficient to either ( i ) discover or ( ii ) rule out the existence of this higgs . <n> the discovery of a new boson , if it exists , will have profound consequences for our understanding of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm )<n> , this new state , called a higgs @xcite , plays a crucial role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ews we propose a new method to measure the cp violation parameter @xmath0 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is based on the measurement of the cp asymmetry in the decays of the top and bottom squarks .<n> we show that the cp asymmetries can be determined with good accuracy . <n> the top squark decays @xcite have been of great interest because of their possible links to supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking . in susy breaking scenarios ,<n> the susy partners of the quarks and the anti - quarks are the so - called higgs and gauginos , respectively , whose masses and couplings to the higgs particles are fixed by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the gauge bosons . as a consequence , it is expected that the top quark decays into a pair of higgses , and the corresponding susy particles can be measured precisely . however , up to now , there is no direct way to extract the cp violating parameter of the sussy model from the top decays , due to the lack of precise vev information . on the other recent lattice qcd calculations of the cross sections for the production of @xmath0 mesons at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are presented .<n> the results are compared with recent measurements of the inclusive cross sections , and the extraction of the charm quark mass is discussed . <n> recent lattice simulations of heavy quarkonium production at the lhc @xcite have revealed a number of interesting phenomena . among these<n> are the observation of a large production cross section for the cp - odd pseudoscalar meson and the suppression of the ratio of charm to bottom quark decays , both of which have not been observed before in hadron - hadron collisions . in this letter<n> , we show that these phenomena can be explained in the framework of the pereslstein - petriello ( ps ) and zhang - zheng ( zheng ) models of strong interactions , where the ps and zheng couplings are determined by the pion - pion coupling , respectively . as a result ,<n> the values of the production cross sections are found to be in excellent agreement with the recent experimental data of peresrstein and petriello we propose a new method to extract the @xmath0 quark mass from the ratio of the decay constants of the charmonium and bottomonia states .<n> the method is based on the assumption that the decay amplitudes of these two states are of the same order of magnitude . in this case<n> it is possible to extract both the mass and the width of each of the two states , provided that they have the same decay constant . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of the bottomonia . <n> the study of charmonium decays has been one of the main topics of the present generation of high energy colliders . at present<n> there is a great deal of interest in the possibility of determining the charmium mass from two different observables : the decay width @xcite and the decay angle @x<n> . there are two main approaches in this problem . the first approach is to use the decay rates of the states as functions of the center - of - mass energy , which is a function of the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions . for charmonium ,<n> this is done in the framework of qcd sum rules , while for bottomonia it is done the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start running in 2012 with an initial luminosity of @xmath0 pb@xmath1 .<n> this corresponds to an energy upgrade by a factor of three over the previous lhc program , which ended in 2005 . in this report<n> we present the expected luminosity for the first two years of lhc running . <n> the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite opens a new era in particle physics and cosmology . at present<n> , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of a new state of matter , dubbed the electroweak gauge boson ( ewfb ) , predicted by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) to be the main ingredient of the new physics beyond the sm . among the many possibilities to explain the mass of the ewbf , one of the simplest and most promising is the mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , mediated by the exchange of a fermion - antifermion pair of color - triplet scalar bosons , so - called susy triplets ( sdss ) @x the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , currently under construction in geneva , switzerland , will explore the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at the unprecedented center of mass energy of 7 tev .<n> one of the most exciting features of the lhc is the possibility to search for new physics , which could be associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking . in particular , the search for the higgs boson , predicted in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp)@xcite , could provide a window to new physics scenarios beyond the sm . among the most promising scenarios are supersymmetry ( susy ) with extra dimensions and extra chiral particles , such as squarks and sleptons , as well as supersymmetric partners of the quarks and gluons . <n> if susy is realized in nature , it is very likely that the sm is supersymmetric ( s ) and that the lightest neutralino ( nl ) is the only sm particle that has not yet been discovered . at the tevatron ,<n> the lhcb experiment we present the first measurement of @xmath0 , the ratio of transverse momenta of the two jets produced in the decay , based on a large data sample collected at the lhc .<n> the measurement is performed in the framework of parton cascade model , where partons from the initial hard parton showers are rescattered off the initial partons in the final hadrons , leading to the production of a jet of one of the jets followed by the other jet of the same jet . <n> the study of the properties of the qcd parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) is an important tool to test the validity of the standard model ( sm ) and to search for physics beyond it . in particular<n> , it is important to measure the parton distributions in the lepton sector , since this is where sm predictions are expected to be tested the most in the near future at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite . at the present lhc energy ,<n> the transverse momentum distribution of lepton pairs has been measured with high precision @xcite and a variety of theoretical models have been proposed to explain the data . among these , phenomenological models based on the pythia6 monte - carlo event generator is now available for download at http://www.hepforge.org/downloads/pythia6[http://www-hep.phys.soton.ac.uk/belyaev / comphep / calchep - pyth ] .<n> this event generator includes the latest cms @xmath0 data , including the cms forward - backward asymmetry @xcite , cms charged - particle spectra , and the first data from the lhc , as well as other recent results from the atlas and cms collaborations . <n> pythia is the most widely used event generator used in high energy physics ( hep ) experiments , used to calculate event generators for pion and kaon production in proton - proton collisions , lepton - nucleon collisions and heavy - ion collisions at energies up to a few tev . in this high energy regime ,<n> hep events are dominated by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations , which are computationally expensive to implement in pythia . as a result , hep event generators have become an essential tool for hep experiments",

quark loop contributions . in order to single out a contribution , a link - variable transformation is required ; a polykov loop is rotated as a link variable after a transformation , which also affects dynamical ( wraparound ) loops . by means of such a uniform transformation<n> , the contribution can be singled out . <n> quark dynamics is one of the most important ingredients in understanding the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ; see @xcite for a review . for a qgp with dynamical quarks ,<n> the finiteness of quark density at finite chemical potential is a central issue , since the qgp is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons . to understand such a finiteness , it is essential to understand the contribution from polyakov loops , i.e. we show that a polyakov loop @xmath0 can be rotated by a link - variable transformation such that its response to a fundamental charge is the same as that obtained in a quenched system .<n> however , we also show that in the vacuum , there exists another link variable transformation , and this is different from the quark -

loop variable by means of such link variable transformations . denoting the charge conjugation symmetry ,  @x we investigate the effect of dynamical quarks on the confining property of the qcd vacuum .<n> we show that the vacuum still contains quark loops , and if the quark chemical potential is finite , there will exist @xmath0 net quarks in the system , which are responsible for the string -

mills theories with a nonminimal coupling constant .<n> we show that polyakov loops in the confining background are rather uniformly distributed around the origin , which enables us to clarify the nature of the confining vacuum . <n> it is well - known that the confining properties of qcd can be understood in terms of the symmetries of the theory . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is realized in the strong coupling regime , where the quarks and gluons in the plasma are deconfined and behave as if they are in a classical vacuum @xcite . on the other hand , in qcd<n> , there is a confining phase transition between the qgp and a chirally symmetric qcd phase , called the qcd - qcd transition , at a critical temperature @x . at a finite temperature , the vacuum energy density and the vacuum expectation value ( vev )<n> are strongly suppressed , and hence one can not directly observe the transition from the sm to the qg . we evaluate the polyakov loop in the @xmath0 gauge theory with two flavors of dynamical fermions at finite chemical potentials .<n> we focus on the phase angles of the fermionic and polyakov loops , and find that the phase angle of the full determinant grows rapidly as we increase the chemical potential , which is caused by the asymmetry between quarks and anti - quarks . on the other hand ,<n> the phaseangle of the partial determinant remains zero in the small-@xmath1 region and rapidly grows above some value of chemical potential when the number of wraparound quarks in the determinant is large . in order to show the difference , we perform a test with a non - vanishing quark chemical potential and find a good agreement . <n> dynamical fermi systems have been studied intensively in the past few years , due to the possibility of observing the large fluctuations of various observables in the quenched approximation @xcite , as well as the possible role of fermion condensation in the deconfinement phase transition of qcd . to study the response of dynamical systems to quenched perturbations , one usually tries to use a gauge in which the gauge fields are static , so that we investigate the order of fermionic charges in qcd with two flavors of dynamical quarks .<n> we find that @xmath0 , and hence the order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking , is not likely to exist in the physical vacuum , which is a candidate for an order parameter in the chiral limit . on the other hand ,<n> the polyakov - loop order parameter is likely to be a candidate in the unquenched limit , as well . <n> [ [ section ] ] in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , there are two chiral order parameters , the quark and the anti - quark mass . in the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) phase of the sm @xcite , these two order parameters are related to each other through the symmetries of the theory . at the same time , in the qcd phase transition ( tpt ) , it is generally believed that there is no chiral order parameter , since there are three net quarks in the system . however , this is not the case in the deconfined phase of qcd , where there are @x we study the @xmath0-@xmath1 color confinement in unquenched qcd updation processes .<n> we find that the distribution of the ratio of statistical weights of the ordinary updations to those of the unquelched ones is qualitatively similar to that of the polyakov -

dirac matrix , in finite volume quenched and deconfined qcd . in the latter case ,<n> we find that the observables are much more sensitive to fermion degrees of freedom than those in the quenched case .<n> we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these observables for the detection of the qcd phase transition . <n> it has been a long - standing problem in the study of the phase diagram of qcd ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) how the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is divided into two phases : a low - temperature phase and a high - temperature one . at the same time , it is well - known that the qgp undergoes a phase transition between the two phases at some critical temperature @x<n> . however , the nature of the transition is still an open question : is it a crossover , or a first - order transition ? in this paper , we study these two questions in finite - volume backgrounds , which are known to be non - we study the gauge invariant quark - antiquark ( @xmath0 ) bound states in the non - abelian higgs model in the canonical formulation .<n> we find that the transition from the confinement phase to the deconfined phase is reflected in the form of a crossover in the transition function , which is calculated in the mean - field approximation . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 14.40.cs in the past few years , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the phase diagram of the higgs theory . in particular , it has been realized that the standard model ( sm ) has two phases , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the hadron - hadron ( hhg ) phase , where the qgp is realized in the high energy limit whereas the hhg is realized at the low energy limit . on the other hand , in order to understand the mechanism of qcd transition , various approaches have been proposed . among them<n> , a gauge - invariant formulation of the sm has been proposed in refs . @xcite we investigate the order parameters of qcd vacuum , focusing on the fluctuations of a polyakov loop ( @xmath0 ) and fermionic determinants ( @ xmath1 ) .<n> we consider a prescription that is free from the direct charge - screening effects by quark loops and clarify the confining nature of a vacuum . we study the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar meson , @xmath0 , using a nonperturbative method based on the chiral quark - hadron duality . we find that the mass is consistent with the experimental value within the error bounds .<n> we also study the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , and find that it does not change the mass significantly . <n> it has been a long - standing problem whether or not the chiral symmetry of the qcd vacuum is broken . in the early days of qcd @xcite , it was pointed out that there is a problem in the definition of the quark mass in the standard model ( sm ) , which is called the mass gap . since then , various approaches have been proposed to solve this problem , among which the simplest one is to consider the vacuum as a chirally symmetric configuration in which the masses of the light quarks and antiquarks are the same as those of the strange quarks . however , the solution of the massgap problem has not been universally accepted . on the other hand ,<n> it is well - known that the chirally - symmetric vacuum has a mass gap of about 0.5 gev  we propose a new mechanism for the production of @xmath0 in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .<n> it is based on the interaction of a hard particle with a deconfined quark -

body model that accounts for themicrosphere inertia . we compare the estimated adhesive force with estimations based on measurements of the out - of - plane contact resonance of the micro spheres obtained using optical indeferometry and find that the latter underestimates the adhesive force .<n> scanning electron microscope images of the delaminated monolayer areas reveal a unique morphology wherein the monolayer has fractured into flakes that have partially reattached to the substrate and are composed of mostly single crystalline domains . spallation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in physics , chemistry , biology , and material science .<n> it has been used to treat a wide variety of problems , including crystallization , phase transitions , surface tension , mechanical contact , etc . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in using spallative materials in a variety of applications , such as ultra - sensitive force sensors , ultra - flexible endoscopes , optomechanical systems , ... to name a few @xcite . however , until recently , it has not been possible to measure spalling forces directly on single crystalline materials . here ,<n> we report for the first time optical inteferometry of a monolayer of polystyrene microspheres on a single - crystal substrate , as well as measurements of the force exerted on the monolayer by acoustic waves in the substrate . using a femtosecond laser , we are able to excite acoustic waves on the microsphere - coated substrate and measure surface accelerations and surface displacements of the sample surface , which we compare to theoretical predictions . <n> the use of ultra - thin crystalline materials on a substrate is often associated with a variety we use ultrafast laser pulses to induce spallation in a glass of aluminum .<n> the laser pulses excite new monolayers in the aluminum layer , and we monitor the new positions after each pump pulse . by comparing measured surface displacements to those calculated from a simple model that accounts for the microspheres inertia , we determine the force acting on the aluminum monolayer . in the experiments ,<n> we find that the substrate is accelerated by the excitation ablates the energy - absorbing aluminum layer and that the acceleration is proportional to the square root of the pump pulse duration . <n> laser - induced spallations are the manifestation of strong nonlinear interactions between light and matter @xcite . at the highest pump intensities , where the nonlinearity is the strongest , the interaction is between a particle and a particle - substrate contact , which is known as spalling . since such nonlinear interactions are ubiquitous , it is natural to ask whether they can be observed in other nonlinear media , such as ultrafast lasers . here<n> we show that laser pulses can be used to excite spalled particles and substrates in a variety of nonlinear media ( nonlinear acoustics , sound , gravity , ... )  we report on the first observation of microsphere detachment from an optical substrate using a cw , short pulse laser with a peak energy of @xmath0n .<n> the microspheres were suspended in the substrate during the laser pulse , and the laser was tuned so that the particle - substrate contact resonance occurred at the lowest pump energy where we observed microsphere removal . at this pump energy<n> , we observed a tensile force applied to the contact of about 10@xmath1 n , corresponding to a microsphere tensile force of about @xcite , or an adhesive force , averaged between 1@xcite and 3@x , of about 1@n , for a single microsphere . <n> laser - driven particle removal is an important tool in many fields of science and technology , such as biomedical imaging , material science , laser - plasma interactions , optical coherence tomography , etc . for instance , the removal of nanometer - sized particles such as carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , which are used as building blocks in biomedical imaging systems , has been demonstrated to be particularly effective at removing particles with sizes down to a few nanometers . in this case , spallation is an important tool in the manipulation and separation of colloidal particles .<n> it has been used to control the motion of individual particles , as well as the shape and size of clusters , in biological systems @xcite , colloidal particles in solids , and mesoscopic particles in the mems . here<n> , we use a femtosecond laser to induce the nucleation of microspheres in a monolayer of gold nanoparticles @xmath0m@xmath1 , which are then spalled by the same laser field as the monolayer . by varying the pump energy , the amount of monolayerdelamination and the degree of re - adhesion to the sample surface ,<n> we are able to track the evolution of the colloidal particle population during the particle removal process . in previous experiments with continuous , ductile thin films , it was found that some particles remain adherent to the surface near the onset of particle removal , while detached monolayer flakes resettle on the sample s surface . we find that almost all of the delaminated flakes are composed of single hcp crystalline domains , suggesting that fracture of the mono layer into flakes is the result of interparticle deco we use laser - induced spallation to induce the formation of crystalline domains in a continuous , ductile , ultrathin film . using a combination of measurements and theory ,<n> we show that the film s mechanical properties depend strongly on the degree of adhesion of microspheres to the film surface .<n> we find that when the film is adhesive , the microsphere detachment force is smaller than the adhesion force measured from the out - of - plane microsphere contact resonance on a different region of the same sample , indicating that the region with the stronger adhesion is the one that forms the delaminated flakes . <n> thin films of ultrathin metallic or semiconducting materials exhibit a range of mechanical properties , including mechanical strength , electrical conductivity , and thermal stability @xcite . in many applications , however , it is important to control the properties of the material at or near its surface , where interactions between particles and surfaces can lead to a variety of phenomena , such as mechanical , electronic , or chemical instabilities . for example , in applications where the surface is not a perfect substrate , colloidal suspensions , granular materials , spalled thin films , as well as we report on the interferometric measurement of the adhesive force between a microsphere and a rigid substrate .<n> the adhesion is measured using an acoustic interferometer , wherein a probe beam focused on the microspheres and a reference beam is focused on a stationary region of the sample . by focusing the probe beam to a diameter of @xmath0 m ( at 1/e2 intensity level ) ,<n> the effective adhesive force is measured as a function of the radius of curvature of the contact , and is shown to exhibit a pronounced maximum at a contact stiffness corresponding to the sphere radius . using a hertzian contact model , we relate the resonant frequency to the contact stiffness by assuming the spheres act as a spring mass oscillator with a resonant frequency that is determined by the contact elasticity and adhesive force . <n> adhesive forces between thin films of elastic materials are ubiquitous in the fields of adhesive processing , adhesion prediction , material science , biomedical imaging , soft robotics , etc . in recent years<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the use of adhesive forces to control material properties such as mechanical strength @xcite , viscosities , elastic moduli , stiffness , this work reports data regarding the adhesion , contact mechanics , and delamination of microsphere monolayers . by observing ps microspheres adhered to substrates via sem ,<n> we find an adhesive force of @xmath0n , an adhesive work of adhesion of _ s_@xmath1 j / m2(j , m)1$ ] , where s = aluminum , r is the effective radius of curvature of the contact ( equal to the microsphere radius for spherical -

mull we present a laser - induced spallation study of a microscale analog of a macroscale granular crystal . by applying a transverse electric field perpendicular to the plane of the substrate ,<n> we generate a pulsed laser with frequency @xmath0 mhz , which induces spallations in ps microspheres adhered to a substrate via sem .<n> we find that the energy level of the spallative pulses is proportional to the adhesion of the microparticles , and that the laser frequency does not have to be tuned to excite a specific mode . in the presence of adhesive forces , we observe a decrease in the energy of spalled ps monolayers with decreasing laser frequency , in agreement with the predictions of the dmt contact model and the work of adhesion obtained in this study . from the analysis of the energy levels of the laser - generated spallated pulses we obtain a work of adhesive force @xcite , a contact radius of fwhm@xmath1 m , an adhesion coefficient of s / m@xcite = 0.36 , as well as a fracture velocity of @ xmath2 m / s . the unique monolayer flakes studied in this work may find microsphere monolayers ( mwms ) can be used to trap and actuate matter at the interface between two media , for example , liquid water and air .<n> however , it is not known how to assemble these structures directly into a monolayer that is small enough to be incorporated into a larger fluid container . here<n> , we report the first experimental demonstration of a mwmo monolayer , consisting of a micron - sized ( @xmath0 ) , close - packed microsphere ( smm ) that is assembled directly into an air - water interface monolayer by means of a phase - mask interferometer . using surface acoustic waves ,<n> we show that the assembly of the monolayer can be controlled by the amplitude and phase of the surface acoustic wave field . as a result , the s mm monolayer is found to be close to a maximally - packed monolayer when the amplitude of the field exceeds a critical value , which depends on the particle size and the interfacial pressure gradient . <n> the combination of microspheres and liquid water has been used to form a wide variety of structures @xcite . in particular , these materials can we report on the development of a phase - mask based interferometer for thermoelastic measurements .<n> the concept is based on the use of a laser - induced forward transfer process in the deposition of a thin film on a substrate . in this way<n> , a phase mask can be created in the film , which is then used to perform a thermoelastic measurement of the deposited material . as an example application , we demonstrate the performance of this device for the measurement of thermal conductivity . <n> thin film deposition ( tld ) is a well - established technique for a wide range of applications in science and technology , such as atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite , atomic force spectroscopy ( afs ) , thermal imaging , material and atomic - scale mechanical and optical properties . at the same time , it has been shown to be extremely inefficient for measurements of thermoelastic phenomena such as thermal conductivity ( tc ) and electron - phonon ( e - p ) scattering , as well as for other applications such as thermoelastic spectroscopy ( tis ) ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein )<n> . however ,",

dimensional persistence random walk ( prw ) , which deviates from a normal rw by the fact that the probability , @xmath0 , that it jumps in the same direction as in previous step , is higher than the previous one . the other time process is simply generated from the first one in this paper , we present an algorithm for finding the time of maximum correlation in time series .<n> the algorithm is based on artificial time series where the jumps in the time series do not occur at the same time . in order to have the same problem as with the original data sets that the jumps do not happen at the the same times in the different time series<n> , it is found that increasing the time difference , @xmath0 , helps identifying the time in which the maximum correlation is maximum . the time dependent cross correlation of the returns contains a product of the _ return _ of company a with that of company b shifted by @xcite . <n> the solution to the problem is simply that one shifts the starting point of the return of the company b by the change in time difference<n> . + + pacs numbers : 05.45.tp , 89.65.gh , 89.90.+n + + * keywords : * artificial intelligence , time series analysis , maximum correlation , cross correlation . we study the correlation of returns of companies in the dow jones industrial average .<n> the correlation is found to be non -

locking in the early 1980s the first evidence of a systematic blueshift of the broad - line profile with respect to low - ionization lines ( lils ) was presented .<n> since then evidence has considerably strengthened with several papers appearing in the 1990s confirming the previous result . in this paper<n> i review the main developments of the last two decades . <n> low-@xmath0 broad emission lines ( bal qsos , @xmath1 ) were found to be systematically blueshifted , but not in all cases @xcite . the most extreme case being the systematic blue shift of the nlsy1 source i zw 1 , which is an example of an extreme case , albeit extreme , that has been intensively studied in the literature . for high- ionization lines , hils ( quasar - like ) , it is possible to compare low- and high ionization lines for many tens of low- , intermediate , and high - ionization sources . only in a very small number of cases<n> is the line blueshift confirmed with a high statistical significance , in most of the cases as well as in a few extreme cases . from a theoretical point of view the broad - line region ( vblr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is often associated with virial motion of the central black hole .<n> however , as one moves along the emission - line sequence in pop . <n> a , the dynamics of the blr becomes increasingly complex , and wind emission is no longer dominant . here<n> i review some of the recent developments in this field . micro - lensing of the broad - line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has revealed the existence of a third region in pop . a : a very - broad line region , or vblr , that accounts for the innermost emission and for the prominent redward asymmetries observed in the line profile of these sources .<n> this said , one should be aware that the v blr can not be rigorously isolated in the profile , and that there , if virial motions account for the bulk line broadening , a smooth gradient of ionization with distance from the central continuum source . empirically , the most prominent lines can be modeled by the addition of three components , each of them associated to the regions described above . in spectral type b1@xmath0 it is irrelevant and undetectable almost so in bin b1 @xmath1 . only in spectral types b1 , b2 and b3 it is relevant or undetectable . it appears reasonable that the presence of axial , powerful relativistic outflows may hinder the propagation of the line - emitting gas . <n> the optical emission is not emitted in the broadest component associated to a vblrs  narrow line quasars ( nlsy1s ) represent a special class of radio - quiet sources since they are the ones with the largest fraction of rl frii galaxies .<n> they are also among the sources with the highest systematic blueshifts . in this paper<n> , we investigate the physical properties of the narrow line region ( nlr ) and its relation with the radio properties . <n> the nlr is an important region in the life of agns since it is where relativistic outflows are expected to form and where they can be detected and probed . since the first generation of radio telescopes , most of the effort has been devoted to the study of the structure of the radio - emitting region ( rnr ) , the largest known volume of the universe , at cosmological distances . however , recent progress in the understanding of the dynamics of the rnrs has led to the discovery of a number of remarkable properties of this volume . among these properties<n> are : 1 ) the presence of a disk wind , which can be easily associated to fast outflowing gas ; 2 ) a relativistic outflow , with a mass outflow rate of @xmath0 we present the results of a systematic search for blue outliers in the @xmath0 , ( ) @xcite e1 diagram .<n> we find that the fraction of sources showing blue shifts is extremely low , only a few percent of the total number of sources in the e1 plane . <n> the blueshifts seem to constrain the blr / nlr structure . in both blr and nlr<n> we observe hil blue shifts , while lil appear to be more symmetric . at low @ ,<n> both and appear to arise in a radial flow constrained in a cone of large half - opening angle , where the receding part of the flow is obscured by an optically thick accretion disk . a model of gas moving following a wind velocity field ( [ wind ] ) consistently explained the observed profiles of both and , both and as emitted at different distances within the same flow . both and<n> were assumed to arise as emitted in an outflow , within a compact nlr . here<n> we present a simple model that can reproduce the observed blueshift and the profile of both lines , as the result of an outflow within a very compact ( 1 pc for a black hole mass of 10@ the blr , nlr and lil are observed to follow different evolutionary sequences : extreme pop . a sources radiating a large eddington ratio , wind dominated , to the  dying '' pop. b sources that host very massive black hole , radiate at low eddington ratios and show very extended nlr .<n> the nlr prominence may serve as quantitative evolutionary parameters . we review some of our current understanding of radiation acceleration in outflows and winds from quasars . <n> radiative acceleration has long been recognized as an important component of the phenomenology of outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .<n> recent years have seen an explosion of observational and theoretical activity aimed at understanding the physics of the acceleration process @xcite . in this short contribution<n> we will focus on some of the recent advances in the field , with particular emphasis on the following questions : ( 1 ) what is happening at the base of the outflow / wind ?<n> ( 2 ) how are the outflows evolving ? ( 3 )<n> what is the nature of the flow ? broad emission line profiles in low - eddington ratio quasars are consistent with the coexistence of a gravitationally bound region and a radiatively driven outflow @xcite .<n> the blueshifted component is prominent in , and is revealed in a consistent fit of blended profiles . <n> the broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be divided into two broad classes : ( i ) the narrow - line region ( lil - blr ) , which is associated with the accretion disk and contains @xmath0@xmath1 of gas , ( ii ) their broad - line regions ( blrs ) which are associated with low - luminosity sources ( pop . a ) and are characterized by a broad component of emission with a redshift distribution that deviates from a pure power - law : the typical deviation from a power law is larger at lower luminosities , where the redshifts are larger ; and ( iii ) broad - emission line ( bel ) regions , in which the blr gas is infalling toward the central black hole and the broad lines are emitted out to large distances . in pop<n> . b<n> sources broad - line quasars ( bal qsos ) are among the most peculiar sources in pop .<n> a ) they are characterized by very high ionization parameter ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 ) ; b ) bals are extreme ( bals radiate at high ) and c ) there is a surprisingly weak blueshifted component in the low - ionization ( lil ) resonance doublet , mgii , recently discovered in pg 1700 + 512 @xcite . here we review the physical conditions in the outflowing gas emitting the broad lines , the dynamical status of the line - emitting gas , and the implications for the qso phenomenology . [ [ section ] ] the  coexistence '' of a gravitationally bound region and a radiatively driven outflow is readily explained as follows . <n> 1 . a source disperses a highly enriched gas . in extreme pop. a sources<n> is driven by line and ionizing photon pressure and can accelerate a line - driving wind to high ionized parameter . the eddington ratio is not high in order to launch a wind , provided that the ionization parameter is low . 2 . blueshifts of up to @xmath0 in the and resonance doublet have been discovered recently in hils .<n> the shift is large , and implies that the line emitting gas is predominantly in outflow . in the framework of photoionization<n> the partially - ionized zone extends to much larger depth within a gas cloud or slab than the fully - ionicized zone where is emitted . such high gas has to exist if photoionizing is at work : we are speaking of a very prominent line in all type 1 quasar spectra . <n> the discovery of broad absorption line ( bal ) systems ( bals ) in the early 1990 s @xcite has been one of the most significant advances in the field of quazar spectroscopy . since bals are observed in sources of relatively low eddington ratio ( suggesting that line driving is important ) they are expected to be a powerful diagnostic tool for the nature of the broad emission line region ( belr ) . however , only a few years ago it was thought that bals were rare in vlbi observations : now we know that they are common in the radio band , they are also detected in x - ray and inter - line shift analysis has proved a powerful tool to understand this aspect of quasar structure and kinematics . in bins of fwhm , @xmath0 , the blueshift is associated with a wind component whose prominence increases with along the 4de1 sequence .<n> we present results from a study of the and blueshifts in a large sample of low - redshift ( pop . <n> a ) type 1 , blr and nlr , using data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . the relative number of objects in bins ( which are a minority of the sample ) is typically around 10% @xcite . for bins a2 , a3 and a4 ,<n> the fraction of objects with a blueshift increases from 10% in bins a1 to 20% in a3 , and from 10% to 25% in a4 as the luminosity decreases . within the nlr<n> there is no clear trend with luminosity : the fraction increases from a3 to a4 and then decreases from a4 to a3 again . at low luminosities<n> is consistent with emission originating in outflowing gas , at least in part  inter - line shift analysis has proved a powerful tool to understand the structure of quasars within the blr and nlr . here<n> i review the basic properties of the wind component and its relation to the other outflow components .<n> recent developments point toward the possibility of resonant line driving as an explanation for outflows at low . narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are quasars with broad emission lines , redshifted by several hundred km s@xmath0 , and characterized by a narrow emission - line spectrum ( @xmath1 ev ) .<n> they are characterized by high intrinsic luminosities , large rest - frame equivalent widths , high velocity dispersions , a wide range of metallicities and , in some cases , very red colors . in this paper<n> , we present the results of a spectroscopic study of a sample of 11 nl1s observed with the very large telescope ( vlt ) in the optical and near - infrared wavebands . <n> nl 1s are excellent laboratories for the study of the broad - line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) since their intrinsic properties can be studied in great detail and their broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be well modeled by a single component , the blr photon index , which can be measured to high accuracy . from the analysis of their optical and nir spectra ,<n> we show that ,",

dimensional ( 2d ) materials<n> , it is well known that the curie - weiss temperature @xmath0 , which is the temperature at which the magnetization drops to zero , depends on the dimensionality of the material , the fermi energy , and the magnetic anisotropy of the sample . on the other hand , for three - dimensional materials<n> the curi - weierstrass ( cw ) temperature is known to be a non - monotonic function of dimensionality , with the maximum for the smallest dimension . as a result , in the low-@xmath1 limit , cw materials are easy to study experimentally and theoretically , since it is well known , that for flat samples , there appears a vortex state , providing the absence of volume and edge surface magnetostatic charges . in particular , for the disk shape particle , it is the static vortex configuration . here<n> we show that the vortex state can also be realized for the particle shape having the shape of cylinder with spherically deformed face surfaces .<n> the reason for the uniform easy axes state is dictated by geometry : the sample is elongated along z axis , having the form of cylinder having the deformed face surface . for small enough aspect ratios , @xmath0 , the uniform state is favoured . <n> the state of magnetization can be described as follows : [ eq : magnetization -

based quantum computation ( pqc ) , quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite and particle based metrology ( ptmt ) in the last two decades . among them , magnetic nanoparticles play an important role , not only because of its fundamental importance , but also due to its potential use in the field of quantum computing . for the last decade<n> they have been widely studied in the condensed matter physics , where they can be used as non - magnetic elements in the system of magnetic resonators , or as elementary magnetic particles . the main advantage of the magnetic nanoparticles is their size , since the size of a single particle can be reduced by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the spherical particle . also we study the magnetization configuration in a magnetic cap , which consists of two concentric hemispheres .<n> we show that such a geometry can be realized for the easy plane and the easy surface models . using the vortex ansatz ,<n> we derive an effective action for the magnetic state . in the limit of large system size<n> we find that the vortex state shell has the same structure as in the plane model , forming an edge soliton ( boojum ) . for smaller system<n> size the vortex shell is shifted to higher remanence configuration , corresponding to the onion state configuration . <n> magnetization configurations in magnetic caps are of great current interest , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . here , we focus on the vortex states , i.e. , the configurations of magnetization in which the sense of circulation is opposite to that in which it is positive . these states are realized in various geometries , see e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein . among them<n> there is the ring geometry , where the onion states are well known , as well as the spherical shells , also known as the so - called  onion states ''  we describe a new type of states , the so - called _ onion states _ , for the spherical shells and hemispherical caps .<n> they are characterized by the _ asymmetries _ in the distribution of the magnetization , which are related to the hemispherical symmetry and to the symmetry of the surface anisotropy . <n> _ introduction : _ recently we observed a number of new types of states in various systems . among them<n> there are the states of vortices , of shells , and of onion states @xcite . in all these states<n> the magnetostatic energy of the spherical surfaces produces neither volume charges nor surface charges on the ring surface , while in the onion state it produces neither surface charges nor volume charges , so it is called an onion state . for the vortex state<n> it was sufficient to limit ourselves by such an approach since the vortex magnetization distribution does not produce neither volume charge nor surface charge on the rings , it is a state , known for the ring geometry . here<n> we describe the onion states in hemispherical cap geometry , where the sense of circulation in the caps is opposite to that in the ring , forming we study the effect of surface anisotropy on the vortex state in ferromagnetic rings .<n> we show that the ground state of the vortex system in a ring with a small aspect ratio is an onion state , where the magnetostatic energy of the ring itself plays the role of the onion charge . in the case of a large aspect ratio<n> the onion state is always unstable with respect to the homogeneous vortex state . <n> vortices are the most common states of magnetic systems @xcite . they are characterized by the presence of vortex - antivortex pairs , or vortex - vortex pairs separated by a small gap , and by the appearance of surface charges on the ring surface , see , e.g. , refs . and references therein . as a result<n> , they are also known as the vortex and the ring state ; @xmath0 here ,  ring '' stands for surface ; and  surface charge '' is defined as the charge of a ring s surface which is parallel to the direction of magnetization ; see fig . [ s : ring - vortex ] . for a homogeneous vortex ,<n> the surface charge is equal to we present a theoretical study of the equilibrium magnetization distribution in thin hemispherical shells .<n> it is shown that the ground state of the very thin shell is the monodomain ( onion ) state . by increasing the shell thickness<n> one can switch to the vortex state , described by , which is stable over a wide range of sample sizes . in the upper region of the shell the onion state is realized , in the lower region the vortex states appear . <n> magnetization is one of the most important properties in condensed matter physics . as a result<n> , there is a huge amount of theoretical and experimental works on magnetization properties of different materials , e.g. , cuprates , iron pnictides , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) @xcite , fullerenes . however , up to now there is no theoretical treatment for thin shell magnetization in the framework of a single theoretical model , i.e. the thomas - fermi ( tf ) model . on the other hand ,<n> experimental studies have shown that one can control the magnetization by applying an external field , such as pressure @x we show that permalloy - based micromagnetic devices can be used as spin qubits .<n> the spin qubit is initialized in a vortex state , which is separated from the monodomain state by an onion state . using a simplified theoretical model ,<n> we demonstrate that the interaction between the vortex state and the onion state leads to the remanent state with the magnetization distribution close to uniform , while it is tangential in the side view , as observed in recent experiments . <n> the application of micromagnetic qubits in spintronics is a subject of active research @xcite . in the field of spintronics<n> the focus is on the devices based on ferromagnetic materials , in which the magnetic properties are determined by the ferromagnetic anisotropy of the system . as a result<n> , there is a huge amount of theoretical and experimental work on spin manipulation in ferromagnetic systems , such as , e.g. , ferromagnetic tunnel junctions , spin - transfer torque devices , etc . for each of these applications , it is important to understand the microscopic mechanism of the magnetocaloric effect , i.e. the effect of the ferromagnetism on the spin dynamics we present a detailed study of the ground state phase diagram of the two - dimensional ferromagnetic heisenberg antiferromagnets .<n> we show that the vortex state is energetically preferable one for the caps with @xmath0 nm , see fig . <n> [ fig : phd ] as initial state . in order to study the remanent vortex state we use the vortex magnetization state with polarity and chirality . for the case<n> when the magnetization and the energy of the initial vortex state are the same we use an onion state as initial one and minimize the energy for this case . by comparing energies of vortex and onion states one can see that the vorticity is almost perpendicular to the direction of magnetization for the samples with small aspect ratios . as a result<n> , we see that there is a vortex state in the phase diagram , which is not present in the uniform state for the sample with the same aspect ratios as in the case of the vortex phase . the vortex - vortex interaction in the ferromagnets<n> is one of the most important mechanisms for the phenomena related to vortices in magnetic materials @xcite . on the one hand ,<n> this interaction is responsible for the we present a detailed study of the ground state of hemispherical magnetic nanoshells , including monodomain ( onion ) state and the vortex one .<n> we proposed a simple analytical description of such states and studied analytically the phase transition between different ground states . as opposed to disks and extruded hemispheres @xcite , the phase diagram does not contain the uniform easy axis state . all results are confirmed by our direct 3d micromagnetic simulations . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of magnetic nanostructures , in particular , of the so - called hemispherical ones , i.e. , nanospheres or shells of magnetic elements , which are similar to the disks or hemispheres of magnetic materials : they consist of a nanosphere surrounded by a magnetic material of the same kind , such as an easy axis , or an onion , see e.g. refs . and references therein . in this paper<n> , we deal with such magnetic structures , and study their ground state in detail . for this purpose ,<n> we use the keldysh formalism , where the energy of the system is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues",

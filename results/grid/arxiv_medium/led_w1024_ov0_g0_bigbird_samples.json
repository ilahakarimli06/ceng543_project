      "generated": "we have performed a systematic simulation of fluidized beds , where energy injection is controlled by the flow of fluid at the bottom . we have observed the transition of fluidization and the existence of two fluidized phases .<n> we also discuss statistical quantities , which are analogous to equilibrium correspondences , and give an interpretation of averaged quantities by the hole theory for simple liquids . we study the relaxation process of a collection of particles moving in a viscous fluid .<n> we consider the case that the particles are mobile only in a limited range of the stokes number , @xmath0 . in our model ,<n> the particles move in a fixed phase and in a fluidized phase . at low flow rates<n> , we find a channel - bubble transition , where the particles in the fixed phase move away from the origin and form a channel or a path of fluid flow , respectively . for high flow rates where bubbles raise through the particle beds , the bubbling phase persists , while the channel - channel transition disappears . <n> the relaxation of a system of interacting particles is one of the most important problems in fluid dynamics . on the one hand , it is important for the understanding of transport phenomena , such as transport of particles by viscous fluid @xcite , and it is also important for technological applications such as the simulation of micro and nano devices , which are based on the interaction of particles with the electromagnetic field . however , in spite of the fact that these problems are of great importance , there is no consensus on the mechanism of relaxation , even though there is a we study a two - dimensional fluidized bed in which the relative motion of particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system . in the bubbling phase , the relaxation time of the particle velocity @xmath0 to their terminal velocity , which is determined under the case of the two - fluid limit@xcite , increases with the velocity of bubbles . on the other hand , in the channels , no relative motions among particles are observed .<n> this is because the non - relaxed particles cause the collapse of the channel . as a result ,<n> the channel - bubble transition occurs at a critical value of the flow rate . <n> we also demonstrate the existence of surprising correspondences in statistical quantities between fluidized beds which is in highly nonequilibrium states and quasi equilibrium systems . 2 in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in the study of two - component fluids in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations . among them , one - dimensional ( 1d ) fluids are of great interest because they can be realized in a variety of systems such as porous media , granular materials , biological systems , as well as thermoelectric materials . for 1d we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the viscosity of a fluidized bed . we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity obeys the arrhenius function , which is consistent with the experimental result in fluidized beds .<n> we also find a non - gaussian property in the velocity distribution functions obtained from our simulations , and this property is explained by the hole theory applied to simple liquids . <n> understanding the transport properties of granular materials is one of the most important problems in soft matter physics@xcite . in recent years<n> , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of the properties of dense granular materials , in particular , the relation between the transport coefficients and the dissipation in the system . the einstein - boltzmann ( ebb ) relation @xcite and the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdd ) ,<n> which relate the transport coefficient and the viscosity in the equilibrium state , are among the most successful theoretical and experimental results . however , it is still an open question whether these relations can be extended to the non - equilibrium state in the sense of linear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . to answer this question , many theoretical approaches have been proposed  we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of a fluidized bed of particles . we have found a continuous phase transition from the fluidized phase to the bubbling phase as the flow rate of the fluid increases .<n> we have also found that the effective viscosity @xmath0 is approximately proportional to the effective temperature @xcite . in terms of the temperature , we have defined an effective viscosity with the aid of the einstein relation , and the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity is consistent with the hole theory in simple liquids . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) pacs numbers : 05.20.-y , 05.70.-a , 64.60.-i in recent years , a lot of experiments have been carried out to investigate the behavior of granular materials . these experiments show that granular materials can be divided into two classes , _ the continuum liquids _ and _ granular materials_. in the former class , particles are immersed in a fluid and move freely , while in the latter class particles are confined in fluidized beds and move only when the fluid flow rate exceeds a critical value . it has been shown that fluidized beds have attracted much attention as a possible model for biological cells . in this paper , we propose a model of fluidized bed which is based on our previous work@xcite .<n> we construct the model by only four mechanisms , which are the inertial effect of the particles , hydrodynamic interaction between the particles and the fluid , the gravitational interaction and the contact force . using this model ,<n> we simulate the evolution of the density profile of the bed , and show that the transition from the fluidized to the solid phase is described by the critical exponent of the stokes number . <n> the most interesting feature of bed is the existence of the critical point of the transition between the solid and fluid phases . for example , when the bed is fluidized , there is a sharp transition from a fluidized state to a solid state . on the other hand , in the case of solid beds , this transition is smooth and continuous . as a result of the smooth transition , a critical point ( cep )<n> is observed in the critical region , where the density of the solid bed is twice as large as that of the fluid bed . to understand the mechanism of the cep we propose a simple model of a fluidized bed in which the fluidized beds are supported by dimples on the surface of the particles .<n> we show that the model is in good agreement with the simulation results for the relaxation of the relative velocity between two particles , provided that the dimples are sufficiently thin . in the case of thick dimples ,<n> the model reduces to the well - known lennard - jones bed model . <n> bed , soft matter , fractal geometry , hydrodynamics the recent development of soft matter has opened the possibility of investigating many phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite . among them , one of the most interesting phenomena is the fluidization of a bed . for an immobile particle , this fluidization is caused by the inertia of the surface , which makes the surface porous . as a result<n> , the surface becomes transparent , allowing the particle to move freely . on the other hand , when the surface is flexible , such as a flexible polymer , _<n> e.g. _ , flexible polymers such as dna , it is possible to confine the particle inside the bed and study its dynamics . to study such a the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction between tracer particles in the shear flow is investigated .<n> it is shown that the effective stokes number @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of a tracer to the average resistance of the fluid molecules , increases with the increase of the cut - off length . as a result<n> , it is characterized by the value of the order parameter , i.e. , the gap between the particles . <n> pacs numbers : 47.10.+g , 47.20.dr , 05.40.+j in recent years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the hydrodynamic interactions between tracers in shear flow@xcite . in this context , hydrodynamic interaction has been considered as a possible mechanism preventing the singularity in the lubrication process . from the point of view of experimental observations , we can say that hydrodynamic interaction prevents the singularity even in the absence of the gravity , provided that the volume fraction of the tracers is larger than a certain threshold value . for the same reason , in the case of the flow without the gravity the dependence of hydrodynamic interaction is suggestive even though the situation is different from the real systems .",

vanishing glueball width . the experimental evidences for the presence of a glueball in the spectrum of light scalar mesons<n> have been reported by the babar collaboration . however , this result has not been directly confirmed by the belle collaboration , who have not reported any evidence of any glueball at all . on the other hand , we present a large-@xmath0 approximation to the glueball spectrum of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .<n> it is based on the large @xmath1 limit of a large number of gluons , and it allows for bound states of scalar , tensor and pseudoscalar glueons . in this approximation ,<n> the mass hierarchy of the lightest states is in agreement with the lattice data . <n> lattice data on glueballs have been extensively used to constrain the properties of the qcd vacuum . among the many results that have been obtained , the most accurate is the determination of the scalar and tensor glueball masses @xcite . for this purpose<n> , we have developed a model able to describe the lowest states of su(4 ) gauge theory in a large range of couplings , up to the chiral limit . as a result , it has been found that the scalar glueball is indeed the lightest and that the tensor one is heavier than the scalar one , with a mass hierarchy that agrees well with lattice data in the whole range of the coupling constants . the scalar ( and tensor ) glueball has been predicted to be the lightest state of qcd in the large the spectrum of glueballs is computed in a large-@xmath0 approximation , where the gluons are described by a static @xmath1 model .<n> it is shown that there are two glueballs with the same quantum numbers as those found on the lattice , and that their masses are located on the regge trajectory . <n> the study of the glueball spectrum has been one of the main topics in qcd since the pioneering works of feynman , glueballs and glueballs @xcite . since then , a large amount of work has been done in order to understand their properties . in particular , it has been shown that the mass spectrum of any three -

      "generated": "we present results from studies of the data from the third scientific run of the ligo interferometers , and describe how they will be used in the search for inspiral signals from compact binary objects . the two ligo interferometers , h1 and h2 , are being used in a joint study of stability and dq flags . a seismic dq flag is being used to identify seismic events in the vicinity of lho , and an acoustic dqflag is being employed to identify times when the amount of light stored in the fabry - perot arms dips in intensity . during the second half of the study ( s3 ) , the use percentage for this veto was 69% .<n> this is consistent with the results of a previous study ( h1 only ) that found that there was no need to invoke a seismic upper limit to identify inspiral events in h1 , with a use percentage of 59% . in the dq study ,<n> a search was made for inspiral triggers in the h1 data , but no such events were found . the h2 detector of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) consists of two identical mirrors , a fabry - perot cavity , and a power recycling mirror .<n> ligo will be sensitive to gravitational waves up to @xmath0 hz with a peak amplitude of about 10@xmath1 at 100 hz . inspiral signals from the s3 h2 inspiral playground were found to be consistent with glitch - like events from h2 , indicating that ligo would not be completely silent for more than a minute after a glitch . <n> we present the results of a comprehensive analysis of the temporal distribution of inspiral triggers , as well as the analysis of two candidate veto channels that could be used with the h2:lsc - prc_ctrl and h 2:lsc_q interferometric signals to limit the deadtime of ligo inspiral events . as such<n> , we found that the veto channels could effectively limit the inspiral deadtime to less than 1% of the glitch time , with a veto use percentage of 66% . with these results<n> we are able to place an upper limit on the rate of gravitational waves in the 100 - 200 hz the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) is a space - based , ground - based gravitational wave observatory .<n> ligo will be used to search for gravitational waves in the frequency range from 100 hz to 10 hz with amplitudes from 10@xmath0 to 1 @xmath1 . in order to increase the sensitivity of the search to low frequency gravitational waves , the search is being extended to the full frequency range . at this time we are considering the use of vetoes to remove inspiral triggers from the ligo h1 and h2 data sets . the ligo detectors are sensitive to gravitational waves up to a strength of @xmath0 @xcite .<n> the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is important for a variety of scientific applications , such as precision tests of general relativity ( gr ) , searches for gravitational waves from astrophysical sources , and searches for new physical phenomena such as neutron stars ( snrs ) and micro - quasars . <n> the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) consists of two identical , high - sensitivity , cryogenic detectors , located in the northern hemisphere at the sites of the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) in california and the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nsc ) at the university of arizona , both in the usa . the detectors are designed to detect gravitational waves in the frequency range @x<n> 10 hz to 10 ghz , with amplitudes up to 1 thz , over a wavelength range of 100 mpc to 1 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) with the sensitivity reaching to 100 hz at 1 tev ",

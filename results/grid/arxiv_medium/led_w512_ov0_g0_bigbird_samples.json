dimensional model of channel - bubble transition .<n> we find that the transition of fluidization qualitatively changes from a channel to a bubbling phase for large @xmath0 . in the fluidized phase<n> , we observe the free volume around the mobile particles which grows linearly in the transition , while in the channeling phase , there is no free volume and the particles move in the fixed phase . <n> the transition between a fluidized and a non - fluidized state is one of the most important phenomena in fluid dynamics @xcite . to understand it ,<n> it is essential to know the phase diagram of the system , that is , how the phases are connected with each other and how statistical quantities qualitatively change from one phase to the other . on the one hand , it is important to understand the mechanism of the transition from a fluid phase to another , which is the most difficult task for theoretical studies . for example , the phase transition from the homogeneous to the incompressible fluid state is a well - known phenomenon , though it has not been well understood even though it was predicted more than half a century ago @x<n> . however , we study the phase behavior of a one - dimensional gas of soft spherical particles in a channel and a bubble . in the channel , relative motions among the particles<n> are observed , and then the gap between the mobile particles and the fixed particles is generated . when the flow rate is larger than the sedimentation rate of the suspension , the gap grows into a bubble and propagate upward through the particles , or construct a channel .<n> the channel - bubble transitions are observed in the parameter space . <n> pacs numbers : 47.54.+r , 47.20.dr , 05.40.+j 2 recently there has been a growing interest in the behavior of colloidal suspensions in channels@xcite . the rayleigh - taylor instability observed in suspensions is caused by a gap between particles . for a heavy fluid ,<n> the critical flow rate @xmath0 is determined by the falling velocity of the fluid and the gap caused by the gap propagates upward through particles and constructs a channel or a bubbling phase . on the other hand , when a light fluid exists , a similar phenomenon is observed : a gap is generated and then a bubble or a channel is constructed . here<n> we investigate the from the previous paper @xcite or in fig . <n> [ fig : eng - time ] , we have shown that the relative motion of particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system . from the result of @xmath0 ,<n> we have seen that various properties such as the flow rate in the bubbling phase , the visc - einstein effect , and the relaxation time of the velocity are dependent on the response time of velocity . in addition , surprising correspondences in statistical quantities between fluidized beds which is in highly nonequilibrium states and quasi equilibrium systems are demonstrated . we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the diffusion - limited diffusion of brownian particles in a fluidized bed . we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity is well described by the einstein relation or the fluctuation - dissipation relation in fluidized beds .<n> the arrhenius function is also found in our simulations . <n> brownian motion in a confined environment is a fundamental problem in physics . in condensed matter physics<n> , brownian particle diffusion has been considered as one of the simplest models to describe nonequilibrium phenomena@xcite . due to its simplicity ,<n> the diffusion equation has been widely used in various fields , such as physics , chemistry , and biology . however , in spite of the fact that diffusion equation is widely used , there is no consensus on the definition of the transport coefficients in brownian systems . for example , the diffusion constant of a tracer particle is usually defined by the resistance of the particle , which is an approximation of the actual transport coefficients . as a result , it is often believed that the transport coefficient is directly related to the viscosity of the tracer particle . here , we present the results of our simulations of diffusion in a brownian system in a we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of a compressible fluidized bed . we find that the effective viscosity is proportional to the non - gaussian property of the velocity distribution function , which is consistent with the experiment performed with a modified stormer viscometer .<n> we demonstrate that the qualitative understanding of the results of our simulation is possible with the aid of the hole theory applied to simple liquids . <n> shear viscosity is one of the most important quantities in the study of fluid dynamics . in the simplest description ,<n> it is given by the equation of state ( eos ) @xcite . for a non - simple system , such as a granular material or a fluid , the eos depends on the shear rate @xmath0 , and the viscosity is related to the velocity field , i.e. , enthalpy , viscosity , etc . as a result<n> , it is important to understand the behavior of shear viscosity in terms of the properties of the system s eos and the flow rate dependence of the viscosity . recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to shear viscosity as an important quantity in fluidized beds , where the we study the phase diagram of a channel model of a binary mixture of lennard - jones liquids .<n> we find that the system exhibits three phases : a channeling phase , a bubbling phase and a mixed phase . in the channeling phase<n> the system collapses to a finite size channel , and the system behaves as a simple liquid in the fluidized beds . on the other hand , in the bubbling phase the system undergoes a crossover from a fluidized bed to a phase where a free volume or a hole is generated around it . <n> pacs numbers : 64.75.+g , 64.70.pq , 05.40.+j , 68.35.rh , 47.27.-i the phase behavior of binary mixtures has been a subject of intensive studies , since it is important for understanding the behavior of many biological systems @xcite , as well as for technological applications such as liquid - crystal interfaces . while the phase diagrams of simple liquids and binary mixtures have been extensively studied , the phase structure of binary mixture has not been investigated . here , we report a detailed study of the phase behaviors of a simple binary mixture , which is a model system for recent experiments have shown that a fluidized bed behaves as a simple liquid@xcite . in order to understand the behavior of fluidized beds , we have carried out simulations with the use of a computer .<n> we have found two fluidized phases , _ the channeling phase _ and _the bubbling phase_, where the former changes to the latter as the stokes number @xmath0 increases . we have defined the effective viscosity with the aid of the einstein relation , and have found that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity is similar to that in the experiments in real fluidizedbeds . qualitative behavior of the fluidization in our simulations such as the effective temperature and the viscosity can be understood by means of the hole theory which has been used for simple liquids . <n> recently , a new type of phase transition has been observed in a system of soft particles confined in a box , which is called _ fluidization_. in experiments , it has been shown that the particles are allowed to move freely in the box as a function of the flow rate . at the same time , they are constrained by the boundary conditions to move inside the box with a certain velocity . the fluidized fluidized beds have attracted much attention as a new state of matter in recent years@xcite . in this paper<n> , we present a numerical simulation study of the motion of a fluidized bed .<n> we found that the flow field of the fluid is highly anisotropic , and that the anisotropy is strongly reduced in the vicinity of the critical point , where the flow becomes unstable and a fluid bed is formed . on the basis of the numerical simulation<n> we show that the critical points of the flow are well reproduced by the theoretical predictions . <n> recent years have witnessed a great deal of interest in the study of fluidized systems , which are composed of a solid fluid and a small number of particles , such as micro- or nano - fluidics , foams , suspensions , emulsions and porous media . among them , it is interesting and challenging to understand the flow of an incompressible fluid in which the viscosity is negligible , because the flow is impossible in the bulk of fluid , but is possible in a confined region such as a micro - fluid or a suspension of granular material . the most interesting system which exhibits fluidized flow is the bed , in which we study the hydrodynamic interaction between colloidal particles and a fluidized bed by the stokes approximation .<n> we find that the resistance matrix , which is related to the force acting on the particles from the fluid and the velocity of the fluid , depends not only on the configuration of particles but also on the fluidized chamber . as a result<n> , we find the transition from the laminar flow to the turbulent flow . to clarify the origin of the transition ,<n> we calculate the two - body resistance matrix in a model of fluidized beds and adopt the method in stokesian dynamics to calculate the force . <n> colloidal particles are colloidal particles which are immersed in a fluid and interact with the fluid through frictional forces @xcite . due to the long - range hydrodynamic interaction , the colloidal particles become unstable and float on the bottom of the bed . in order to understand the behavior of colloidal particles , it is important to consider the interaction between the particles and the environment . for example , colloidal particles in a bath are attracted by the wall and move away from the bath . on the other hand , in a bed of a liquid , particles can be trapped by the walls of the chamber and the fluid in a previous paper [ phys . rev .<n> e , * 84 * , 051601(r ) ( 2011 ) ] , we have shown that the relaxation time of a bed in a two - phase fluidized system is inversely proportional to the resistance of the fluidized bed . in this paper<n> we show that this result can be generalized to the case of a mobile bed , but only if the resistance relation is modified to take into account the fixed particles in the system . for the case<n> that all forces acting on the particles balance , the relaxation process is determined by the inertia of the particles , which causes the relaxation on the velocity @xmath0 from the initial value to the optimal value where the inertia is determined on the steady state , namely , _ the terminal velocity _ , i.e. the value determined on a steady state with the initial inertia . on the other hand , in the case that the mobile bed is not fluidized ,<n> the relaxation of the bed is caused by the non - equilibrium relaxation process of the mobile particles . <n> _ introduction _ in recent years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the we propose a model of a fluidized bed in a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( 2d - oscillator ) system .<n> we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the model and find that the model behave like the real fluidized beds , where collisions are so frequently occurring that the singularity of the lubrication effect is prevented from some mechanisms . <n> pacs numbers : : 05.20.dd , 05.70.fh , 47.20.dr _ introduction _ the fundamental understanding of fluidized systems is one of the most challenging problems in theoretical and experimental physics . in particular ,<n> the continuous description of the fluid in the gap between the particles breakdowns when particles approach closely and the gap becomes comparable to the mean - free path of the molecules , which is a common situation in the fluids of biological cells @xcite , is very important for the understanding of the breakdown mechanism . on the other hand , in the fluidization of a bed of colloidal particles , collisions between particles<n> are very frequent because the inertial term of the motion diverges at the mean surfaces contact . as a result , it is natural to ask , what is the mechanism preventing the singularity in the lubrication ? in this we investigate the hydrodynamic interaction in the lubrication in the framework of the stokes equation .<n> it is found that the effective stokes number @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of a tracer to the hydrodynamic friction , increases with the increase of the cut - off length . in the case of the gravity<n> , it is characterized by the value of the order parameter . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) lubrication plays an important role in a wide variety of applications , such as lubrication coatings , surface treatments , adhesion , microporous membranes , emulsions , etc@xcite . it is well known that hydrodynamic interaction plays a crucial role in these systems , and it is expected that the behavior of the system is determined by the hydrodynamic interactions . on the other hand , in the context of the lubrication of the fluid , hydrodynamic interaction is not so simple , because the system consists of a large number of particles , so that it is difficult to find a simple relation between hydrodynamic interaction and the total resistance of the tracer . from the point of view of hydrodynamic interaction , we can say that the",

dimensional ( 2d ) quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a powerful tool to study the properties of strong interactions in the infrared ( ir ) and the ultraviolet ( uv ) domain . in 2d @xcite ,<n> the qcd vacuum is described in terms of gluons and quarks , which are confined to a single spatial dimension , i.e. , a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) . for a given gauge group and gauge coupling , it is possible to construct an effective theory in which the degrees of freedom are reduced to a one - dimensional ho and a set of coupled channels , one of which corresponds to the vacuum polarization of the constituent gluons . at the same time , gluons are no longer confined to the ho : they are free to propagate in the ir and uv domain , as long as they have the existence of glueballs , glueballs made of three quarks and two gluons , has been observed both on a lattice and in simulations .<n> we show that any glueball can be obtained as a bound state of a two - body system with three adjoint sources of large-@xmath0 . in a flux - tube picture<n> , we also find a glueball that is a four - gluon one , as suggested by a constituent gluon picture . <n> the search for glueballs has been one of the main topics in lattice qcd @xcite . among the many glueball candidates ,<n> the one with the largest mass is that of the lightest scalar state : @xmath1 is the number of quarks , and the mass of the glueball has to be as large as possible . on the other hand , there are also glueballs that are not scalars , but are bound states of a quark - antiquark pair @x<n> . these states can be also found on the lattice : for example , the lightest state is a scalar glueball @x , that was observed to be at first present in the scalar - pseudoscalar masses of the glueball states of su(3 ) and su(@xmath0 ) are computed in the quenched approximation , using the dyson - schwinger ( dos ) method .<n> the @xmath1 glueball has to be made of at least four gluons . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the aim of this paper is to provide an estimate of the mass of the lightest glueball state of su(2 ) , which has been recently predicted on the basis of the lattice qcd @xcite . for this purpose ,<n> we have first computed the spectrum of glueballs in quenched qcd , both in the continuum and in the dos approximation . in both cases<n> , we have found that the spectrum is well reproduced , with the exception of a few low - mass states , for which the lattice results are not compatible with our semiclassical estimates . as a by - product of this work , masses of all the other low - lying states have also been obtained . *<n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.pn , 14.40.aq we compute the spectrum of two - gluon glueballs in @xmath0-@xmath1 yang - mills theory .<n> the low - lying glueball spectrum is reproduced at best to a high degree of accuracy by a fit to the lowest - lying spectrum of scalar glueballs computed on the lattice in quenched approximation . in order to obtain the two - cluster glueball masses ,<n> we couple the two clusters to be identical and to satisfy at best the mixed symmetry of the four - gluonic state . <n> we also compute the gluon and string masses . according to the pinch technique study @xcite , nonperturbative effects generate a nonzero gluon mass , which is computed from the zero - momentum limit of the gluonic propagator . # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the study of glueballs is one of the simplest ways to understand the properties of the lightest glueballs . from the point of view of a theoretical description of these particles<n> , it is natural to ask what happens to the glueball when the gauge group is changed . to answer this question<n> one has to understand how to renormalize the mass of the scalar we propose a new scaling rule for gluelumps and glueballs in @xmath0-@xmath1 lattice qcd with gauge group su(2 ) .<n> we find that the lightest scalar glueball has a mass of about 1 tev , while the lightest gluelump mass is twice the lightest one . for the scalar glueballs ,<n> we compute the evolution of their mass versus the gauge group , and compare it to the lattice results . <n> glueballs are the lightest bound states of the gluonic field , which are bound states when a static , color adjoint , source , is added . in this case , only one constituent gluon is then necessary to form a color singlet . within our model<n> , we also compute the masses of some glueballs including highly excited ones ; they compare very well with the lattice data as shown in table [ tab ] . since the discovery of the su(3 ) gauge group @xcite , a large amount of work has been done to understand the behavior of glueballs and other bound states , such as gluelump , scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector , in @ a dynamical model relativistic kinematics plus linear confinement leads to a satisfactory , although not fully quantitative , agreement with the glueball and glue lump masses found in @xcite .<n> our model leads moreover to a simple prediction concerning the modification of the glueballs masses with respect to a change of gauge group . <n> lattice qcd has reached a precision at which the spectrum of light dynamical degrees of freedom , the so - called glueballs and glue lumps , is reasonably well known . in the light of this progress ,<n> it is interesting to revisit the question of the gluon mass spectrum in qcd , in particular in light of the new lattice data on the lightest glueball masses , @xmath0-@xmath1 , recently reported by _<n> s. j. dudek _ , _ r. g. richards _ and _ j.g. edwards _ [ arxiv:1104.5152 ] . the first part of our work is devoted to the study of the structure of the light glueball spectrum in su(3 ) lattice gauge theory , with the aim of comparing the results with the available lattice data . for this purpose we present a model - independent analysis of the @xmath0 process , which is the decay of a light vector boson .<n> we consider the contributions of vector mesons up to dimension eight in the operator product expansion ( ope ) , where the vector boson decays into a pair of pseudoscalar higgs bosons . in the ope<n> , the vector - meson coupling can be extracted from the ratio of the decay width to the branching ratio for the decay . as a result ,<n> we are able to determine the value of the coupling constant for the process and find that it is consistent with the measured value . <n> the study of rare decays of light hadrons is an important tool in the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and the determination of the sm gauge group . at the tevatron @xcite , a new charmonium - like state with a mass of about 400 gev<n> was discovered . with a decay width of about 10 gev , it has the potential to be the most narrow charmonium ever observed . to search for this new state<n> requires accurate theoretical predictions of its decay properties , as well as precise we discuss the role of @xmath0 in the determination of the qcd phase diagram .<n> in particular , we show that the recently measured value of the proton magnetic moment is consistent with the standard model prediction , if one allows for a non - standard quark content in the effective lagrangian . <n> the study of the properties of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in particular<n> , it is important to understand the dynamics of qcd in the infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) domains , where the theory is known with high precision . at high energies ,<n> the ir and uv domains correspond to the infrared and ultraviolet limits , respectively , of the physical observables @xcite . as a consequence , the determinations of the fundamental parameters of the theory , such as the temperature and the mass of the quarks and gluons , as well as the strong coupling constant , are very difficult . on the other hand , at very low energies ( or in the presence of new physics ) , one can derive information about the physical quantities that are not accessible to ir or uv we propose a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) based on the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .<n> we assume that the sm is spontaneously broken at a high energy scale , above the tev scale . in this scenario ,<n> the sm couplings to fermions , neutrinos , and photons are all suppressed due to the breaking of the sm gauge symmetry by a chern - simons term . as a result , the fermion masses and mixings are strongly suppressed , compared to the sm values . we show that this scenario can naturally account for the small neutrino masses , small mixing angle and large neutrino mixing angles . <n> _ introduction : _ it has been known for a long time that the smallness of the neutrino masses can be explained by the symmetry breaking induced by the presence of a new symmetrized gauge group @xcite . however , this symmetry breaking has not been directly observed in the lepton sector , where it is very small . on the other hand , in the hadron sector<n> , it is of crucial importance to search for new physics effects at the lhc , which can be induced by we present a lattice qcd calculation of the lowest - lying two - gluon states in the large-@xmath0 limit .<n> the calculation is performed using a non - perturbatively @xmath1-improved chiral quark model , in which the gluon fields are treated in the same way as the quarks in the original lattice calculation . in this way we are able to take into account the non - linearities in the chiral expansion , as well as the dynamical gluon mass generation . <n> the study of the properties of the qcd vacuum is one of the main goals of present and future high - energy colliders @xcite . at present<n> there is no theoretical framework that allows to describe the vacuum in a consistent way , both on the lattice and in the continuum . as a consequence ,<n> it is very important to improve on the present knowledge of the low - energy effective theory , and in particular on the description of chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the vacuum . the chiral effective theory ( cet ) , based on the renormalization group ( rg ) approach , has been very successful in describing the low energy properties of qcd ",

band electron system is a central issue in the physics of high temperature superconductivity . in the simplest case of a superconductor with spin - triplet pairing ,<n> the pairing gap is proportional to the spin -

band superconductor is not the same as a double - band superconducting system . as a result  we investigate the stability of the lifshitz - gilbert model of superconductivity in a two - band hubbard model with interband coupling .<n> we show that this model can be mapped onto a one -

band term . the coupling between the two bands is assumed to be short - ranged , with the hopping term being the hund s rule coupling ( hrc ) term , while the interband term is the ising interaction ( i ) . for a 2d ising system , this ising - hrc term is known as the hubbard @x we present a general method for extending the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) approximation to any order in the bcs - bec crossover region .<n> we show that there is only one coherence length near @xmath0 , and that the order parameters are proportional to each other , so there is a single length scale in the crossover region near the fermi surface . at the same time , there are only two coherence lengths near the band edges , which results in a unique length scale for the crossover . <n> recently , it has been shown @xcite that the crossover from bcs superconductivity ( sc ) at low temperatures to the bec at high temperatures can be described by an extended ginzberg - landa ( g-l ) equation ( el ) . in this paper<n> , we provide a general formalism for extending this approximation to arbitrary order . using the fact that the gap parameters in the sc and bec regions are identical ,<n> we are able to show that the extended g- l can be written in terms of only two parameters , the superconducting gap and the coherence length , both of which can be calculated from first principles . we consider the effect of higher order corrections up to @xmath0 on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity in two bands .<n> we find that the range of convergence of the gl theory is now much wider than that of the conventional gl theory @xcite , and that a larger number of corrections increases the range in which the infinite sum is expected to converge . in the case of a single band superconductor ,<n> the procedure is fairly straight forward . for two band gl , we report the result for the first three terms in the expansion . <n> pacs numbers : 74.20.fg , 74.25.dw , 74.72.-h , 71.27.+a the ginizburg - lifshitz theory ( g - l ) , also known as the landau theory , is one of the most widely used methods to describe the ground state properties of superconductors , with applications ranging from cuprates to high temperature copper oxides . while it has been used for many years , only recently has it been applied to a large number of materials , including cuprates , for which there has been much recent interest we study the effect of an interband coupling on the critical temperature of a two - band hubbard model . using an extended ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism ,<n> we show that the interband interaction has a large effect on both the dominant band s critical temperature , @xmath0 , and the order parameter of the second band , which is @xcite .<n> we also show that in the small coupling limit , the order parameters of both bands are identical , while in the large coupling limit they are different , with the dominant order parameter being an enhancement of the dominant gap temperature . <n> 2 the study of strongly correlated electron systems has a long history , starting with the pioneering work of bernevig , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) in the 1950 s , who predicted the existence of a metallic state with two energy bands , one for each spin quantum number . in recent years<n> , this prediction has been verified in a number of systems , including high-@xmath1 cuprates , heavy fermion superconductors and quantum hall systems . the bcs - bcs theory has been extended to include the we study the effect of an interband coupling @xmath0 on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( gl ) series for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in the presence of a magnetic field .<n> we find that the gl series does not converge to the exact solution in the limit that the coupling goes to zero , and that the expansion converges slowly or diverges in the region where the coupling is small , but converges very slowly in the opposite limit . <n> we also find that there is a pivot point above which the magnitude of the gl terms decrease , while below this point the magnitudes of the terms remain approximately constant . at this point ,<n> the gl solutions of the dominant bands are affected , with the gl solution of the smaller band showing non - convergent behaviour , even though the gl convergence for any small non - zero coupling is very slow or convergent . in the case of strong interband interaction , we find a critical value of the coupling which separates two degenerate ground states , one of which is unstable with respect to the formation of a topological superconductor , from the other which is stable . the land in this paper we have extended gorkov s ground - breaking theory of the two - band hubbard model to allow multiple bands and large order in @xmath0 .<n> the theory has been used to show that in the presence of a magnetic field , the bcs solution is only valid in a narrow temperature range near the critical temperature of the dominant band . with these parameters ,<n> we have reconstructed the relationship of the theory with the standard bcs theory . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of a fermi gas in a uniform magnetic field has received a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in order to understand the behavior of fermi gases in magnetic fields , it is necessary to consider the problem in the regime where the fermi energy is much larger than the temperature . for this reason<n> , there has been an extensive amount of work done on calculating the magnetic field dependence of the energy gaps in fermionic systems , and in particular in two - dimensional fermi systems . at the same time , much work has been done on understanding the effect of an external magnetic field on the properties of a system in the absence of a field . however , in the we examine the validity of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for the order parameter of multiband superconductors .<n> we demonstrate the importance of @xmath0 expansion for the two band case , where the gl solution is found to be nonconvergent . in the three band case<n> the point of inflection around the largest critical temperature , is shifted to a lower temperature compared to the one band gl solution , and is enhanced by the interband coupling . for a two band superconductor ,<n> higher order corrections for the inter band coupling play a pivotal role in enhancing the smaller order parameter above the critical temperature in the bcs model . at lower temperatures , however , we find significant deviation from the gl theory , especially when the two gaps are dominant . <n> [ [ section ] ] in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in the study of superconductivity in multiband systems @xcite , in particular in the case of high temperature superconductor ( htsc ) , sr@xmath1ruo@xcite ( sro , ybco ) and srtio(pb ) @ we review the generalization of the abrikosov -

to-@xmath1 mixing . <n> we present our predictions as a cut - flow chart for all the considered benchmark points and the invariant mass distributions of bb pairs . we study the possibility of detecting a standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson decaying into a pair of light gauge bosons ( @xmath0 ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> we consider the case when the higgs mass is in the range of 125 gev to 350 gev , the mixing angle in the mixing matrix is in between 100 and 120 gev and the decay width is in a narrow range . <n> the discovery potential of the lhc with a center of mass energy of 7 tev and a luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath1 is quite promising @xcite . at present , there is no theoretical model which gives a good description of the properties of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) which has been tested by experiments at the tevatron , rhic and lhc ( see ref.@xcite for a review of experiments carried out in this field )<n> . one of the most attractive features of this model is that it predicts the existence of a higgs - like scalar boson which decays into two light gauge - bosons the higgs discovery at the kamiokande @xmath0=14tev collider ( lhc ) has opened up a window to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in the form of extra neutral bosons ( b s ) . in this letter , we study the possibility of identifying two b -

proton collisions , cp violation ( cp )<n> can be directly measured by observing the decays of top quarks into bottom quarks and we propose a new method of extracting the value of @xmath0 , the ratio of proton to neutron rapidity gaps .<n> we show that this ratio can be determined with good accuracy , provided that the rapidity gap in the neutron sector is known _ a priori _ , that is , if the proton and neutron rapidities are known within the same kinematic region . <n> the proton - nucleus rapiditygap in the nuclear matter has been measured with great precision @xcite . in the proton sector ,<n> the data are consistent with a narrow range of values of the proton s mass and neutron s radius , while in the deuteron sector the range is much wider , indicating that the proton is in a deconfined , rather than a chirally symmetric , phase . for the neutron<n> , there is no data available , so it is expected that the neutron mass is much larger than the proton mass , and vice versa for the proton as well , since the proton radius is much smaller than the debye radius in both the cases . the proton<n> neutron and proton - antiproton rapidities have been measured within a wide range of proton - proton we propose a new method to measure the cp violation parameter @xmath0 in the lepton sector of the standard model ( sm ) .<n> we show that the measurement of the cp asymmetry in the decay of the top quark into a bottom quark and a photon can be used to extract the cp phase @xcite . in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )<n> , the sm - cp phase can be extracted by measuring the cp - odd decay amplitude of top quarks into bottom quarks and a lepton , as well as the cp asymmetries in the production of top and bottom pairs at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the three - body decay of top - quark pairs . <n> cp violation is one of the most important unsolved problems in particle physics today , with important implications for the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and for the nature of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) that exists in the universe . at the present level of precision in the measurements of cp violation in lepton and quarkonia ,<n> the the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start running at a center of mass energy @xmath0 tev in 2014 .<n> one of the main goals of the lhc is to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in particular<n> , the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) and extra dimensions ( extra ) will provide crucial tests of the sm and will shed light on the origin of fermions , bosons and neutrinos . here<n> we report on a search for susy and extra symmetries in topologies with two jets and missing energy . <n> susy is a theory of new physics that predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles , beyond the sm , with large masses , large couplings and new gauge interactions . at the tevatron @xcite ,<n> the first signature of susy will be the observation of superparticles decaying into two jets , as in the case of the higgs boson , and missing transverse energy , in the final state of top quark pair production , which can be observed in the di - jet channel , or in the missing energy channel . we present the first measurement of @xmath0 , the spin - averaged transverse momentum , in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .<n> the measurement was performed using the cms detector at the lhc , covering the rapidity range of 120 gev@xmath1 @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,<n> the quark - antiquark pair in the nucleon is assumed to form a bound state with a mass of about 200 mev , which decays through the emission of a virtual photon , leading to the production of a lepton and a jet . <n> the properties of this bound state have been the subject of much interest , both theoretically and experimentally , since the early 1980s . during the last decade<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of this state , mainly due to the progress in the understanding of the qcd dynamics at high energies , particularly in view of the recent measurement by the atlas and cms collaborations of the branching ratio of the vector meson of the second lightest quark , @x , as well as the measurement of the inclusive cross section of the hadronization of the @x we present the first publicly available implementation of pythia6 , an event -

perturbative qcd ( nrqcd )<n> , it is natural to ask whether the chiral transition is a crossover or a phase transition . to answer this question ,<n> it is important to find an order parameters that describe the transition , especially in the we study the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar meson , @xmath0 , using a nonperturbative method based on the chiral quark - hadron duality . we find that the mass is consistent with the experimental value within the error bounds .<n> we also study the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , and find that it does not change the mass significantly . <n> it has been a long - standing problem whether or not the chiral symmetry of the qcd vacuum is broken . in the early days of qcd @xcite , it was pointed out that there is a problem in the definition of the quark mass in the standard model ( sm ) , which is called the mass gap . since then , various approaches have been proposed to solve this problem , among which the simplest one is to consider the vacuum as a chirally symmetric configuration in which the masses of the light quarks and antiquarks are the same as those of the strange quarks . however , the solution of the massgap problem has not been universally accepted . on the other hand ,<n> it is well - known that the chirally - symmetric vacuum has a mass gap of about 0.5 gev  we consider the effect of a non - zero @xmath0 in the gluon propagator on the energy spectrum of the proton .<n> we find that the effect is crucial for the proton energy spectrum near the threshold for the onset of gluon bremsstrahlung . in a recent paper @xcite , we have shown that in the non - perturbative regime , where the proton is at rest , the energy spectra of the neutron and the deuteron can be well described by the phenomenologically successful brueckner - hartree - fock approach . as a consequence ,<n> the proton acquires a small non - vanishing gluon mass , which is in agreement with recent lattice qcd calculations . here<n> we extend the analysis to the case where the gluons are at rest in the proton and we find a similar result . <n> the study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and density is one of the main goals of present and future high - energy physics experiments . at present<n> the energy density in the qgp is sufficiently low that qcd is a good description of the low energy dynamics of the system . however ",

known regular gf mc scheme , the obtained transition probabilities can exhibit sign changes , such that the walkers can change from one configuration to another . in the general case ,<n> the estimate of the multiplicity of a walk is given by the product of the transition probabilities , with a weight factor which depends on the distance between the two configurations of the walkers . as an example<n> , we apply our scheme to the random walk of lennard -

field wave function and a trial antiferromagnetic ( af ) wave function<n> , we find that the sign problem can be avoided in the af calculation , and that the fixed - node method yields an upper bound for the energy which is very close to the exact value . in the case of the half -

dimensional ( 2d fixed - node and nodal - relaxation monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods are presented for the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for two - dimensional lattice fermions .<n> the method is based on the sign structure of the trial wave function , via the ratios of the wave function in neighboring configurations with different signs . in order to significantly improve the results ,<n> the sign problem has to be overcome , and one has to change the sign in individual configurations , in addition to changing the sign of the hamiltonian itself . <n> we compare the gga results with those obtained by other methods , including the recently introduced constrained path method , for different values of the parameter @xmath0 , such as on a square lattice , a cubic lattice . for both methods<n> , we find that the gaussian gga is the method of choice , with the nodal relaxation method being less stable , both for the energy and for the observables that can be calculated , as the convergence is slowed down for larger parameter values , due to the sign problems that appear in the calculations . *<n> pacs numbers : * 71.10.fd , 71 we compare the fixed -

known that the nucleus - nucleus amplitude in the so - called optical approximation ( oase ) @xcite is in correspondence with the amplitude of the direct scattering of the light nucleus by a target nucleus . in the present paper<n> we extend the oase to include the interaction between the projectile and the target . as a result<n> we get a strong modification of the optical amplitude , which is in qualitative agreement with the results of direct scattering experiments , but in a quantitative agreement with oase it does not lead to the exponent in the cross section which is supposed to be given by the optical model . *<n> pacs : * 24.10.-i , 24.30.gd , 25.30.fj , 27.20.+n in the field of nuclear physics , the interaction of the nucleus with the target nucleus is one of the most important processes . for example  it is shown that the evolution in rapidity @xmath0 of proton - nucleus scattering amplitude can be performed in a numerically tractable way by choosing the initial state to be a single propagating pomeron .<n> the rapidity dependence of the total cross section and of its differential distributions is discussed . <n> one of the most important problems in the theory of hadron - hadron interaction is the description of pomeron - pomeron scattering in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite-@xcite . in this case<n> the pomeron amplitude is given by the solution of the equation which describes the evolution of a function of rapidity , scaled by the momentum transfer @ x , and two parameters : the scaled rapidity and the ratio of the scaled to the non - scaled rapidities . for the case of nucleus - nucleus interaction<n> this equation can not be solved analytically ( note , however it can be solved numerically in older papers ) so one is compelled to recur to numerical methods for the solution . here<n> we present the most straightforward approach of evolving the amplitude in the most natural way : by choosing a single initial state as a pomeron and solving the equation numerically . as an example rapidity dependence of the ha and propagator couplings in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is studied in the framework of the semi - classical glauber model .<n> it is shown that in the limit of very high rapidities ( @xmath0 is close to the threshold of the reaction ) the coupling to the initial projectile state becomes important . in this limit ,<n> the amplitude for the reaction can be expressed as a sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the projectile - target coupling in the infinite nucleus and the other one is a high - order derivative with respect to the rapidity step in the runge - kutta method . <n> rapidity - dependent ( ha ) couplings are important in the description of reactions of heavy nuclei in high energy collisions ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a recent review ) . to describe the interaction of the projectile with the target one has to solve the schrdinger equation ( sde ) @xcite , which is a non - perturbative problem in the sense that the interaction can not be treated as a perturbation of the hamiltonian . as a result , in the case of rapidity we present a calculation of the rapidity dependence of the soft pomeron induced @xmath0 transition amplitudes for light nuclei .<n> the calculation is performed in the framework of the eikonal formulation of the pomeron - nucleon interaction and it is extended to the case of the proton . <n> pacs number(s ) : 21.65.+f , 21.45.+v , 24.10.jv the study of the fan - pomeron interaction @xcite , a non - perturbative treatment of the interaction between pomerons and mesons , has proved to be a useful tool to investigate the properties of nuclei close to the nuclear surface . in particular<n> , it can be used to study the propagation of the excited states of the nucleus close to its surface , that is , in the so - called  drip lines '' , or in the vicinity of the nuclear drip lines , where the effects of the strong interaction can be more clearly seen . as well known , the inclusion of pomeron effects in the description of the propagation and the structure of finite and infinite nuclei is not straightforward , but it is also an important issue of nuclear physics . we study the dependence of the hanbury - brown and twiss ( ha ) amplitudes for @xmath0 , 27 , 64 and 125 on the triple pomeron coupling and the rapidity at which they are measured .<n> it is shown that the amplitude with loops taken into account correctly describes the results for finite nuclei . at comparatively high rapidities<n> the amplitudes with loops are found to be very weakly dependent on the coupling constant , but strongly dependent on rapidity . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the pioneering works of hanbury and brown @xcite on the pomeron - exchange mechanism in heavy - ion collisions , there has been a great deal of theoretical and experimental effort to understand the underlying mechanism of the mechanism . in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )<n> this is achieved by the introduction of a mass term for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the so - called pomeron vertex , which is proportional to the exchange of one gluon and one pomeron on the proton and neutron , respectively . as a consequence<n> , it is well known that in qcd at low momentum transfer ( lmc ) the hadron production in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions is considered in the framework of the pertubative qcd including contributions from loops .<n> it is shown that for finite nuclei the model with contribution from loops included gives reasonable results up to very high energies . for realisitic nuclei with finite atomic numbers @xmath0 the standard infinite series of fan diagrams in the regge theory for ha amplitude converts into a finite sum . with the elementary hadron cross - section rising at large energies this finite sum preserves physical meaning only up to a certain maximal energy , which in fact is not very large and goes down with the rise of the triple pomeron coupling . inclusion of loop diagrams may cure this situation . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the process of high energy hadronic collisions ( hics ) is one of the most interesting topics in nuclear physics . in particular it is very important to understand the mechanism of the hic @xcite and in particular to find out what is the origin of the high energy part of the cross section of hadrons produced in hic . to this end<n> there is a lot of theoretical and experimental work we show that the perturbative qcd cut series for the @xmath0 scattering amplitude can be understood in terms of an infinite set of fan diagrams .<n> we also show that for finite nuclei the analytic continuation involved in making the cut series to converge seems to somehow take the loop contribution into account . this conclusion , as mentioned , could explain the success of using infinite fan diagrams in the description of ha amplitudes both in the local regge theory and the phenomenological qcd . <n> the author thanks the bologna physics department and infn for their hospitality . in this paper , we present a new method for the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> this method is based on the use of the time - resolved intensity modulation ( trm ) technique , which allows us to detect the gw signal with higher sensitivity than previous methods . <n> gw detection is a very important tool in the field of gravitational wave astronomy . in recent years<n> , gw signals have been detected from a variety of sources , including gravitational wave detectors ( gwsd ) @xcite , gravitational wave interferometers (  gauge - invariant interferometry , mips ) and ground - based gravitational wave observatories ( gwu+gsos )@xcite<n> . however , the detection sensitivity of these methods is limited by the sensitivity of the detectors to small perturbations , and the detection efficiency of the technique is often low . as a result ,<n> the sensitivity is often limited to only a few tens of nm , even for the most sensitive detectors . here<n> we show that the trm technique can be used to detect gravitational waves with sensitivity up to 10 times better than the gw or mips techniques .",

nucleon and nucleon - isobar coupling constants and a one - boson - exchange parameterization of the bonn potential .<n> the pionic exchange currents are derived from a chiral lagrangian and lead in lowest order to the seagull and in - flight currents and to the currents contributing to direct knockout . due to their isospin structure<n> , these currents can only contribute to pn emission in a direct knockout model . at short internucucleon distances<n> they are mainly due to meson exchange and can be neglected in a hadronic model of pn production . to account for the isoscalar form factor of the @ x(3872 ) , a monopole form factor with cut - off mass 1200 mev<n> is used . the meson exchanges are calculated using the continuity equation with the one pion exchange potential ( opep ) and the nonrelativistic reduction of the current is done with the help of chiral lagrangians . photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons has been studied in the framework of nonperturbative qcd .<n> the photon energy was varied from threshold up to a few gev@xmath1 . for photon energies above the latter we found that the total exchange current , which includes pion and rho exchange , is the main contribution to the @xcite@xcite currents related to the intermediate nucleon , i.e. , the total and the seagull exchange currents , as well as the pair current . <n> the contribution of the total seagull current is found to be larger than that of the intermediate currents by a factor of about 2 . in order to study the influence of the seagull currents on the photonuclear cross section , we have also calculated the currents associated with the excitation of intermediate particles to the first excited state of the nucleon by the intermediate photon . the current related to intermediate pion excitation was calculated nonrelativistically . it was found that pion exchange is the dominant contribution to this current for energies below the threshold of the second excited state . at higher energies ,<n> the contributions from pion , rho and @ the cross sections for the @xmath0o(@xmath1,pn ) and @xcite reactions are calculated in a nonrelativistic coupled channel formalism , where the two emitted nucleons and the photon remain in the same plane .<n> the hole states are described with harmonic oscillator wave functions , which allow to study the different absorption mechanisms . at low photon energies the interference between the exchange currents arising from the two low mass isovector mesons<n> is found to reduce the cross section , indicating the importance to incorporate the exchange of the isoscalar pion . <n> pacs numbers : 25.20.lj , 25.30.fj , 21.45.+v electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is one of the most important methods to investigate the properties of hadronic matter . in the last years<n> a large amount of work has been done to understand the mechanism of eit in hadronic systems , e.g. by the methods of chiral perturbation theory , and more recently also by the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) . for the description of the electromagnetic interaction the coupling of the hadronic system to the electromagnetic field we investigate the structure of the differential and total @xmath0(p ) cross sections in nucleon - nucleon collisions .<n> we perform calculations with pionic degrees of freedom and an effective cut - off parameter in the hadronic form factors . in order to explore the dependence of the cross sections on the corresponding nuclear structure factor , the outgoing proton and neutron angles<n> are determined through maximizing the strength of the nuclear reaction . by doing<n> this the missing momentum p can be more or less kept constant over the covered proton angle range and the large functional dependence on the angular cross section on the function f(p) can be ruled out . # we study the angular cross section of the @xmath0o(@xmath1,pn ) reaction at a fixed missing momentum p , as a tool to understand the underlying physics of the reactions . we have calculated the cross section at photon energies @xcite .<n> we have also compared the results obtained when only pionic degrees of freedom are accounted for . in the present paper<n> we study angular cross sections for the reactions @x , nn and nn@xcite at a given value of the missing momentum . <n> the calculation of the cross sections has been carried out in the bonn approximation for the nucleon - nucleon potential . to this end , we have used a bonn potential which has been derived earlier from a study of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons and pions in the vicinity of the deuteron . from this study<n> it is possible to extract the values of the parameters of this potential which are necessary to reproduce the photon energy dependence of the total integrated cross section . as a consequence ,<n> we can study the behaviour of the differential cross sections as a function of the p value , which is of particular interest in view of the experimental efforts to actually measure we have studied the reactions ( @xmath0 ) , ( s ) and ( p ) at intermediate photon energies .<n> we have compared the cross sections obtained in different approximations and have found that in general they differ in detail . in particular , we find that the commonly adopted approximations give rise to results that differ quite drastically from those obtained in a direct knockout model . <n> 24.2 cm 17.0 cm -1.0 in -42pt plus 2 mm minus 2 mm 23.0 cm -2.1 cm * mesonic effects in photonuclear reactions * + * at intermediate energies * + a. khodjamirian + _ department of physics , university of maryland , college park , md 20742 , usa _ + and + s. k. leontaris +<n> _ nuclear and particle physics division , argonne national laboratory , + argonne , il 60439 , u.s.a . the contribution of the ( @xmath1,pn ) channel to the total photoabsorption strength in a proton -

body physics . in high energy collisions , it gives rise to a number of interesting phenomena , such as the suppression of the gluon - gluon plasma in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and the observation of superconductivity in neutron - proton collisions . at the same time<n> , photoabsorption can also be used as a tool to investigate the structure of the nucleon - nucleon medium , in particular to study the role of fermi - surface interactions ( fsi ) and the nature of the fermi surface ( fs ) . as a consequence , the study of photoabsorption has a long history , going back to the ( @xmath0 ) cross section has been calculated using the factorized gottfried approach at intermediate photon energies .<n> the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to the effects related to @x , @xcite and @x<n> meson degrees of freedom has been investigated . in particular , it has been shown that the shape of the angular cross sections at a fixed missing momentum p is sensitive to the effect of @x,@xcite meson absorption when an effective cut - off mass of 800 mev is introduced in the hadronic form factor . we study the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in the framework of the @xmath0 factorization formalism .<n> the nn interaction is defined as the interaction between two nucleons of opposite parities , which in the small-@xmath1 approximation are described by the gari - hebach - matsumoto ( gim ) and the kurtfried - gottfried ( kwg ) potentials , respectively . in this approach ,<n> the coupling constants of the interaction are determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter , while the parameters of the potentials are fixed by the requirement of the stability of the eos of the nuclear matter . as a consequence , we find that in the case of the gim model , the two potentials satisfy each other up to a critical coupling constant , above which they do not satisfy the kwg condition . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.39.fe , 13.75.lb , 14.40.ev , 21.65.+f , 24.85.+p in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of we study the @xmath0 dependence of the gluon distribution in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we show that the observed rapidity gap between quark and gluon distributions in the qgp can be accounted for by the effect of gluon bremsstrahlung in the strongly interacting medium . <n> the study of high - energy heavy - ion collisions has a long history . in the early 1980s<n> , it was realized that the properties of the hot and dense medium of ultrarelativistic heavy ions could be determined from the measurement of the distribution of gluons ( quarks ) in the medium @xcite . at the same time , the understanding of the mechanism of quark production in hadron - hadron collisions was developing . during the 1990s ,<n> the first measurements of the dilepton invariant mass distribution at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider at cern ( lhc ) were performed . for the first time<n> the distributions of both gluons and quarks were measured in the same experiment , which allowed the identification of the source of the observed",

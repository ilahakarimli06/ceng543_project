[  [ fig : optplane ] ) has been derived for low-@xmath8 ( @xmath90.7 ) quasars and is luminosity dependent since the fwhm boundary between pop .   [ [ fig : optplane ] ] is a and b is luminosity dependent @xcite . setting a proper rest frame    is of special importance since outflows in quasars are suggested by the detection of blueshifted absorption or emission components of spectral lines if shifts are interpreted as due to doppler effect ( for a dissenting view see @xcite ) .    the maximum shift amplitude decreases as well .    b1 sources account for the wide majority of pop .    b : their  and  profiles are similar , and profile parameters like centroids and asymmetry occupy overlapping ranges @xcite .      b1 is the most prominent of the quasars , and this trend has been recently explained with the progressive demise of the wind component @xcite .    b1 is an interpretation of the blr that seems to be supported , at least in part , by micro - lensing of the blr @xcite involves three main regions : ( 1 ) a relatively stable region whose dynamics is predominantly virial , associated to a symmetric unshifted emission in emission lines ; ( 2 ) an outflow region revealed by emission line blueward asymmetries or by a component systematically blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of the quasars . and nlr prominence may serve as quantitative evolutionary parameters .      several works stressed since the mid-1980s that lils and hils have to be emitted at least in part from different media @xcite .     the effect of the strongest winds may have important effects on the very structure of the blr @xcite .    the effect of the blueshifted component in  and other high ionization lines seems to be present in most spectral types . only in spectral type b1@xmath5    the effect of the blueshifted component seems to be present in most spectral types .     it is irrelevant and undetectable or almost so in bin b1@xmath6 .     these bins are the ones with the largest fraction of rl frii galaxies @xcite .     it appears reasonable that the presence of axial , powerful relativistic outflows may hinder the propagation of a strong disk wind as observed in radio - quiet sources @xcite .     it is interesting to note that extreme pop .    is a sources still show an unperturbed  component .    it appears that a stable equilibrium might not easy to measure because it depends on the intrinsic doublet ratio ( that is only approximately known ) and to a lesser extent on the estimate of the underlying  emission .    a small shift by @xmath48   would be overlooked in most previous studies ( it was found in @xcite , although not at a significant level because of the large uncertainty ) .    in addition to the small systematic shifts in bin a3 and a4 ( see fig .

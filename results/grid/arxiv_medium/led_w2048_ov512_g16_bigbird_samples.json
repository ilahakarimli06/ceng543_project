metallicity regime , recombination due to resonance - line photons<n> is found to dominate over that due to reemission in the far line wings , leading to an overall increase in the recombination rate by about a factor of two over the rate calculated using the milne relation . for metallicities<n> = [ z / h]@xmath1 , the dielectron recombination rate is found at a level of about 1 per cent of the total recombination rate , which is much lower than is found in the solar neighborhood we present a new method for calculating x -

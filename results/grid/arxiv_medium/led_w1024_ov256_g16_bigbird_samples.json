equilibrium systems , such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and superfluids @xcite . among them , phase transitions play an important role in controlling the behavior of a system even in the absence of any external force , as has been demonstrated in the case of becs @ we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a fluidized bed . we find that the relative motion of particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system .<n> in fact , bubbles are always accompanied by the convective motion of the particles . as a result , we observe a channel - bubble transition with increasing the relaxation time @xmath0 of the velocity of a particle . in the bubbling phase ,<n> we observe some qualitative changes in the physical quantities such as the viscosity and the critical flow rate , which can be interpreted in terms of the einstein relation and the fluctuation -

rate dependence of the viscosity obeys the arrhenius function , which is consistent with the experimental result in fluidized beds .<n> we also find a non - gaussian property in the velocity distribution functions obtained from our simulations , and this property is explained by the hole theory applied to simple liquids . <n> understanding the transport properties of granular materials is one of the most important problems in soft matter physics@xcite . in this context ,<n> it is important to understand the relation between the transport coefficients and the dissipation in the system , in particular , the non - equilibrium transport coefficients , such as the viscosity and the diffusivity , play an important role . recently , there has been a great progress in the understanding of the transport and dissipation properties in granular materials . for example , it is now well known that the diffusion constant of a granular material is proportional to the square of the resistance of the material , @xmath0 , where the diffusion coefficient is defined by the einstein relation , [ eq : einstein - fb ] . on the other hand  we simulate the behavior of a simple liquid in a rectangular box . we find that the average behavior of the height of the center of mass is independent of the stokes number @xmath0 and the flow rate .<n> we also find the qualitative change of the transition area and the homogeneous phase in the simulation . in a recent experiment@xcite , it has been observed that a liquid expands and becomes denser as a function of temperature , and that the size of the fluidized bed increases logarithmically with the increase of the temperature . <n> it is believed that this phase transition is of fluidization type , i.e. , the volume expansion of the liquid is accompanied by a decrease of the viscosity . to understand this behavior , we propose to use the hole theory in simple liquids , in which the viscosity is characterized by the activation energy to generate the free volume . here<n> we will show that the simulation results are qualitatively similar to the experimental ones , except for the behavior in the bubbling phase , where we can not reproduce _ homogeneous phase _ , which is also observed in the experiment . from this observation<n> we conclude that the phase transition in experiments is not of fluidized type . we have studied the behavior of a fluidized bed in the stokes approximation . we have carried out numerical simulations with the change of two control parameters , the flow rate of the fluid and the effective stokes number @xmath0 .<n> we have found two fluidized phases , _ the channeling phase _ and _the bubbling phase_, where the former changes to the latter as a function of the flow -

standing problem whether the fluidized beds are composed of elastic particles or not@xcite . to answer this question<n> , it is important to understand the mechanism of fluidization of the system of the inelastic particles , because this mechanism is the essential one in real systems , such as granular materials and fluids . for this purpose ,<n> it is necessary to consider not only the inertial effect of the particles but also the hydrodynamic interaction among them , since this interaction is the we propose a model of fluidized beds , in which particles are confined by the walls of the bed and interact with each other through the inertia of the fluid .<n> hydrodynamic interaction among particles through the fluid is represented by the contact force @xmath0 , which is calculated under the stokes approximation , where the inertia is assumed to be the impulse by prefect elastic collisions . in our model , the force acting on the particles from the fluid and the velocity of the particles are related by the resistance matrix @xcite . @x<n> contains all information about the interaction and depend only on the configuration of particles . on the other hand , fixed particles<n> are not considered in our simulation , because the model is dissipative . for simplicity , we only discuss the case without fixed particles in the following discussion . <n> when a fluid is confined in a bed , particles can not escape from the bed due to the existence of the walls . as a result ,<n> the free energy of the system is conserved . however , if the walls are present , it is possible to obtain the equilibrium distribution of the free energies of particles by the fluctuation theorem . here<n> we show for the first time we propose a model of a fluidized bed in which the fluidized beds are separated by a gap between the mobile bed and the fixed bed . in this model ,<n> the gap becomes comparable to the mean - free path of the molecules in the case of large inertia .<n> we find that the relaxation process of particles is described by the stokes equation , and the relaxation time is proportional to @xmath0 . <n> recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the problem of the fluidization of beds @xcite . for example , it has been shown that the motion of a bed can be described by a langevin equation of motion ( liom ) with a force - velocity - friction ( v - fd ) relation , where the friction term is given by the contact angle of the bed with the wall . as a result<n> , there has been a lot of work on the dynamics of fluidizedbeds , including the theory of the hydrodynamic equations of motion , the kelvin - helmholtz equations , as well as the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations ( fdrs ) . from a physical point of view<n> the most interesting situation is that of a we present a model for lubrication in shear flow .<n> the model consists of a fluidized bed with a cut - off length , where the hydrodynamic interaction between the fluid molecules is described by the effective stokes number @xmath0 . in the lubrication ,<n> particles approach with each other in a finite interval , which is determined by the lubrication criterion : the average resistance of a tracer with the same volume fraction is less than that of a reference fluid . as a result<n> , the lubrication singularity is prevented . <n> it is well - known that the shear flow with the gravity has a singularity@xcite . here<n> we show that the lubrication in the presence of the gravity is also singularity - free , if we consider the lubrication as a continuous system , i.e. , we do not have any collision between the particles . to see this we perform numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations of motion with the help of the monte - carlo method , and compare the results with those in the real systems . from the simulation results<n> we can conclude that the singularity of the lubrication can be prevented from some mechanism in the fluidized beds , for example , by some dimples on the",

band coupling , making it difficult to distinguish experimentally between a bcs superconductor and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . as a result<n> , it has been difficult to determine the superconducting gap in these systems , even though the gap itself is known to be strongly suppressed in the cuprates . however , recent experiments have found that the gap in the optimally doped cuprates is very small , so it is not clear whether this is due to bcs or bec effects , or whether the superconduct we calculate the zero temperature properties of a two - band hubbard model with interband coupling and arbitrary sign of the hopping integrals .<n> we find that the gap @xmath0 has a non - trivial dependence on the coupling constants , and that the critical temperature is enhanced over that of the uncoupled first band , regardless of sign . <n> _ introduction _ recently , it has become clear that a variety of strongly correlated electronic systems , such as cuprates , manganites and heavy fermion compounds , can be described in terms of two or more electronic bands @xcite . in many of these systems<n> , there are two bands , each with its own band structure , which can be coupled by interband hopping . at half - filling ,<n> the two bands have the same density of states , but with different band indices , so that the system is often referred to as a one - band system . however , when two bands are coupled , they can have a different dispersion relation , leading to the term g - l for the combined system , where g is the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian of the one band system and l we present an extended ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) theory for multi - band superconductors .<n> the theory is applicable to any band with a non - zero density of states at the fermi level , and has no free parameters . in the single band case ,<n> the lowest order corrections are of order @xmath0 . for two bands<n> , we find that there is only one coherence length , which is near the fermion - degeneracy point of the bcs solution . <n> superconductivity is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature @xcite , appearing in a wide variety of materials , from metals to condensed matter systems . despite its ubiquity , there is currently no consensus on the mechanism responsible for the onset of superconduction , although it has been suggested that it may be associated with the formation of cooper pairs in the superconducting state . to date , most theoretical work has focused on two bands of electrons in a superconductor , such as the high temperature superconducting cuprates , with the aim of understanding the mechanism by which cooper pairs form in this regime . however , it is not clear how they form , or even whether they form we study the effect of an interband coupling on the critical temperature of a two - band hubbard model .<n> we use a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach , and find that the dominant band is stable with respect to small perturbations in the interband interaction , while the other bands are subject to strong perturbations . in the single band case , we find that there is a critical value of the coupling strength below which the second gap disappears , in agreement with a recent bcs result . for two bands ,<n> we show that the gl results are in general in good agreement with the results from bcs theory . <n> 2 introduction 2 the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath0 , describing a system of two or more bands interacting through a nearest - neighbor interband potential , is a central model in condensed matter physics , as it is the only model that can describe a variety of strongly correlated systems , including high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite , quantum hall systems @x<n> . however , the study of this model has been hindered by the fact that it is , at the same time , plagued by a number of problems  we present an exact solution to the problem of a two - band hubbard model with interband coupling @xmath0 in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> the solution is valid in the entire range of parameters where the two gaps are comparable in magnitude , including the region where the magnetic field suppresses spin - orbit coupling . in this regime , we show that the bcs and gorkov - gl approximations give very different results for the gap equation , with the gl approximation being only valid in a very small temperature range near @xcite . however , when the interband interaction is increased , the relationship between the gl and bcs approximations is restored , and the range of validity of the gl solution is extended . <n> the study of strongly correlated electron systems has a long history , starting with the pioneering work of bernevig and bohr @ xcite on the magnetic properties of metals . since then , a wealth of different systems have been studied including high temperature superconductors , high temperature mott insulators , quantum spin liquids , as well as high-@xmath1 cuprates and heavy fermion systems , to name a few . the hubbard we calculate the order parameter and critical temperature of a multiband superconductor within the gorkov - landau ( gl ) approximation .<n> we show that the gl approximation is valid only in a very small temperature region near the critical temperature , @xmath0 , and therefore should be used with care . in the case of a two band superconductor , we find that the interband coupling plays a pivotal role in enhancing the smaller order parameter above the bcs value in the two band case . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + ++ + + /- this paper is a continuation and extension of the paper of bert , kim and hikita , phys . rev . lett . *<n> 81 * , ( 2012 ) 011006 . here<n> we present the results of a calculation of the order parameters and critical temperatures for a superconductor with multiple bands in the presence of an external magnetic field . to start with ,<n> we have considered a uniform system , but have restricted the discussion to the case where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the layers , since this is the case for most experimental superconductors @xcite  we study the effect of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) on the phase diagram of the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> in particular , we show that the soc can either enhance or reduce the critical temperature for the transition from the nel state to the paramagnetic phase , depending on the value of the ratio of the coupling constants . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the physics of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from the ising - like to the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) phase @xcite . in this letter<n> we consider the phase transition in the xxz anti - centrosymmetric model of spin - orbital ( som ) coupled heiss - fermion ( h - f ) superconductors in the case of an applied magnetic field of arbitrary strength . for this purpose ,<n> we have considered the case when the coupling between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom of the system is weak , i.e. , when the effective soc is small compared to the electron mean free path , and studied the behavior of the",

mills theory ( ssmt ) . in this method ,<n> the gauge invariant configurations are decomposed into triality sectors , and the statistical weights of the gauge configurations are evaluated by measuring the fermi , dirac and cumulant fields in the triality sector . as a result<n> , one can define an order parameter , which is the ratio of statistical weights in the different sectors . from this quantity , the phase diagram of the system can be obtained , even in the thermodynamic limit , if the system is quenched . at the same time , in the quenched case , there is no phase transition , since the spontaneous breaking of the symmetries is not invalidated , as in we investigate the confinement - deconfinement transition in su(2 ) gauge theory with dynamical quarks .<n> we consider two prescriptions that are free from the direct charge - screening effects by quark loops and enable us to clarify the confining nature of a vacuum . in the first prescription<n> , we use fermionic determinants ( @xmath0 ) , while in the second one , polyakov - loop s absolute values are evaluated in zero - triality sector and in the confinement sector , respectively . on the one hand ,<n> the distribution of a polyakov loop is round - shaped both at the boundaries between sectors in the deconfining phase and at the confinement phase , and the deviation from this round - shape is reflected in the fermion determinant , which is much smaller than that of apolyakov loop . such a prescription could single out the confinement nature of the vacuum properly and independently of the direct screening effects or the string - breaking effects . <n> the study of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the most important problems in theoretical physics , since it is closely related to the strong - interaction physics in the standard model ( sm ) and the we investigate the chiral properties of the qcd vacuum in the light of the recent lattice qcd results . in particular , we focus on the behavior of the quark condensate and the chiral condensate as functions of quark masses and couplings . <n> the chiral symmetry of qcd is one of the most important and fundamental questions in modern physics .<n> although it has been well - established that the standard model ( sm ) has the correct chiral symmetry for massless quarks and gluons , there are still many open issues such as the nature of chiral symmetry breaking , confinement , and confinement - deconfinement transition . to answer these questions ,<n> it is of great importance to investigate the properties of hadrons produced in heavy - ion collisions , which can be used as a testbed for chiral symmetry and the mechanism of confinement . at present<n> , it is believed that the chiral phase transition is of first order , but it is not clear whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous . as is well - known , the chiral transition is a discontinuous transition in qcd . on the other hand , in the presence of strong interactions , perturbative qcd approaches to the chiral",

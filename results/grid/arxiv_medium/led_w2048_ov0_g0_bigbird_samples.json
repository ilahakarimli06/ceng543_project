      "generated": "we study the structure of the balitski - kovchegov ( bk ) amplitude in the toy model of a pomeron field with a non - hermitian interaction .<n> we establish the relation between the sum of fan diagrams and the full amplitude . the rapidity @xmath0 dependence of the cross section for elastic nucleus - nucleus scattering is calculated in the glauber approach .<n> it is shown that the amplitude depends on three variables : the scaled rapidity , the ratio of the initial and final rapidities , and the atomic number of the target nucleus . in the limit of very high rapidities<n> the amplitude is given in terms of only two variables , one of which is proportional to the scattering cross section in the optical approximation . <n> elastic scattering of nuclei is one of the most important reactions in nuclear physics because of its important role in the understanding of the structure of nuclei and in the formation of the first excited states of heavy nuclei @xcite . for the description of heavy - ion collisions at intermediate and high energies one<n> usually resort to the so - called optical approximation which assumes that the initial state of the projectile and the target are in the same physical state , that is , they have the same quantum numbers . however , this approximation fails at high energies and/or for nuclei with large values of the bjorken parameter , which is the case for example for light nuclei like light elements , where the effective coupling to the nucleus is the amplitude for the inclusive process @xmath0 with triple pomeron coupling is calculated for nuclei with different numbers of valence nucleons .<n> it is shown that the finite sum of fan diagrams correctly describes the amplitude up to a certain value of rapidity , after which the result sharply blows up practically to infinity . for finite nuclei the amplitude with loop contributions<n> is found to be practically identical with the one which corresponds to the infinite nucleus . at large rapidities<n> the found amplitude is weakly dependent on the initial amplitude at zero energies , so that it is formed completely from loop contributions . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , the so - called higgs mechanism has attracted a great deal of interest in particle physics and nuclear physics . among many possible mechanisms the mechanism proposed by hamitonian and glashow<n> is the most attractive , because it can explain the origin of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , one of the most interesting phenomena in nuclear physics today . in this mechanism<n> the pomeron exchange between quarks and gluons is responsible for the formation of the qgp from the decays of hadrons . the in this paper , we present a new method for the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> this method is based on the use of the time - resolved intensity modulation ( trm ) technique , which allows us to obtain the intensity profile of the gw signal . in this way<n> we are able to detect gravitational waves with an angular resolution that is ten times better than with the conventional trm technique . <n> gw detection is one of the most studied techniques in the field of gravitational wave astronomy . due to the high sensitivity of gw detectors to small changes in the local environment<n> , it has been shown to be useful in many fields , such as cosmology , gravitational wave detection , astrophysics , earth and planetary sciences @xcite . however , the detection efficiency in these fields is still very low , @xmath0 , even in the most advanced detectors such as the lisa gravitational wave detector , einstein telescope or space telescope . as a result ,<n> detection is still a very challenging task , especially in the case of gravitational - wave detection in the earth s gravitational field , where the sensitivity is still so low that no detection is possible",

of - view . in the second epoch<n> , we find an excess of the counts from the point source pwn over those from the background , which can be explained by the increase in the pulsar luminosity . the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around sgr a@xmath0 is one of the most interesting objects in the sky .<n> the pwn was observed by the bepposax satellite in 2004 and 2006 , and both observations show evidence for a significant increase in the pulsar luminosity . in this paper , we present the analysis of the 2006 data , which provides the best constraints on the pulsar emission properties in the energy range from 0.5 to 9kev . we find that the spectral and flux variations in the 2006 pwn can be well explained by the luminosity increase , while some small - scale features show significant flux and spectral variations . young planetary nebulae ( pwne ) provide a unique laboratory for the study of the early stages of stellar evolution .<n> one of the best - studied examples is the pwwn associated with the isolated neutron star ( ns ) sgr a@xmath0 , which is located at a distance of @xmath1 kpc @xcite . in 2006 ,<n> the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) acquired a deep exposure of this object with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) mode . using this data , we report the discovery of a compact nebula , pwn , at the center of the previously - known pwn , with a luminosity of @ xmath2 erg s@xcite and a total flux of the order of the total flux in the acs field of view . <n> the compact nebula has a relatively soft spectrum as compared to the innermost part of many other young pwnes . also , regions along the symmetry axis are systematically harder than the surrounding emission , and the overall spectrum softens as one progresses to larger scales young pulsars are known to produce a wide range of emission features in their wind nebulae ( pwn ) , including jets , clumps , and hotspots @xcite . however , it is not clear if the variability is caused by the pulsar spin - down ( psf ) process , the pulsar wind nebula ( pwne ) magnetic fields , or the combination of both . here<n> we report the results of a multi - epoch , multi - wavelength , _<n> hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observation of the young , energetic pulsar b1937 + 21 .<n> this is the second observation of this source , which is known to be a highly variable pwn with a double -

ray space telescope .<n> the pulsar was observed twice , in 2000 and 2006 . in the 2000 observation ,<n> the spectrum was much softer ( @xmath1 ) and the unabsorbed flux increased by a factor of 6 , while in the 2006 observation the spectrum became much softer and the flux only changed by a factors of 4 , suggesting a 6% increase in the observed flux . due to spectral softening , the spectrum of this pulsar in the 0.5 - 10kev range was found to be softer by about an order of magnitude , compared to the spectral index of the first epoch . <n> pulsars are rotating neutron stars ( nss ) , powered by their roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) @xcite , which results in a large spin - down energy , and hence a large emission of gravitational radiation ( gr ) in the energy range of the gev to the tev range . among the pulsars<n> currently known , psrsj1810 we report on the second observation of psr b0831 + 21 performed with the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) in 2000 and 2006 .<n> this pulsar was discovered in 1995 by the parkes pulsar survey with a spin - down rate of @xmath0ms@xmath1 , and it is one of the brightest persistent pulsars in the sky , with an average flux density in the 1 - 8kev band of about 2ctss @xcite . since then , numerous pulsars have been discovered in the northern hemisphere , including several young pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . among these ,<n> psrs b0831- 21 and b1937 + 21 are probably the most well - studied , because of their long duration , high pulsar luminosities , low nebular reddenings and the fact that they are associated with nearby young stellar objects ( ysos ) that have masses and sizes similar to those of our own solar system . in 2000<n> , the lat discovered a new young pulsar in the nearby , nearby pwn ( j1821 + 21  we report the discovery of a planetary nebula ( pwn ) around the pulsar b1937 + 21 .<n> this pwn was discovered using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on the _ rossi x -

field imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array ( wifea ) at an effective resolution of about 1milliarcsec ( fwhm ) in the energy range from 100ev to 1tev the young pulsar g21.50.9 ( kes 75 ) is located in the supernova remnant ( snr ) , ngc 7293 , and is the nearest snr to us ( @xmath0mpc ) with a projected distance of only 2.4kpc .<n> it was recently reported that hess has detected tev gamma -

10kev band to the reported detection of tevatron flux in 0.3 -5tev range suggests a low magnetic field , which is comparable to that of g20.1.50.9 . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : pulsars : individual : g we report the discovery of a new pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around the young pulsar sdss j0920 + 0235 .<n> the pwn is elongated in the north - south direction , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula , and has an arc - like feature in the northeast , which we interpret as a toroidal shock . <n> the young age of the system suggests that it is likely to be in the free expansion phase of the nebula . in general , we find that the inferred pressure for the nebula is @xmath0dyne@xmath1 , consistent with the magnetic pressure inside the nebula and the supernova reverse shock having not yet reached the nebula boundary . we report the first detection of a young pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in a supernova remnant ( snr ) . using the _ chandra _ x -

jet - like feature is not detected , indicating a large velocity in the polar outflow . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : pulsars : individual : crab pulsar : general nebulae we report the discovery of variability in the inner jet of the pulsar psr b0833 - 24 , which was observed with the fermi large area telescope in 2006 .<n> the jet varies in flux by a factor of @xmath0 on timescales of days to weeks . during this time , the variability amplitude increases by more than an order of magnitude , reaching a maximum at a time when the jet is bright enough to be detected by fermi - lat . at the same time<n> , there is no significant change in the jet s spectral shape , indicating that the variability is not due to a superluminal motion in the polar outflow , as has been suggested by previous studies , but is most likely due to changes in the magnetic field and synchrotron cooling time of the jet particles . <n> pulsars are excellent laboratories for the study of high energy emission from a compact object . in particular , pulsars emit most of their energy in the energy range of a few kev @xcite , where observations with the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) have revealed a new class of pulsars , namely pulsars with relativistic jets we present an analysis of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of psr b150958 .<n> the x - ray flux has increased by a factor of @xmath0 since the last chandra observation in may 2005 , accompanied by a dramatic increase in the strength of the pulsar s radio emission , which has been accompanied by an order of magnitude decrease in the size of the polar outflow . in the new observations ,<n> the inner and outer jets have been detected for the first time , as well as several faint pwn clumps , all of which are consistent with being the result of interaction between the pulsar and the supernova ejecta . <n> the new data reveal a number of interesting features in the jets , including rapid variability on timescales of a few years , strong spectral variability in the inner jet region , and abrupt terminations at the northern and southern pwn regions . we discuss possible origins for the jets and conclude that they can not be due to doppler boosted motion in the pulsar outflow , mhd instability , particle injection from a shock , or non - thermal emission from the shock interaction with the ambient medium . the recent discovery of we present x - ray and radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr b150958 obtained with _ chandra _ and _ xmm -

fit by the blackbody component , it could be related to the shock accelerated particles . the variability of the northern clump can be attributed to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , as psr j18460258 is one of the most energetic young pulsars known , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath0ergss@xmath1 .<n> the pulsar is surrounded by a nearby pwn , and has been associated with thermal x - ray emission since its discovery in 2000 . here<n> we report on two _ xmm - newton _ observations of the pulsar and pwn in 2000 and 2011 . in the quiescent state ,<n> the spectrum is well fitted by a power - law model with a photon index @xcite , which is slightly shallower than the blackbody component in the 2000 data , but still consistent with the power law model . for the first time , we detect the thermal emission from the pwn at two epochs , in addition to the long - term light curve . at the first epoch , the pulsar had a luminosity of more than 10ergs@xcite and a distance of about 19kpc , while in the second epoch the luminosity decreased to about 2ergs @x<n> . the distance estimate of 6kpc greatly reduces the pulsar luminosity by an order of magnitude , making it an outlier among young we present a spatial and spectral analysis of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr j18460258 in kes 75 based on deep chandra observations .<n> we model the pwn as an axisymmetric outflow with jet and torus features . from the x - ray emissivity<n> , we deduce an average pwn field of @xmath0 g and interpret the arc - like feature in the northeast as an equatorial outflow , either a toroidal termination shock or an equatorial wisp . applying a torus fitting scheme ,<n> we show that the arc has a radius of 2@xmath1 , inclined to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle of 2 degrees . we also deduce a minimum flow velocity of 0.4@x.1 based on the non - detection of a counter jet . over a period of 6 years , the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability , which could be attributed to mhd instabilities . accompanying the recent outburst , pulsations have increased by 6 times and show substantial spectral changes . the pulsar luminosity has increased by six times in the last 6 years and shows substantial variability . psr j18460258 is the only known example of magnetar - like bursts inside a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . here<n> we report on the long - term x - ray monitoring of this pwn with the chandra observatory from 1996 to 2008 .<n> the pulsar was in a relatively quiescent state during this period , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . during this time , several bursts occurred in the pwn and the luminosity of the pulsar increased by a factor of 6 . in this letter<n> , we present the results of our analysis of the x - rays observed with chandra between 1996 and 2008 , during which time the pulsar luminosity has increased by more than six orders of magnitude , the spectrum of the source has softened and there is an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , which could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : neutron pulsars : general supernova remnants . we present an analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the crab nebula observed by the h.e.s.s .<n> experiment , which is based on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) @xmath0-band data , supplemented by data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , _ fermi _ gamma -

markovianity of a quantum state .<n> the test is based on the wald - wolfwitz hypothesis of the asymptotic non - negativity ( asn ) , which is the minimum of the test s negativity under two assumptions : ( i ) the state is a pure quantum state and ( ii ) there is an additive noise ( a noise source ) in the system . <n> wald s theorem @xcite is a fundamental tool in the theory of non - classical states of quantum systems . in this theorem ,<n> the asn of a given quantum state is defined as the difference between the negativity of the state and the value of the corresponding quantity of a classical state @xmath0 . as a consequence of this theorem<n> , it is possible to define tests for non - positiveness of quantum states . among these tests , the one proposed in the present paper<n> is particularly interesting : it is the first test of this kind , based on a non - commutative test , that is , a test in which the state of the system is not a pure state and there is no additive noise in the the optimal estimation of the sample size required to minimize the error on the test statistic is considered .<n> it is shown that the expected sample size can be estimated with an accuracy better than @xmath0 , where the error is defined as the difference between the expectation and the actual sample size . <n> the problem of estimating the optimal size of a test statistic has been extensively studied in the last years @xcite . among others ,<n> markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods have been applied to this problem . in them , the test is chosen so that its asymptotic behavior is given by the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . as in the case of mcmc methods , it is sufficient to apply markov s inequality , which states that , given a probability distribution of the parameters of the model , one can estimate its distribution by means of a mcmc test . indeed , markov chains are asymptotically equivalent to gaussian distributions , so that mcmc tests are optimal in the sense that they minimize the expected error . on the other hand , in practice<n> , a finite sample size is not enough for this purpose  we present a family of tests for sub - optimal markov chain monte carlo sampling .<n> the tests are based on a new family of @xmath0-norm tests , which are optimal in the sense that they do not depend on the size of the sample , but only on its variance . as a consequence ,<n> these tests are also optimal in terms of sample size , even when overshoots in the sample size are ignored . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- + + _ introduction _ markov chains are a powerful tool in the study of quantum many -

ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometer ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs . [ 1 , 2 ] and [ 3 , 4 ] for a review on this topic , and , more generally , to study the in this paper we present a new approach to the identification of targets in multi - resolution radar applications .<n> the approach is based on the analysis of the stationary distribution of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the detected target , which , in turn , is obtained by solving a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . as a result<n> , we obtain an efficient algorithm to estimate the number of targets that may be present in the surveillance area . <n> radar , target detection , radar interferometry , stationary distribution , pdf . in this work<n> we are interested in the identification and , thus , the reconstruction of the target position in radar applications where the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) may be high , e.g. in airborne applications , where the relative radial velocity between target and radar may exceed mach-2 . for this purpose ,<n> we consider the radar problem characterized by the inherent presence of multiple - resolution elements ( which correspond to range  bins ' as well as doppler , elevation and azimuth , respectively ) but all of these approaches concern the case that the target is not allowed to change its position while being we propose a new radar concept for the detection and , in the case of multiple targets , for the estimation of the distance to the target .<n> the concept is based on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) radar array , equipped with a 2d - doppler interferometer and a 1d - elevation - range - azimuth radar , and a single - target detection scheme . <n> radar interferometry is a very powerful tool for target detection and estimation @xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the interplay between the target detection capabilities and the target estimation capabilities : in particular , if a single target is present in the field of view , then the detection capabilities are strongly affected by the presence of other targets . on the other hand ,<n> if a large number of targets are to be detected , the estimation capabilities are also affected . here<n> we show that , under certain conditions , a simple two - stage radar array can be used to efficiently deal with the problem of target detection , estimation and target mobility estimation : the first step is to select the best resolution element in each frame , based on the signal - to - noise ratio ( a sequential test for trajectory estimation in an exponentially distributed radar system is presented .<n> the procedure is based on a stopping time test and truncation of the test is used to limit the resulting asymptotic signal - to - noise ratio ( asn ) . <n> the impact of the procedure on the system performances as well as the problem of the final threshold setting is explored through monte carlo simulations in terms of asn and , also , the probability of correct track estimation . in the last years<n> , a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of high - precision radar measurements @xcite . for example , in order to estimate the position of a moving object with high accuracy in a radar scenario , it is necessary to estimate its trajectory , which can be achieved by a variety of methods , such as , for instance , astrometric follow - up , radar interferometry , etc . the basic idea behind<n> all these approaches is that the system should be able to detect the motion of the object , and then , based on the detected position , estimate the trajectory of interest . as a matter of fact ,<n> a well - known example of such the effect of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) on the estimation of the position of a target trajectory is investigated .<n> it is shown that the snr does not affect the extrema of the absolute tracking error ( asn ) , provided that the prior transition probabilities are sufficiently compact . on the other hand , it has been shown that more compact priors allow more accurate detections . <n> tracking and recovery of a moving target is a crucial task in many applications , in particular in high - precision metrology and radar applications @xcite . in radar , the target is assumed to be a moving , rigid body , which is detected and tracked by an array of detectors located at different locations , separated by a finite distance ( @xmath0 ) from the target , where the tracking is performed using a  radar interferometer '' ( rdi ) located at the same site . the track of the target trajectory , _<n> i.e. _ the set of coordinates where the trajectory is most likely to be found , is expected to be detected by the rdi array , since the detection is based on the _ position _ ( p  in this work , we propose a novel method for the joint estimation of the position and momentum of a moving target , based on a quantization of the trajectory followed by a time - domain radar detection .<n> the proposed method is based on the use of a single snr in the quantization step , thus allowing for a compact prior on the target position . <n> pacs numbers : : 03.67.-a , 42.50.dv , 42.65.hw , 02.60.pn . the ability to detect the position of a target moving with high accuracy is of paramount importance in many applications . in particular , in the field of high -

state systems , and show that , in general , the markov process is ergodic . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of stationary distributions of markov chains is an important topic in random matrix theory ( rmt ) , as well as in ergodic theory @xcite . in particular ,<n> stationary distributions play an important role in the characterization of ergodic systems : they are key ingredients in the proof of the stationary probability distribution ( pdf ) of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , which describes the time evolution of the system . on the other hand , stationary distributions are not available in the context of non - markovian , multi - state , systems . as a result<n> , it is not clear whether stationary distributions can be considered as  ergodic '' , i.e. , they can not be expressed as stationary relative to a random shift . the aim of this note is to show that stationary distributions in this paper , we introduce a new class of random matrix ensembles , which we call @xmath0 random matrices .<n> they are obtained from i.i.d . <n> stationary distributions of random variables , and , thus , can be considered as a generalization of the well - known gaussian random matrix ensemble ( grmle ) . here<n> , the density of states ( dos ) of these random matrices can be computed exactly , as well as their mean - square displacement ( msd ) and variance . as an application ,<n> we show that the variance of the dos of random matrices of finite size can be expressed in terms of a single parameter , called the _ variance _ of the underlying random matrix , that can be chosen to maximize the variance for a given distribution . in turn , this allows us to calculate the variance in the regime of large but finite sizes of the matrices , i.e. , when the number of underlying random variables tends to infinity . the mean - squared displacement of a random matrix can be defined as the maximum value of the variance over all realizations of the random matrix that satisfy certain conditions . in this note , we prove that , if @xmath0 is a uniformly integrable markov process with drift and diffusion coefficients , then the kullback - leibler divergence is equal to zero if and only if the drift - diffusion coefficients satisfy a certain condition .<n> more precisely , the following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the drift and the diffusion coefficients are non zero ; ( ii ) each of the cesro - cantelli functionals is a density of stable points of the markov chain ; and ( iii ) there exists a unique integrable sequence which is not integrable and which satisfies the condition ( ( iv ) . <n> ./style / arxiv -

known gaussian process . for this purpose ,<n> we first derive a large deviations result for a product of markov random matrices with respect to the expectation of the process , i.e. @xmath0 , where the expectation is that induced by the vector norm . then , using this result , an expression for the large deviations of the mean first passage time ( mfp ) between the initial and the final state is obtained , as well as a formula for the variance of mfp over a finite time interval . <n> large deviations in stochastic processes has been recently studied by many researchers in diverse areas of applied mathematics , computer science and physics ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . among the many applications that have been investigated , in this paper , we introduce a new class of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) , the so - called @xmath0-exponential spde , which generalizes the classical poisson point process .<n> we show that , in this new class , there exists a neighbourhood of the origin such that ( i ) every process in the class converges uniformly in the neighbourhood , ( ii ) the rate of convergence depends only on the degree of irreducibility of the process , and ( iii ) there is a one - parameter family of stationary points such that the stationary point process converges to a poisson process as the number of iterations of the sequence tends to infinity . as a consequence ,<n> we derive the uniform convergence rate of the associated stationary point processes . <n> ./style / arxiv -

called stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , which has been recently proposed as a tool for the direct observation of the internal structure of individual atoms . here<n> we present a detailed study of a system of two - level atoms in a large optical cavity and show that a number of interesting features can be observed , e.g. : poincare resonances can be created in the decay of the atom , while the usual exponential character of the decay is not influenced by we show that the spontaneous decay of an atom placed inside a high - finesse optical cavity can be significantly suppressed if the atom is placed very close to one of the cavity mirrors .<n> this effect is related to the position dependence of the atom - field coupling constant and is called the inhibition of spontaneous emission . in the case of a two -

known example of the space - time evolution of a non - integrable quantum system , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . here<n> we study the interaction between a single atom and the field in the vacuum , described by a quantum optical hamiltonian , and with cavity photons , which are in turn described by cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) equations , in the presence of an external magnetic field . for a large class of physical situations ,<n> we find that poin car recurrence we study the spontaneous emission from an atom which is initially inside the cavity and which is placed very close to the cavity mirror .<n> we find that the inhibition or enhancement of spontaneous emission takes place for specific positions of the atom in the vicinity of the mirror , that is , for the atomic distance much smaller than the cavity decay length . on the other hand , the opposite effect - the _ enhancement _ of spontaneous radiation - takes place . we show that this difference in spontaneous emission between the free - space and the close - to - the - mirror configurations is related to the position dependence of the interaction between the atom and the cavity field . <n> recent years have seen a growing interest in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) @xcite , in particular in the field of _ cavity optomechanics _ , which studies the interaction of light fields with matter . in particular ,<n> the cavity qed has been proposed as a platform for the development of quantum information processing , as well as for the observation of new types of light - matter interactions , such as those which are beyond the capabilities of the standard model of particle physics . among the many proposals for the realization of cavity - opt we show that the spontaneous emission of a single two - level atom in a cavity can be either enhanced or suppressed by the interaction of the atom with the modes of a mirror .<n> we find that the interaction with the reflected wave packet can either stimulate or suppress the emission , depending on the distance between the atom and the mirror and the phase accumulated by the wave packet during the round trip from the atom to the neighboring mirror and back . <n> spontaneous emission ( se ) is one of the most fascinating examples of quantum phenomena @xcite . in the early days of quantum mechanics se<n> was considered as a manifestation of quantum interference , but it was later shown that se is in fact an intrinsic property of the quantum system , rather than a consequence of any specific quantum interference mechanism . during the last decades se has been identified as a key component of various quantum phenomena , such as the quantization of the radiation field , the observation of superconductivity , and the generation of bose -

organized criticality ( soc)@xcite and bifurcations of criticality @x<n> . however , it is not clear how to generalize the concept of stochastic process to situations in which many variables are involved . to this end , in the last decade , in this paper , we consider the expectation -

guaranteed , and this upper bound can be arbitrarily small . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a lower bound of @xmath0 $ ] for a given error probability , which is much smaller than the previously known upper bound @xcite . <n> quantum states are in general well - separated from each other in the sense that there is no correlation between them , but this does not necessarily mean that the state of the system can not be equilibrated . in this sense , it is natural to ask whether or not a given quantum state can be partitioned into several parts , or , more generally , whether a given set of quantum states can be in equipartition with each other . for a classical system , this is equivalent to saying that a given state is  indistinguishable '' from the rest of the set . on the other hand , for a quantum system<n> , the situation is we consider a class of multi - qubit protocols in which each qubit is subject to a gaussian - type error .<n> we show that the error probability can be made arbitrarily small by modeling the system as a noiseless system . as a result<n> , the upper bounds on the error probabilities can be arbitrarily small . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] <n> _ introduction. _ quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite is one of the most important and challenging problems in quantum information theory . in its original formulation ,<n> the error correction for a single qubit was formulated in terms of the von neumann entropy @xmath0 , which is a measure of the amount of information that can be extracted from the system , and is given by the probability that the system will not output a maximally entangled state after a certain number of measurement events . since then , various forms of error correction have been developed , such as the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method , quadrature amplitude estimation ( qam ) , schmidt transform -

called  typical set '' regime , which is characterized by the following properties : ( i ) the state @xmath0 is a pure state , ( ii ) it is in a certain  maximally entangled state '' ( mesoscopic state ) , and ( iii ) its state is a typical sequence in the sense that it is equal to the value of the maximal entangled state in the system . in order to estimate the state with high accuracy , the typical set estimator fails to output the correct estimate , due to the asymptotic outlier phenomenon ( aep ) of the state ( i.e. , when the state goes to infinity with an error smaller than 0 , but the error goes to zero as the state remains in the state . <n> estimation of a system s state is one of the most important problems in quantum information theory . due to this fact ,<n> various methods have been proposed for estimating the states of quantum systems in the past few years . among these methods , shannon  we present a new method to estimate the duration of gravitational events .<n> the method is based on the fact that an estimator can be made arbitrarily small as the cardinality of the event goes to infinity , if the noise in the estimator is not typical . as an example<n> , we apply the method to gravitational lensing . <n> pacs numbers : 04.60.pp , 04.50.+h , 95.30.sf in recent years , gravitational waves ( gws ) have been receiving a lot of attention @xcite . in the standard model of particle physics ,<n> the gravitational waveform is given by a sequence of sinusoidal functions @xmath0 , with the phase difference between the two components equal to 1 . for gw events with durations shorter than a few tens of seconds , the phase differences between the components<n> are expected to be small . on the other hand , in the case of gw event with duration longer than one second , there are two possible sources of phase difference : the gravitational interaction between the particles and the aharonov - bohm effect ( aep ) , caused by the gravitational field of the source , and the we derive a family of inequalities relating the asymptotic behaviour of the number of edges in a multiplicative stochastic process to the variance of the stochastic process .<n> the inequalities are derived from the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) principle , which states that a stochastic process is hlder continuous if and only if its variance is bounded by a constant . <n> stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology , and finance . in particular , they play a central role in the statistical mechanics of complex systems @xcite . as such ,<n> they have been the subject of extensive studies , both theoretically and experimentally , over the past two decades . despite their ubiquity , however , there is no consensus on how to relate the statistical properties of stochastic processes to the properties of the underlying complex system . for example , it is well - known that the asymptotic behavior of a large class of processes is determined by the variance @xmath0 of the process , while the asymptotics of other processes are determined by an ensemble of gaussian random variables . on the other hand , in the study of complex dynamical systems , the number @x in this paper , we study the asymptotic behavior of the error probability in the gaussian approximation to the stochastic differential equation , which describes the evolution of a quantum state in the presence of noise .<n> we prove that if the von neumann entropy @xmath0 of the system is less than or equal to one , then there exists an error probability which is smaller than the average error of the state . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a lower bound for the asymptotic error of quantum states in stochastic differential equations . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + / [ [ keywords -

body systems @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been extensively used to describe the behavior of a large class of quantum mechanical systems , such as in this paper , we consider the following problem : given a set of @xmath0 test results , find a test function that outputs a coherently chosen set of values ; i.e. , in a coherent manner .<n> this problem has been considered in various settings , such as the noiseless and the noisy systems . in the conventional group testing setting ,<n> an observation ( a test result ) consists of a binary set of input values that serves as input to a logical test function ( logical or in the above cases ) that is chosen according to the setting of the conventional gaussian group testing . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in using group testing in various areas of science and technology . for example , the use of group testing is widely used in many fields such as biology , chemistry , physics , computer science , bioinformatics , and so on @xcite . on the other hand , it has also been shown that there exists a class of test functions that can be used to test the non - classicality of a given set of data , which is called the _ noncoherent group testing_. in this problem , we consider the problem of finding the minimum number of appearances of a given type in a _ generalized noiseless system _ ; i.e. , a system of i.i.d . <n> random variables .<n> it is shown that the number of the appearances of type @xmath0 in a pooling graph is bounded by the product of the type of the graph and the type set of the pooling graph . in the case of a discrete memoryless source<n> , it is also shown that this number can be bounded by a constant independent of the amount of noise in the source . as an application of this result ,<n> we discuss the maximum likelihood estimation problem in the presence of a noiseless source , and show that the optimal estimation error rate is given by the maximum entropy principle in the noiseless case as well as in the model with memoryless sources . the maximum - likelihood estimation ( ml ) problem is one of the most important theoretical problems in the field of quantum information theory @xcite . for a given quantum system , the problem is to estimate the maximum number of its eigenstates . to solve this problem , one needs to find the minimal number of occurrences of a certain type estimation error probability is one of the most fundamental problems in estimation theory . in this paper , we present a general method to estimate the unknown parameters of a physical system by using a dynamical model system ( dms ) .<n> the method is based on the gneralization of the estimation problem . by using this method ,<n> we derive a lower bound for the estimation error probabilities of a generalized noiseless system , an @xmath0-gaussian system and a system with additive noise . <n> estimation theory has been a very active area of research in the last two decades . due to the growing interest in the estimation of physical parameters in various applications @xcite , such as , estimation of fundamental constants in physics , prediction of unknown parameters in chemistry , and many others , the problem of estimating physical parameters has a wide range of applications . for the most basic estimation problem in this area , it is important to have a general way to estimate these parameters . to estimate unknown parameters , one needs to evaluate the output of the dm , which is a monte carlo ( mc ) problem , from the input of the system . as is well known , the direct part theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of quantum theory .<n> it provides a condition for estimation of unknown parameters of a quantum system . in the binary group testing case ,<n> this condition is equivalent to the uncertainty principle , which states that one can estimate any unknown parameter of the system with the error probability given by the @xmath0th power of the number of particles in the group . <n> quantum theory is a theory that is based on the idea that a physical system can be modeled as a collection of quantum objects , each of which is an eigenstate of some probability distribution , and each of these objects can be estimated from the values of all the other objects in the collection by a direct part method @xcite . for a large class of quantum systems<n> , this direct part approach can be considered as the most fundamental theorem in the theory of quantum estimation . as a consequence of this theorem , there are a number of theorems about direct part estimation , some of which are probabilistic in nature , others are combinatorial in nature and some are non - probabilistic , see for example refs . and references therein<n> . it is well known that the error of estimation is proportional to the direct part theorem is one of the fundamental theorems in quantum information theory .<n> it provides a condition for estimating the unknown value of an observable by solving a system of linear equations . in this paper<n> , we consider the problem of estimating an unknown number @xmath0 from the information provided by an unknown quantum system , where the unknown system consists of two parts : a quantum bit ( qubit ) and a noiseless system . we prove that if the estimation is to be accurate , then the system must be noiseless , and the error probability in the estimation must be smaller than a certain threshold . as a consequence ,<n> if the noise is low , the qubit can be estimated accurately , while the noise in the measurement must be low . <n> estimation of unknown numbers is an important problem in many areas of science and technology . for instance , in cryptography @xcite , it is necessary to estimate the unknown number of bits exchanged between two parties , a sender and a receiver , with high precision . on the other hand , for unknown qubits , there is a problem called entanglement generation , which requires at least two entangled qubits to be prepared  we consider the problem of entanglement generation between two quantum systems described by the two - level ( 2l ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .<n> it is well known that the generation of entanglement between two maximally entangled qubits is possible only if the state of the system is initially prepared in a pure state . in this paper , we show that this is not the case if the initial state is prepared in an unentangled state ( e.g. , a mixed state ) and the interaction with the quantum system is weak . for this case ,<n> we derive an upper bound on the amount of entanglement that can be generated , and we prove that the upper bound is sharp . <n> entanglement is one of the most important features of quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite , quantum computation ( qc ) ( see , for example , refs . and references therein )<n> . however , entanglement is not a unique feature of quantum systems ; it can also arise from a number of other sources , such as non - local interactions between particles , non - unitary operations , etc . we consider the problem of estimating the intrinsic noise in a system of stochastic oscillators .<n> we show that the error probability can be minimized when the system is gaussian noiseless and the noise is generated by a set of generator functions . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + - + + + /- this paper is a continuation of our previous work @xcite . here , we are concerned with noiseless systems . in our earlier work ,<n> we considered the case where the system of interest is stochastically driven by a hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is a  noisy '' version of hamilton s hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation . for this<n> , it is sufficient to consider the system to be  noiseless '' , i.e. , there is no interaction between the system and the environment . however , in the presence of noise , the system s behavior can not be described by any  classical '' model . instead , one needs to consider  quantum '' models , where the environment is modeled by a quantum mechanical system , such as a particle in in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the state of a quantum system which is subject to noise and noiseless measurements .<n> we derive a condition which states the achievability of accurate estimation for the noiseless system . as an application of this condition ,<n> we show that the error in the estimation of a noiseless quantum system is at most @xmath0 . <n> estimation of physical observables in quantum systems is one of the most important problems in quantum information theory @xcite . in this problem<n> , one aims to estimate the value of an observable given a set of values for some parameter of the system , such as the energy or the position of the observable . for a given value of the parameter , the estimation problem is np - hard in general . on the other hand , for a class of observables , called _ bell s _ states , which are the maximal states of a collection of quantum systems , it is possible to find approximate solutions to the same estimation problem , even in the presence of noise and/or measurement errors , provided that the system is noiseless and the parameter values are small . to estimate a system s in this paper , we study the estimation problem of a group testing scheme .<n> the group testing problem is modeled as the joint reconstruction of a low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) code and a noiseless system . for this problem ,<n> we will derive the achievability conditions for achieving arbitrarily small estimation error probabilities . as an application of these results<n> , it will be shown that the estimation error probability of the grouptesting scheme can be made arbitrarily small by a sharp threshold , which is similar to the shannon limit for a channel coding problem . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of estimating the joint state of a finite set of subsystems plays an important role in various areas of information - theoretic engineering @xcite . among them , the estimation of the state is of particular interest , since it can be used as the input of a reconstruction algorithm for the reconstruction of some physical system , e.g. , a binary symmetric channel . on the other hand , estimation error is an important component of the information theoretic construction of a good channel coding scheme , because it is the main source of the channel coding error probability . in this work we prove lower bounds on the estimation error probability in a highly incomplete group testing scheme .<n> the lower bounds imply that a sparse pooling graph or pooling matrix is required for asymptotically optimal reconstruction , which implies that a good linear error correction scheme requires a dense parity check matrix . in the same way<n> that the shannon limit has been used as a benchmark for the combination of a code and a decoding algorithm , these results can provide a concrete benchmark for existing and emerging reconstruction algorithms , such as belief propagation , and can stimulate the development of novel reconstruction methods .",

[<n> [ section ] ] one of the most important problems in the study of galaxy formation and evolution is the nature of the radiative feedback which takes place between the formation of stars and baryons and between galaxies and their environment . the standard paradigm for galaxy formation is based on the idea of adiabatic contraction of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe , followed by a period of rapid , inhomogeneous contraction , during which the cdm dark matter halos accrete and grow in mass , as @x we show that the uv luminosity function at any redshift can be estimated from the luminosity evolution of individual galaxies in the early universe .<n> this result is based on models of galaxy formation in dark matter halos , and their evolution in the presence of radiative feedback in ionized regions of the universe , which are self - consistently calculated from cosmological n - body simulations . at redshifts @xmath0 ,<n> the number density of uv bright galaxies grows exponentially with time , while the number of fainter galaxies decreases , in agreement with the predictions of hierarchical structure formation models which predict that galaxies with bright luminosities evolve more slowly than their fainter counterparts . <n> the evolution of star formation activity in the universe has been a topic of intense research for several decades . in the last decade<n> , significant progress has been made , both observationally and theoretically , to understand the star formation history in the local universe ( see , for example , best et al . 2006 ; also dijkstra et al<n> . 2002 ) . however , it is not clear how the process of galaxy evolution is related to the underlying structure formation history . to this end , we present a series of models for the evolution of the uv luminosity function of galaxies in the @xmath0cdm paradigm .<n> we explore a wide range of cosmological parameters to fit the observed luminosity function at different redshifts . in all models , we find that the number density of galaxies at any given redshift is limited by the amount of reionization of the universe , and by agn feedback in the early universe . <n> galaxies : evolution cosmology : theory large - scale structure of universe radiative transfer of energy through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite . at low redshift ,<n> the energy density in the igm is dominated by the cosmic uv background ( uvb ) , while at high redshift it is primarily the reprocessing of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by the intergalactic electrons . as a result , the uvb is the main driver of galaxy formation in the low mass end of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and the cmbr dominates the lf at the high mass end . however , it is not the only factor that determines galaxy evolution . we study the abundance and properties of high redshift ( @xmath0 ) type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , using a large grid of cosmological simulations .<n> we focus on three models : ( 1 ) the standard cold dark matter ( hereafter ps ) model , ( 2 ) a ps model with molecular cooled halos , and ( 3 ) molecular cooled models with the standard stellar ( hereafter st ) mass function . in all models , we find that the abundance of molecular cooled objects is much higher than that of the ps objects , though the latter have a much lower reionization history compared to the st objects . we also find that models with st and other mass functions predict slightly different abundance of high mass collapsed halos compared to models using the standard ps mass function though they do not differ greatly amongst themselves . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory galaxies : formation supernovae : general .2 in [ [ section ] ] one of the most intriguing results from the sloan digital sky survey is the discovery of a large number of faint , high -

models , as well as the sasaki formalism of structure formation . for comparison , in paper ii we also considered the ps mass function and we found that the we present a model for the formation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from the accretion of dark matter ( dm ) halos with masses in the range of @xmath0@xmath1 .<n> the model is based on the idea that the igm volume filling factor is dominated by the galactic outflows from these halos . in our model<n> the dm halos are assumed to follow a power - law mass function , which we call the pseudo - stellar ( ps ) mass function ( hereafter called the ps mass function for short ) , as well as a sasaki formalism for the evolution of the universe . <n> we calculate the porosity of the porosity distribution of the galactic halos at a given epoch in the universe and then calculate the uv luminosity function of igm as a function of redshift . to our knowledge<n> this is the first attempt to calculate the i gm luminosity function using a model which is consistent with all the observational constraints , including the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) at high redshifts , using a self -

analytical models with those of the sasaki formalism , and with the derivative of different mass functions . we find that the ps mass function predicts higher volume filling factor even if the uv luminosity function predicted by them were same . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory dark matter , galaxies : formation , evolution , structure we investigate the physical properties of outflows predicted by different models of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) .<n> we show that the mass function predicted by the standard model ( sm ) of the bao , the so - called st mass function , predicts more massive halos at higher redshifts , and that it also predicts more outflows compared to the sasaki formalism of the parametric bao ( pbao ) which is based on the fact that the sm predicts more compact objects . in order to explain the large number of observed outflows at @xmath0 , we propose that the baryonic bao is produced by the outflows of dark matter ( dm ) halos that were formed at higher @xcite at the beginning of the universe s evolution . <n> dark matter is the main constituent of galaxies and it is the dominant component of baryons in the universe today . as a result<n> , it is expected that a large fraction of the total baryon content was produced in the early universe and that the first generation of stars were formed in dark matter halos . since dark matter can not be directly detected , most of the observed baryon in paper iii of this series , we have discussed models of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at @xmath0 based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies . in this paper<n> we focus on models of outflows from the cdm driven by density perturbations .<n> we show that the physical properties related to these outflows do not differ significantly between different models , even if the volume filling factor of the igm changes ( up to 50% ) depending on the way we calculate the net formation rate ( upto 50% change ) . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation cosmology : theory dark matter <n> ism : intergalactic medium . here<n> we present models of supernova ( sn ) driven outflows ( wind ) from cdm dominated proto -

analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies that are constrained by available observations on uv luminosity function and reionization . our models successfully explained the observed uv luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies at @xmath0 and predicted various effects of outflows form the galaxies on the metal enrichment of the igm . here<n> we present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass functions .<n> further , two methods are normally used in the literature to compute the net formation rate of halos for the ps mass function ; ( i ) the formalism of sasaki is used to calculate a formation rate for halos at collapse and then fold in the halo survival probability to later epochs , or ( ii ] the derivative of the px mass function is employed to get a net formation rates ( formation rate minus destruction rate ) at any redshift . in all these models one of the main ingredients is the mass function of the galaxy halos . however the halo masses determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation differ considerably from the standard ps masses , especially for we show that the historically used press - schechter mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function . therefore , significant differences can arise in model predictions made using the ps mass function and the other forms of the mass functions considered here .<n> we show the effect of this difference by ( i ) calculating the reionization history of the universe , ( ii ) fitting the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs , and ( iii ) determining the feedback of star formation on the igm . we present new sets of uv luminosity functions of luminous blue galaxies ( lbgs ) at different redshifts .<n> we extend our earlier models , which used the sasaki formalism to determine the uv luminosity function of lbgs at @xmath0 , to the faint end and to higher redshift , and show that the models using st and other mass functions , obtained from simulations , provide a better fit to the observed luminosity functions in the redshift range . by using the @math0 minimization technique ,<n> we show that models with the st halo mass function provide a good fit to all the data sets used , but the models differ more and more strongly as one goes to higher and higher red shifts . <n> the reionization , the efficiency in the star formation and/or in uv escape fraction , has to be lower in the models with st andother mass functions compared to that with the ps mass function . in the framework of earlier models<n> , we have shown that molecular cooled halos in the igm have a net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos which is lower than that predicted by the  standard model '' ( sm ) of baryons and electrons in paper ii of this series , we have presented a @xmath0 analysis of the uv luminosity functions at high redshifts . in this paper<n> we do a similar analysis at low redshift .<n> we find that the data at low and intermediate redshift are in good agreement with each other and with the results of paper ii . at the same time , our analysis at the high - redshift end of the data set shows that the number density of outflows is much higher than that predicted by the sasaki theory of galaxy formation . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : intergalactic medium -

[ cor : non - triviality ] <n> ( ii ) we will recall the definition of a _ fundamental in @xcite , it was shown that the automorphism group of the symmetric group @xmath0 is finitely generated if and only if there is at least one _ fundamental flat _ , that is , a disjoint subset of the fundamental group . in this paper , we show that if there are at least two fundamental flats of a symmetric group , then the deletions of these flats are also connected .<n> we give an example of a _ spanning circuit _ of a matroid , which is a generalization of the well - known _ nested matroids _ ( generalized catalan ) , and use this example to show that there is a spanning circuit of a catalan matroid having a pnc - flat . <n> the notion of a fundamental flat is fundamental to the theory of automorphism groups ( see , for instance , the introduction of the term  fundamental flat '' in ref.@xcite and references therein ) and to the study of _ symmetric group automorphisms_. it is well known that a symmetric ( or , more generally , symmetric ) group is _ finite _ if it has a finite sum of fundamental flats we prove a number of results about matroids in @xmath0 whose fundamental flats form a chain . in particular , we prove the following : 1 . <n> a connected matroid in the projective plane is _ nested _ if and only if its fundamental flats are the set complements of the fundamental flats of the class of _ parallel extensions _ of the matroid .<n> 2 . a connected connected ( but not necessarily loopless ) matroid is a _ paving _ matroid whose only pnc - flats are two disjoint circuit - hyperplanes whose union is the ground set . the notion of a paving matroid<n> was introduced by andruskisei @xcite for the purpose of understanding the geometry of the planar quantum circuits whose path order is given by a matroid presentation . as a special case of this general idea ,<n> we introduce and study a new concept , _ path order _ , which is a natural generalization of the classical order . for a connected quantum circuit in a planar setting , the following are some of the basic properties of its matroid class : ( 1 ) the fundamental flat of any matroid of rank @x we give a complete characterization of the matroid minors of @xmath0 .<n> in particular , we prove that there are no excluded minors of matroids with minors in the following sense : for each matroid @xcite , there is an excluded minor of at most one other matroid ; furthermore , the free extension and coextension of a matroid by a parallel connection of the parallel extension at two different points are excluded as well . <n> a _<n> fundamental _ property of a topological space is its _ coextension _ or _ free extension _ , which is defined as the distance between two points on the boundary of the space . for a general class of topological spaces ,<n> the coextension or free extension can be defined in several ways : ( 1 ) by basepoint , ( 2 ) as a product , or ( 3 ) via a certain _ parallel connection_. in the case of topological space , parallel connections are an important tool ; for example , it is known that the minors of all connected minors are in the space of all parallel connections . in this paper<n> we show that the parallel connection property is a fundamental we give a complete characterization of the minors of @xmath0 for matroids of rank at least five . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] minors of abelian groups are defined as those groups whose automorphism group is isomorphic to the affine space of homogeneous groups @xcite .<n> their definition is as follows : a _ group _ is _omorphic _ to a homogeneous group if it is a subgroup of a group , and an _ affines _ subgroup is the set of all non - trivial hyperplanes of the group that are not in any nontrivial hyperplane . in the case<n> that the group is the symmetric group ( i.e. , the product of two homogeneous groups ) , minors of any group are called _<n> excluded minors_. in this sense , an excluded minor is a member of an excluded group only if it _ does _ not _ appear in any other group ; in other words , any two excluded minors are _ the only _ ones . the notion of excluded minors was introduced by abel , dehorn , lefschetz , lifshitz  let @xmath0 be a finite direct - sum product of finitely many copies of an irreducible and trivial linear algebra .<n> we prove that the matroids of excluded minors of @xcite are connected and that the fundamental flats of the finite direct sum of copies of this algebra are its single - element deletions and contractions . we show that the fundamental flats of the parallel extension of the @xmath0-torus are not necessarily the same as those of its single - element deletions and contractions . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an upper bound on the number of transversal matroids that can be used to construct minors whose parallel extension has a finite fundamental flat . <n> the notion of fundamental flats was introduced by john von neumann in his celebrated work @xcite .<n> they are natural generalizations of flats that are invariant under the action of a finite - dimensional operator . in particular , they are fundamental in the sense that they do not depend on the particular choice of the finite dimensional operator but only on the set of all finite dimensional operators that are allowed to be deleted and contractions in the fundamental flat of the extension . while the definition of a fundamental flat is not unique , it is easy to show that it is a sufficient condition for a certain class of minors to have a finite number of mutually fundamental flats . for instance , there are minors whose fundamental flats are three or more times those of their single - elements deletions or contractions , which are the only excluded minors having such a property , see e.g. @ let @xmath0 be a nontrivial connected matroid of positive rank .<n> we prove that there is a finitely many nontrivial parallel connections between arbitrary connected nodes in @xcite . <n> the notion of a _ parallel connection _ of a matroid was introduced by thurston in his study of the _ cayley graph_.<n> it is a graph whose vertices are all connected and whose edges are all parallel to each other , so that each edge of the graph can be viewed as a terminal node of a connected node in the graph . in his seminal monograph , thurton showed that there are at most two ways to construct a  parallel connection '' : first , by cutting the edge at the parallel connection and inserting the edge immediately after the connection ; second , via a construction that he called _ spanning_. in this note<n> , we consider the second kind of spanning , namely , the construction of an interval presentation of the parallel extension of the matroid by a finite number of parallel connections . for a given matroid ,<n> we show that there exists an infinite family of matroids with a finite set of parallel extensions , and an infinite let @xmath0 be a connected matroid of positive rank .<n> we prove that , among all matroids @xcite with nontrivial parallel connections , there is only one connected one with a terminal that is not supported by an open chain of fundamental flats . <n> [ section ] [ theorem ] proposition [ prop : lemma ] introduction.2 ] the purpose of this paper is to prove , for all connected , nontrivial , matroid , in a certain sense , a conjecture of sergei _<n> et al_. , phys . rev . lett . * 105 * , 190401 ( 2010 ) . in this paper<n> , we consider the following question : given an open matroid ( a connected multiterminal matroid with no terminal ) in @ x , what is its set of terminal elements ?<n> the answer to this question is as follows . given an answer to the question above ,<n> what is the set of elements of the matroid that are not terminal ? <n> _ suppose the following is true : ( a ) there is a matroid in @x we study the minimal minors of @xmath0 .<n> we show that , among all minors of this type , only one is a matroid , one of the matroids in figure [ r3etc2 ] , and the other is a spanning circuit . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]proposition the following problem was considered by two of the present authors : ( a ) what is the minimal minor of a chain of fundamental flats ? <n> ( b ) how does the minimality of the fundamental flats affect the length of the chains ?<n> the answer to the first question is well - known . in [ cor : keepch ]<n> , it was shown that the minimal length of a fundamental flats chain is the same for all minors except one , which is not the case for the second question . for the third question ,<n> it was proved by shapiro and schiffler , but not by them ; here we give a new proof . as a corollary of our main result , we obtain a new characterization of the minimal fundamental flats of the following minors : [ a ] let @xmath0 be an irreducible finite set of size two .<n> we show that the minimal set of cardinality at least two is not a line . <n> introduction the notion of a minimal set ( ms ) was introduced by john von neumann in his celebrated paper @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider ms sets that are minimal in the following sense : the cardinality of the fundamental flat of the set is minimal among all fundamental flats of the given set , and the set has no other fundamental flats that are comparable to the set s fundamental flats . as a consequence ,<n> ms is independent of the dimension of its fundamental flats and is not necessarily minimal in dimension two ; in fact , it is always minimal , even when the fundamental flats are not comparable , as is shown in figure [ fig : r3etc2 ] . the ms set is the set of all finite sets of size at most two with the following properties : ( a ) there is an infinite number of finite sets with cardinality less than two , ( b ) it is finitely presented in the sense of spanning circuits ; ( c  we show that there is a spanning circuit @xmath0 of the fundamental flat of a non - uniform nested matroid . <n> the notion of a fundamental flat ( ff ) was introduced by john von neumann in his celebrated work @xcite .<n> a ff is a hyperplane that is the smallest fundamental flat that contains the least ( resp . greatest ) element of the hyperplane . in the case of hyperplanes ,<n> ffs have been studied by many researchers , including bohr , smoluchowski , and others ( see e.g. refs . and references therein ) . a fundamental hyperplane is called fundamental if it is the only fundamental flat in which all its elements are contained in the least one . the concept of an ff was first introduced by thurston in his proof of heisenberg s uncertainty principle , which states that , for any finite number of fundamental flats , there is an upper bound on the minimal number of elements of the flat that can be contained in any one element . for a hypersurface , a fundamental ff<n> is said to be minimal if all its fundamental flats are comparable  we prove that there are only two pnc - flats @xmath0 , and both are circuits : the first is a spanning circuit , the second is a line with four points .<n> we also show that the minimal spanning circuit of the first flat is uniform . <n> the notion of a pnc is introduced in @xcite , where it is shown that the set of all pnc flats is finite . in this<n> setting , pnc flatness is defined as the property that the only flats of a given set are uniform nested matroids ; in this context , matroid flatness was introduced by s. srensen in his proof of the uniform flatness of the real line , which is based on the fact that all matroid flats of the line are uniform ; here , non - uniform matroid - flats are defined as those sets that are uniform in the following sense : every matroid is the union of two nested circuits . as a consequence ,<n> any flat can be decomposed into a uniform set , with each uniform set being the minimal flat of the set ; the uniform set is called the pnc . for a flat , it is we consider the problem of characterizing the minimal connectivity of a @xmath0-node quantum circuit .<n> we show that the minimality condition for a single - qubit gate can be reduced to the following : ( 1 ) the following is not equivalent . <n> ( 2 ) if the quantum circuit can be decomposed as a sum of two nonspanning circuits , then it is not minimal in the sense that any parallel connection using the two circuits as the basepoint has , in the first case , a nonspanning minor of the order of the fundamental flat of the two - circuit - hyperplane . in the second case<n> , there is a nontrivial , nonminimality condition on the circuits that is necessary and sufficient to guarantee that the sum of the minimalities of the circuits is minimal ; in particular , this condition is the same as minimality of a line in the fundamental plane . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain that the number of qubits required to perform a universal quantum computation is bounded above by the minimal number of gates required to make a universal gate with a given set of minimality conditions . the characterization of minimal connectivity @xcite is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory . we consider the problem of finding the minimal connectivity @xmath0 , in terms of the lyapunov exponents , required for a quantum computer to function .<n> we prove that the minimum connectivity is @xcite . <n> quantum computers are not perfect , but they can be fault - tolerant , at least in principle . in order to prove such a property ,<n> it is necessary to show that a generic quantum computer has a minimal connectivity . to this end<n> , it is natural to ask , what is the minimum possible connectivity ?<n> the natural answer to this question is , of course , that the maximum possible connectivity is the one given by shannon s inequality , which states that no quantum computer can process more than one copy of a classical computer s output without causing the computer to be error - free . as is well known , this inequality is false for classical computers , and it is also false for quantum computers . however , there is a class of quantum computers for which this inequality does not hold , the so - called fault - tolerance quantum computers ( ftqcs ) . a ftqc is a quantum version of the classical fault - we show that a fundamental flat of a matroid is either a loop or a loop - free isthmus of the matroid , and we describe all such matroids that are fundamental flats . <n> [ theorem]corollary we prove , for any matroid @xmath0 , that there is a unique matroid whose fundamental flat is , up to isomorphism , a pnc - flat .<n> this is in contrast to the fact that , in [ cor : notlpm ] , it is proved that any fundamental flat for a connected matroid can be realized as a loop , which is not the case for flats of general matoids . as a corollary<n> , we prove that if a general matroid has a fundamental - flat structure , then it has a unique fundamental flat that is not a loop of the underlying matroid or deletion . for the proof ,<n> we introduce a new notion , _ fundamental flatness _ , defined as the number of positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of the values of all fundamental flates of a given matroid ( see theorems [ lem : ff1 ] in this paper , we show that if @xmath0 is a reducible intersection of two finitely connected pnc - flats , then the intersection of the two flats is always connected .<n> more precisely , the following is shown . <n> 1 . for a reducibility condition on a flat , it is well - known that its intersection is always a connected component of itself . however , if the condition is not satisfied , there is no connection between the two intersections . in this work ,<n> we show this is not the case . we prove that for a given condition , every reducability condition is equivalent to the following three conditions : [ lem : staycon ] for the first two conditions , let @xcite be the set of all reduccible intersections of finitely many riemann - hilbert ( r - h ) flats of a given dimension . then for each reducosity @x<n> , consider the intersection @x , which is the intersection between the reduccessing flats @ x and y , and the set , denoted by _<n> t _ , of all non - zero reduc we characterize the set of @xmath0-parametrized hamiltonians for which there is a spanning circuit connecting two irreducible pnc - flats . <n> the hamiltonian of a pnc flat is the union of finitely many planar curves .<n> a flat is a curve that is reducible in both pncs , so its intersection with another flat is called the pncflat . in this paper<n> , we consider the following set of pnc flats : the intersection of two planar curves in which the first and second are pnc , the second and third are irreducibility flats , and the last two are fundamental flats ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . for each set of flat ,<n> we define a _ spanning circuit _ , which is a basis of the intersection and is invariant under taking curves in the intersection , see for example , refs . [ lem : prep ] and [ cor : irr ] in the references . here<n> we prove the following : if there is no spanning circuit in a reducibility - reducible set , we show that the @xmath0-dimensional riemannian metric on the complex projective line can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible pnc - flat and fundamental flat components .<n> we give examples of such decompositions in the context of projective geometry . <n> = 1 the projective space is a manifold in which every finite dimensional manifold is isometric to a euclidean space . in this paper<n> , we consider decompositions of this space into finite dimensional subspaces . for each such subspace ,<n> we may define a flat metric , which we may call a _ fundamental flat _ , on the space of the decompositions , and show that it is in one - to - one correspondence with the corresponding flat metric in the euclidian space , provided the decomposition preserves the structure of the underlying manifold . the purpose of this paper is to show that each such decomposition is equivalent to a sum over irreducibility classes in the sense that each class contains a fundamental flat of the other . we prove that a matroid in @xmath0 with no @xcite , no pnc - flat , and no p nc - singleton has at least three fundamental flats . <n> [ theorem]lemma [ theorem ] proposition [ theorem)corollary [ theorem],conjecture the following question is posed : given three matroids in @ x , what is the smallest matroid that can be embedded in them ?<n> the answer to this question is as follows .<n> given three disjoint irreducible matrices , which are the product of disjoint matroid sets , one can associate a pnc flat to each of the matrices and , therefore , a fundamental flat of each matroid set . here<n> , we will assume that the three matrices are disjoint , that is , the matrices are in bijection with the fundamental flats of the other matrices . for each matrix ,<n> we will denote the set of matrices it contains ; for the remaining matrix we will call its _ matroid _ , in which case we will see that it is possible to prove that the matroid is embedded in it . in this paper<n> we consider the following we prove that @xmath0 is the unique irreducible representation of a circuit on the real line , up to isomorphism .<n> we also prove that the irreducibility is preserved under local operations and classical communication . <n> let @xcite be a circuit with @x , _<n> i.e. _ , the number of non - zero eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix of the state of the circuit . in this paper<n> , we consider circuits with up to three eigenstates , or , more generally , circuits with arbitrary number of states . here<n> we deal with the case when the reduced densities of states of the circuits are real , that is , when they are not integer multiples of one another . for an example of this , see refs . [<n> s : circuit ] and [ cor : eigenstate ] , respectively . a circuit is said to be unique if it can be uniquely determined from the properties of all of its states ; in other words , if it is unique , then its properties are completely determined by its state of each of the states  we prove that the smallest fundamental flat in @xmath0 is a hyperplane , and we construct a counterexample to a recent claim that smallest fundamental flats are not hyperplanes .<n> we also show that the conjecture is false if the smallest hyperplane is replaced by any other . <n> [ theorem]corollary it is well - known that the set of all riemann surfaces of dimension at least two is not finite . in this paper<n> , we prove a stronger statement : there are only finitely many irreducible hyperplane - subspaces of the _ complete _ hypersurfaces of dimension two . as a consequence ,<n> we show that any finite set of _ all _ fundamental flats of a complete hypersurface of dimension 2 is a subset of at least three hyperplane subspace , which is a surprising result in view of the known finiteness of all fundamental flats , as well as the fact that all hyperplane flats are , in fact , complete . in this paper , we show that the set of all uniform matroids is not finite .<n> in fact , for any finite matroid @xmath0 , there is a unique matroid , which we call a chain , that is , a finite set of uniform matsroids that is not contained in any finite fundamental flat . <n> the notion of a matroid was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in his proof of the celebrated , and still widely used , thurston s theorem . in this<n> setting , it is natural to ask whether a given matroid is finite , or whether , more generally , if a given set of _ all _ uniform matoids is infinite . to answer this question ,<n> it is important to understand the structure of the matroid set , in particular , whether it is finite or not . for a given , non - zero , matroid<n> , the following is shown : ( i ) the set ( ii ) of all matoids , is finite if and only if it is the union of all finite sets ; ( iii ) there is an integer we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between hyperplanes and spanning circuits in the three - dimensional euclidean space .<n> we also show that this correspondence is equivalent to the well - known lloyd correspondence . <n> [ theorem]corollary we prove that the set of all eigenvalues of a dirac operator @xmath0 is a closed subset of the real line . as a consequence<n> , there is an eigenvalue corresponding to each dirac point in the dirac equation ; this eigen value is unique up to isomorphism and is not determined by the position of the eigenvectors . in the case of dirac s equation ,<n> this unique dirac value is called the _ dimension _ of the system ; see @xcite and the references therein for a complete list of all dirac operators . for a system in the euclidian space , the dimension of its eigenspace<n> is defined as the number of its fundamental flats , or equivalently , its dimension , which is the minimal number of flats required to describe the system in its dirac spectrum ; for a general system , this number is the we show that the disjoint union of two disjoint fundamental flats is not disjoint .<n> this is true even if they are disjoint in the sense that their union is incomparable , i.e. , contains all elements except the two fundamental flats . as a corollary<n> , we obtain that the set of all states of a quantum system with maximally entangled states is finite . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / [ [ definition]]*theorem * + + [ [ theorem]*lemma * + [ + / definition]*corollary * + we prove that the lpmchar - selberg model of the real line is a pnc - flat of the line .<n> we also give a new proof of the fact that the @xmath0 sachs transform of the gaussian curvature field is a real - valued function of the curvature field . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]corollary this paper is concerned with the model of a real line , or , more generally , with the behavior of its curvature as a function of its dimension . in section [ thm]conjecture<n> it is assumed that the curvature of the field is real and positive , and that the properties in proposition [ prop : lpm char ] are satisfied . here<n> we show that this assumption is not necessarily true : we give a counter - example showing that the model is in fact not real . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new characterization of the model , one that is more general than the one given by prop .

phase , whose properties are very different from those of a conventional phase . for a long time<n> , it has been believed that meta - phases are absent in nature , but it has recently been recognized that they may exist in some materials . among the meta - materials , <n> the so - called composite metamaterials ( cms ) are of particular interest because they exhibit a large variety of physical properties , such as we report a coupled - fano analysis of the @xmath0o(@xmath1 ) decay of the double - charged kagome molecule , _ s_-h2o(barc)2$ ] , which is one of the most promising candidates to be a kagom insulator .<n> we measured extinction and absorption spectra of the molecule and found that its extinction spectrum is deconvoluted to 2 lorentzian resonances , while its absorption spectrum is composed of double fano resonances which take part in giving rise to a large oscillator strength stretching from 1.8thz to 3.0thz . <n> kagoma insulator ( ki ) is a widely studied material because of its peculiar electronic and magnetic properties such as the large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite , high critical current ( dc ) , and high critical temperature ( ht)@xcite as well as its potential role in quantum information processing . in spite of its importance ,<n> it has been a controversial issue whether or not the molecule can be considered as a topological insulator ( ti ) since it is believed that the existence of ti is not we have measured the frequency - dependent absorption spectrum of @xmath0si@xmath1 in an external electric field .<n> we find that the spectrum is deconvoluted to two lorentzian resonances , indicating that the system is composed of a strongly driven and a weakly driven dipolar oscillators with the two interacting by a near - field coupling . as a result<n> , the entire spectrum is contained under the envelope of the linear absorption spectrum . <n> the dipolar interaction in solid - state physics is one of the most fundamental phenomena in solid state physics . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ,<n> the oscillators are driven by the quantized electromagnetic field , and the interaction between them is called dipolar coupling ( dlc ) @xcite . due to the importance of the dlc in qcd , there has been a great deal of theoretical and experimental efforts to study it . among them , in ref.@xcite a novel type of dlc has been proposed , where a quantum two - level system is driven by a quantized electric field and exhibits a non - adiabatic behavior . however , it is still an open question whether the we report on the observation of an asymmetric fano lineshape in the terahertz ( thz ) frequency range .<n> the fano resonances are located at 1.6thz and 2.4thz in the spectrum of the composite metamaterial , where double - fano resonators ( dsrrs ) and frr resonators are used as the reference systems , and the external drive is applied to the subradiant oscillator . the asymmetric lineshape is caused by the coherent coupling between a pair of superradiant dipoles and a dipole in frr , even when the externally driven subradiants are present . <n> recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the development of photonic crystals based on composite metamaterials @xcite . in these materials ,<n> the composite structure plays an important role , since it can be used as a metamaterial with various interesting physical properties . among them , it is known to be a promising material for quantum information processing , owing to its low - threshold , high - quality factor , long coherence time , low material complexity , as well as the fact that it is a stable metamaterial even when an external driving is applied @x the control of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , which is a fundamental quantum phenomenon , has been demonstrated in a tripod atomic system and in a single metal nanoparticle system .<n> however , control of eit in a solid - state system is still an open problem . here<n> , we propose the use of near - field couplings between two superradiant oscillators and a subradiant dipole in a double fano resonance ( frr ) resonator in a composite metamaterial to control the absorption spectrum of one superradiance oscillator . in a @xmath0 mm@xmath1 composite metamaterials ,<n> we show that there is an interplay between the superradiants and subradiants through couplings with near - fields , and that the power spectrum of the two oscillators can be controlled by tuning the powers of the zeeman eit signal . <n> control of optical and microwave fields is essential for many applications@xcite . for example , in microwave field control , one can manipulate the direction and strength of the microwave field by changing the polarization of an incident incident photon , or change the frequency of a microwave pulse by controlling the microwave polarization of a normally incident @ we demonstrate a method to control the absorbed power spectrum of a superradiant and a subradiant oscillator in a system composed of two independent orthogonal dipoles .<n> the control is achieved by coupling the two dipoles to a common subradiance oscillator . through the coupling @xmath0<n> , we show that the control of the absorbed powers of the two independent dipoles can be controlled by tuning the power of the common dipole . <n> control over the absorption of light is an important ingredient in many areas of modern science and technology@xcite . in quantum optics , for example ,<n> the optical control of light propagation is a key ingredient for the realization of quantum information processing @xcite<n> . however , it is not possible to directly control the absorption spectrum of light due to the strong couplings between the light field and the matter it interacts with . instead , the control can be achieved via the coupling of the light to other degrees of freedom , such as other oscillators , or via electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in a tripod atomic system . here<n> we report on a novel method for control of absorbed power of two superradiance ( srr ) oscillators in we report the observation of near - field couplings between isolated lorentzian and coupled dipoles in far - field resonant cavities ( frr ) in @xmath0al@xmath1mno@xcite . by measuring the extinction spectra of the frr cavities ,<n> we show that the coupling strength between isolated dipoles is much smaller than that between coupled ones .<n> we also measure the spectra of absorbed power of the isolated oscillators , and find that they are subradiant , suggesting that the dipoles are not only isolated but also coupled . <n> the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite is one of the most fundamental interactions in nature . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed )<n> , it is essential to understand the interaction between light and matter , which leads to the discovery of superconductivity and superfluidity in the late 70 s . due to the strong coupling between the light field and the matter field , the spectrum of electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) is known to be extremely sensitive to the light - matter interaction . on the other hand , in the past few years , a new field of cavity qed has been established , the fano effect , i.e. , the resonant enhancement of the absorbed powers of a collection of oscillators , has been a subject of intense study . in this work ,<n> we report the observation of the characteristic asymmetric fano resonances in the near - field couplings between the superradiant oscillators of discrete spin resonance ( dsrr ) and the subradiant dipoles of ferromagnetic resonance ( frr ) .<n> these results are expected to be useful in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices based on frrs . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + +++ + + -

enhanced precision measurements . however , to date there is no plasmonic double fano resonances ( fdr s ) in tripod plasmon resonances can be used as efficient nonlinear optical parametric oscillators . in this work ,<n> we show that two fdrs with different spectral positions can be coupled in a way determined by the relative spectral positions of the two superradiant resonances with respect to the common subradiant mode .<n> this phenomenon can be observed in a wide range of plasmic resonances , and can be useful for the development of efficient nonlinear optics with superradiance . <n> nonlinear optical phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology . for example , the fano effect @xcite , in which the phase of a nonlinear optical wave is negative , is one of the most important nonlinear phenomena in nature . due to its fundamental importance in nonlinear optics<n> , there has been a great deal of work on the creation and characterization of nonlinear optical effects , especially in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) , which is a branch of modern physics that deals with the interaction of light and matter at the fundamental level . despite the great progress in the past , it has not yet been possible to we study the phase evolution of single - mode lorentzian oscillators in the presence of near - field couplings to superradiant and subradiant modes .<n> we find that the phase of a single isolated dipole exhibits a dip , a feature characteristic of a fano resonance , when it comes across the resonance of a subradiance , while the phase and amplitude of isolated dipoles show no such dip . as a result ,<n> the amplitude and phase of dipoles can be tuned by passing the resonances of single subradiants . <n> _ introduction. _ radiative transfer in quantum mechanics is often described in terms of the fano equation @xcite , which states that a quantum system can be driven by a driving force that is proportional to the number of its excitations @xmath0 . in the context of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , fano s equation is equivalent to the kramers - kronig relation , in which the driving force is given by the hamiltonian of the system , i.e. , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) massless dirac equation , and the system is described by a 1 we study the phase evolution of single and double fano resonances in plasmonic structures using the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group method .<n> we find that the phase of a subradiant when it comes across the resonance of a superradiant which has additional phase shifts is located below and above its own resonance when coupled to the other dipole which has the additional phase shift . in single fano<n> resonances , we show that the absorption of powers by the coupled dipoles is always positive - definite , and that the sum of areas under red , blue , or green curves is the same as the extinction spectra of mm@xmath0 when a single resonance takes place . that is , the absorption spectra of @xmath1 are identical to the extinction spectrum of mm , @xcite which is observed in fano resonant plasmon structures . when two dipoles are coupled to each other , however , their absorption powers are always negative - definite and their extinction spectra are similar to that of mm when single resonances take place , but the absorption powers of two subradiants when they come across each other dip in their own resonances and then they come back to the same plasmonic fano resonances are widely used to study the interaction between light and matter . in this work ,<n> we show that double fano resonant interaction can be realized in plasmon - polariton structures , where two dipoles are coupled to a common subradiant .<n> we find that the phase of the coupled dipoles can be pulled down sharply near the resonance of the subradiance , which leads to a delay in recovering back to its original value , when compared with what happens in a single resonance . as a result , the spectral position of amplitude maximum at the low frequency is red - shifted to a frequency below the resonances of the superradiant dipoles . <n> the interaction of light with matter is ubiquitous in nature@xcite and has been studied in various fields of physics , such as condensed - matter systems@xmath0cold atoms in an optical lattice , atomic ensembles , and light - matter interaction in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems@ xcite . for example , in the fano - bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of polaritons , polariton - phonon interaction leads to the formation of a superfluid@x we report the observation of coherent effects in double fano resonances in a tripod metamaterial system .<n> the extinction spectra show up as an energy transfer from low - energy @xmath0 oscillator to a common subradiant oscillator , resulting in a wide fano dip wider than that in a single fano resonant in region . in the region , on the other hand , enhancement and blue - shift of extinction in the superradiant dipole is mainly due to a delay in phase recovery of dipole . <n> [ [ introduction.- ] ] introduction.+ + + ++ + - + +<n> + + the fano effect @xcite is one of the most fundamental phenomena in electrodynamics and has been extensively studied in a large variety of systems , ranging from solid - state to condensed - matter systems . recently<n> , it has been observed in metamaterials and photonic crystals @x<n> . however , the origin of fano effects is still an open question . here , we report a new type of coherent effect in a metamaterial , namely , fano - assisted coherent energy transfer , which takes place in a near - field coupling of two oscillators , one of which we report on the existence of double fano resonances in a tripod metamaterial system , which is realized by using a layered metamaterial composed of a dielectric material with a double - well - defined resonance and a dielectric substrate .<n> we find that near - field couplings of two superradiant oscillators , @xmath0 , in the dielectric material , and a subradiant oscillation , , to a common oscillator in the substrate give rise to a fano dip wider than that in a single resonance in region . in the extinction spectra of the composite metamaterial , these coherent effects show up as an energy transfer from low - energy oscillator to high - energy one . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , there has been a great deal of interest in using metamaterials as building blocks in photonic circuits @xcite . among various metamaterial systems , tripod metamaterials<n> have attracted particular attention because of their unique properties , such as double - fano ( dsrr ) resonances . here<n> , we show for the first time that a double dsr resonance can be realized in a metamaterial with a tripod structure , even though it is a single - well we report on the plamonic excitations in a composite metamaterial , which is composed of a planar metamaterial and a dielectric material .<n> we find that double fano resonances are excited by coherent coupling between the two metamaterial components , and the subradiant mode is excited by dipole - dipole interaction between the dielectric metamaterial ( dsrr ) and the dielectric material ( frr ) , in contrast to the results reported in ref . <n> @xcite , where a single dipolar resonance is coupled two dipoles placed side - by - side . using a first - principles simulation ,<n> we show that the plasmonic coupling in the composite metamaterials is multipolar , similar to the multipolar coupling in planar metamaterials such as tio@xmath0-type metamaterials . in dielectric metamaterials<n> , it has been shown that the coupling between different dielectrics can be controlled by applying an electric field , such as the electric dipole moment . recently , there has been a great interest in plamonics@xcite and plasmon - based optoelectronics , due to the possibility of using these materials as building blocks for nanophotonics we theoretically investigate the superradiant fano resonances ( frrs ) in @xmath0-type doped transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) based on first - principles calculations .<n> we show that the fano effect , i.e. , the appearance of asymmetric fano spectral shape , is a result of the multipolar nature of excitations of subradiant resonances , and that a fano dip takes place at the frequency 1.6thz in the spectrum of frr . <n> recently , a new field of optoelectronic devices , so - called fanotronics , has emerged @xcite . in this new field ,<n> a single photon is coupled to an array of nano - structures such as quantum dots , superconducting qubits , or photonic crystals , leading to the observation of fano effects , which are the manifestation of multipolar excitations in the presence of a strong electric field . for a given material , fdtd ( fano field transistor )<n> is a device that provides the electric field distribution in the vicinity of a nano - structure , from which it can be observed directly . we theoretically investigate fano mode excitations in @xmath0-type superconductors by embedding four - rod resonators inside the bulk materials .<n> we show that the fano resonances in the @xcite-type superconductivity are suppressed in the normal state of the material due to a coherent coupling with the quadrupole excitation in two parallel rods . on the other hand ,<n> the fana resonances associated with the superradiant mode excitation in a normal state exhibit a deep dip in the extinction spectra of the materials due to an electric field confinement near edges of the normal and subradiant states induced by the near - field couplings with the s - type superconductor . <n> recently , it has been realized that the superconductor - normal state ( sc - ns ) transition can be controlled by applying an external electric field to the material@xcite . in this case , the sc -ns state can be tuned by varying the electric field and/or the fermi energy , which is useful for the development of spintronics devices . for the realization of spintronic devices , a superconductor with superradiance , such as sr@xmath1mno@ by embedding four - rod resonators inside double - split ring resonators superlattice , a composite metamaterial system is introduced , where a common subradiant oscillator in four - rods resonator is coupled with two superradiant dipoles in double - splits ring resonator , to give rise to double fano resonances . as a classical analogue of four - level tripod atomic system , the extinction spectrum of the composite metamaterials exhibits a coherent effect due to the conjugation of two coupling strengths , @xmath0 and @ x , which shows up as a transfer of absorbed power from one superradiants dipole to the other superradints dipoles , whose coupling strengths are , , and , respectively .<n> double fanon resonances are correlated owing to the coupling of two strengths . <n> coherent plasmonic resonances in nanoscale structures have been the focus of intensive research efforts in recent years , as they can be utilized in designing coherent effects in metamaterials @xcite . in particular ,<n> fano plasmons are of great interest for their potential applications in quantum information processing , quantum phase transitions in condensed matter physics , etc .. in this paper<n> , we * in this letter , we investigate the properties of the fano resonances in two - dimensional ( 2d ) metamaterials .<n> we show that the presence of the 2d metamaterial s center of mass induces an electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) in the fanos of the individual metamaterial elements , which is robust against disorder and disorder - induced backscattering . in contrast , the eit induced by the metamaterial is insensitive to disorder and can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the central metamaterial center - of - mass force . * _ introduction _ in recent years , it has become possible to manipulate light - matter interactions in a controlled way using the principles of electromagnetics , nonlinear optics , and quantum mechanics @xcite . among the various methods developed to achieve these goals ,<n> one of the most promising and widely used is the concept of plasmonic transparency ( pl ) , i.e. the ability of light to leak out of a metamaterial even in the absence of electromagnetic fields . for a long time , pl has been the object of intense research , both theoretically and experimentally . recently , there has been an increasing plasmonic rulers and metamaterials are promising candidates for multispectral sensing , manipulation , and communication over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales . here , we demonstrate that multiple fano resonances in planar plasmon - based metamaterials can be used to build a three - dimensional ruler with unprecedentedly high sensitivity .<n> we show that the fano effect can be enhanced by using split nanorings as metamaterial clusters to tune the multiple resonances . in combination with electromagnetically induced transparency ,<n> we demonstrate a tenfold increase in sensing sensitivity over that of a single resonance . <n> the ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale is a central goal in science and technology . among the various approaches that have been proposed for the manipulation of electromagnetic fields , _<n> one of the most prominent and widely studied is the concept of electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) @xcite , which induces transparency in a metamaterial due to the presence of the electromagnetic field in the material s bulk . since eit is inherently robust to imperfections in the metamaterial structure , its use for sensing and control<n> is expected to have broad applications in areas ranging from material science and engineering to biology . double electromagnetically induced transparency ( det ) has been widely used in optical phase gate , optical switching , and photonic quantum information processing .<n> however , it has not been widely exploited in multi - level meta - atoms , three - dimensional plasmonic rulers , or other multi - plasmon - interacting systems . here<n> , we propose a versatile method for det based on a four - level tripod atomic system , which can be used as a tunable phase gate and a multi - mode optical switch . in the proposed method ,<n> the four levels of the tripod system are coupled by a two - photon interaction . by varying the relative strength of the interaction between the two levels , the det gate<n> can be enhanced or decreased , depending on the degree of transparency of the other level . <n> optical phase gates ( opes ) are essential for optical information processing ( ic ) and quantum communication ( qc ) @xcite . among the various phase gate schemes , there are two important types of schemes : ( i ) matched slow pulses ( scp ) based on electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit )  we report terahertz ( thz ) plasmon - induced transparency ( pl ) measurements in twisted nematic and nematic - metamaterial ( nem ) superlattices .<n> we find that the pl of the nem and nem - metamaterials are comparable in magnitude , with the latter exhibiting more than three orders of magnitude higher pl than the former . by switching the resonance between the two structures ,<n> we demonstrate optical switching of the pl , making this a promising method for terahertz optical switching . <n> optical switching ( os ) is a widely used method to switch the transmission of light @xcite . in os<n> , a light beam is split into two parts , one part which is reflected and the other which is transmitted , and the os axis is rotated about the axis of the reflected light beam . the transmitted light is referred to as the _ os@xmath0 _ mode . for a given frequency @xmath1 , _<n> i.e. _ the light frequency of the input light is equal to the frequency of _ i.i.d_. the output light is also equal to @x we study the local density of optical states ( ldos ) of twisted fano terahertz ( thz ) metamaterials .<n> we show that the metamaterial s local ldos can be tuned by applying an external electric field , or by tuning the material s parameters , such as the ring radius , the number of metamolecules , and the applied field . in the case of a split - ring resonator metamaterial<n> , we find that the ldos of the metamolecule can be switched from negative to positive in the resonance , due to phase - reversal of the fano line . <n> plasmonic metamaterials ( pmms ) are a class of active metamaterials that can be used to modify the properties of metamaterials such as their linewidth , line shape , phase reversal , etc.@xcite . among the many ways to modify metamaterial properties ,<n> one of the simplest and most widely studied is to tune the shape of a fano resonance . for a single metamolecule @xmath0@xmath1 , one can tune the width of the resonance by applying a sinusoidal electric field @xcite or by applying two sinus we investigate the properties of near - field fano resonances in plasmonic metamaterials , focusing on the role of the coupling between the electromagnetic field and the local density of optical states ( ldos ) of the metamolecules .<n> we find that the ldos is strongly affected by the configuration interaction of the electromagnetic fields , leading to phase and amplitude modulations of the resonances , as well as changes in the relative intensities of the different fano components . in a planar metamaterial ,<n> the coupling of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and ldos can be used to control the transparency of the material , to switch the material from one transparency regime to another , and to measure the density of states . <n> the ability to manipulate light - matter interactions in the terahertz ( thz ) frequency range is of great interest for a variety of applications @xcite , including terahertz spectroscopy , microscopy and imaging , optical actuation , sensing and information processing . among these applications , the most common mode of excitation is the fano ( f ) resonance , which is the most prominent fano mode in the spectrum of plasmons and is responsible for we investigate the role of electromagnetic interactions on the line shape of plasmonic fano resonances in metallic nanostructures .<n> we find that the fano - like interference of resonances of different line shapes is a sensitive indicator of the electromagnetic interaction between the metal and the plasmons , which can be used to detect the symmetry breaking in the structure of the nanostructure . <n> [ [ section ] ] one of the most fundamental aspects of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in nanostructures is the well - known fano effect @xcite , i.e. the interference of light reflected from a nanoantenna with the electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( emti ) of the surrounding medium . in a typical setup ,<n> the emti induces transparency at the angstrom - scale of the metal structure , while at the one - dimensional ( 1d ) angstrom scale it induces transparency of the conduction band of the material , giving rise to the famous fano phenomenon . here<n> , we study the influence of the interaction between light and metal on the properties of the resonances that appear in the near - field region of the 1d emti and in the far - field of plasmonic autoionization resonances and dark plasmons in metallic nanostructures are investigated when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are externally driven .<n> it is shown that the characteristic asymmetric line shape of fano resonances is retained in the excitation spectra , where a sequence of constructive and destructive interferences between continuum and discrete resonances takes place . in - phase and out - of - phase interferences depend on whether the discrete resonance falls on the red or blue side of the background continuum resonance , and the asymmetric fano line shape is characterized by 3 parameters , the resonance shift and the resonance width . differently from a dark mode in atomic spectroscopy ,<n> there exits an intrinsic non - radiative joule loss in a plamonic dark mode when electromagnetically driven , giving rise to a modulation damping parameter @xmath0 , a measure of the decrease in fano contrast . <n> * introduction.*@xmath1 in recent years , non - equilibrium effects have been shown to play an important role in a wide range of physical systems , ranging from atomic spectroscopy to atomic and molecular physics , as well as quantum optics and condensed matter physics.@xcite in particular  a coherent coupling between a driven subradiant narrow oscillator and a driven superradiant oscillator causes a modification of the lorentzian spectrum of the former by introducing a modulation damping parameter @xmath0 , where a measure of the decrease in fano resonance contrast is introduced .<n> it is found that asymmetric fano - like asymmetric line shape persists even in the presence of the coherent coupling . <n> # 1@xmath1#1 in this paper , we study the local density of states in a coherently driven plasmonic structure composed of a nano - rod and surrounding hexamer ring . in the absence of a coupling ,<n> a fano line shape is observed in the density of optical states , which is fitted to the general fano formula @xcite with an excellent agreement . here<n> we raise the question whether fano shape is retained even when both superradiants and subradiants are driven simultaneously by a coherent excitation beam . to this end<n> , a simple mechanical two coupled oscillators model is adopted , in which a driven narrow oscillator is dressed by an intrinsic non -

stratonovich equation . as a consequence ,<n> the effect of a random perturbation on the velocity distribution of light can not be described by means of a simple gaussian random field . <n> the study of the properties of a system under the influence of an external force is one of the cornerstones of modern statistical mechanics . over the last decades<n> , there has been a growing interest in this topic , particularly because of its potential applications in the fields of information processing ( e.g. , quantum computation ) and metrology @xcite . among the various theoretical approaches proposed to study the behavior of a macroscopic system under an external field , stochastic monte carlo ( smc ) we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the relaxation dynamics of a classical non - equilibrium steady - state system described by a fokker - planck equation with a univariate stochastic noise .<n> we show that the long - time asymptotics of this stochastic system is governed by a set of trigonometric langevin equations . using these equations ,<n> we study thermal effects in a simple model of a magnetic field rotating in a harmonic potential . in the long time limit<n> , we find that the relaxation time @xmath0 is proportional to the square root of the system s time scale , which is a nonmonotonic function of the temperature , the magnetic field strength , and the frequency of the rotating component of the field . <n> pacs numbers : 05.70.ln , 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r over the past few years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of equilibrium relaxation dynamics in nonequilibrium steady - states of many - body systems described by stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) @xcite . due to the fact that the problem is non - linear and , in general , non - perturbative , we study the effect of magnetic nanoparticles in an external field on the dynamics of an open quantum system .<n> it is shown that the presence of nanoparticles can strongly affect the long - time behavior of the system , which is described by a set of coupled deterministic and stochastic differential equations . in the limit of strong fields ,<n> the deterministic equations are reduced to trigonometric equations , while the stochastic equations are solved in the mean - field approximation . using these solutions<n> , we demonstrate that the reduced nanoparticle magnetization leads to a non - monotonic dependence of the steady - state nanoparticles magnetization on the nanoparticle - field coupling strength . <n> _ introduction. _ in recent years , the field of nanomagnetism has experienced a rapid development @xcite , due to the demonstration of various interesting phenomena in magnetic nanoparticles , such as the emergence of the @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry in magnetization @x<n> . however , there is no general consensus about the origin of this symmetry breaking , and it is still an open problem to find the mechanisms that lead to its breaking . to this end , it is important to understand the interplay between the particle magnetization and the applied magnetic field  the effect of a reduced magnetic field frequency on the magnetization of maghemite nanoparticles in water is studied theoretically .<n> it is shown that the behavior of the reduced nanoparticle magnetization depends on the ratio of the polar and lag angles , and , in particular , it is qualitatively different in the regions of low and high field frequencies . <n> nanoparticles are used in a wide range of applications , from medicine to cosmetics , for the detection of drugs and for the analysis of data @xcite . in these applications<n> , the influence of a magnetic field on the properties of the nanoparticles is of great importance , because a reduced field frequency leads to a reduction of the effective magnetization @xmath0 , i.e. , to a change in the effective magnetic moment of the particles . at sufficiently low fields ,<n> the reduction of magnetization is accompanied by a corresponding increase of the nanoparticle effective magnetic field , which is referred to as a reduced - field effect ( lfpe ) . on the other hand , at sufficiently high fields<n> the effect is strongly suppressed , so that , if the field is applied in the direction normal to the nanoparticles , lfpes is absent  the magnetic response of nanomagnets is investigated in the framework of the classical maxwell - boltzmann equation .<n> the equations are solved numerically for maghemite ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) nanoparticles in water , and it is shown that the saturation magnetization of nanoparticles , dynamic viscosity of water and characteristic time at room temperature depend on the initial values of the polar and lag angles of the nanoparticles . in particular , the reduced angular frequency , which is defined as the ratio of the reduced to the maximal magnetization , decreases with increasing temperature . <n> nanoparticles are model particles that have been extensively studied in the last years @xcite . here<n> , we investigate the response of nanoparticles to the change of the external parameters , such as temperature , pressure , magnetic field , viscosity , or velocity , in such a way that the properties of nanoparticles change with the changes of these parameters . for this purpose ,<n> the maxwell s equations are numerically solved in the presence of an external magnetic field by using the gaussian quadrupole method ( gqm ) and the monte carlo method ( mc ) . the equations for the magnetization we show that the rotational motion of a nanoparticle in a magnetic field is determined by its reduced angular frequency , which is a direct consequence of the magnetoelastic coupling between the magnetization and the rotation of the nanoparticles .<n> we demonstrate that this effect is universal in the sense that it holds for all possible values of the reduced magnetic field frequency and is independent of the initial conditions of the polar and lag angles . <n> the study of the dynamics of nanoparticles ( or mesoscopic systems ) is one of the most active areas in the field of nanosciences . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the properties of nanoparticles @xcite . for example , it has been shown that , in the presence of an external magnetic field , a nanoparticle magnetization can be driven into a steady - state by the action of the magnetic field and the motion of the nanoparticle can be controlled by tuning the strength of the field . moreover ,<n> the effect of the applied magnetic field on a mesmeric system can be used as a tool for the control of the mesmerization , i.e. , by changing the value of the effective magnetization . on the other hand , the effect we study the effect of rotation on magnetic nanoparticles embedded in a rotating magnetic background .<n> we show that the angular frequency of the nanoparticles depends on the initial polar angle of the background magnetic field and , in particular , it is proportional to the ratio @xmath0 , where the value of the initial magnetic field is equal to the nanoparticle magnetization , and the angle between the nanoparticle rotation and the background field is zero . <n> magnetic nanoparticles ( nps ) can be used as building blocks in various nanodevices @xcite . in these devices ,<n> the size of the np can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field , e.g. , by changing the shape of the sample . as a result<n> , np s size can be reduced , manipulated , or even incorporated into a device , for example , into an optical nanoantenna , a magnetic nanopillar , an optical switch , etc . for a given size np<n> can be coupled to a reference system , thus , allowing to control its size , position , size distribution , as well as its shape and size - dependent properties such as coherence length , we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the rotational dynamics of single - domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles with frozen magnetization .<n> we show that thermal fluctuations completely destroy the rotational regime of nanoparticles , which exists at infinitesimally small values of the rotating magnetic field @xmath0 , the ratio of the nanoparticle magnetization to the free energy , and the particle size . in the noiseless case ,<n> the steady - state solution of the fokker - planck equation can be expressed as a function of two variables : the magnetization and the temperature . depending on the model parameters , we find that , in the low - temperature limit , this solution can be represented by the sine - gordon equation , while in the high - temperature regime , it is described by the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation . <n> magnetization of a particle can be frozen by applying an external magnetic field , or it can be generated by an external parameter ( such as temperature ) . for a given value of the external parameter<n> , magnetization can remain frozen even when the particle is moving under the influence of an external field . on the other hand , for the same reason , there is no we derive the fokker - planck equation for the steady - state probability density @xmath0 of a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we show that the solution of this equation , which is expressed in terms of the green s function , depends only on the magnitude of the external field , in the limit when the ratio between the chemical potential and the trapping time is small . in this limit<n> , the bec undergoes a phase transition from a bec with long - range order to a disordered one . <n> pacs numbers : 05.30.-d , 05.40.-a , 03.65.sq _ introduction _ the study of equilibrium properties of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . due to the high complexity of such systems , it is not possible to perform monte carlo simulations . instead ,<n> _ ab initio _ methods are used to study the properties of the steady state of these systems @xcite . the so - called monte - carlo approach , based on the diagonalization of the we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a particle in a rotating gravitational field .<n> we show that , contrary to what is usually assumed , thermal fluctuations can not prevent the existence of a non - equilibrium steady - state . in this case<n> , the field can be described by effective langevin equations , which take into account the rotation of the gravitational field and thermal fluctuations . by means of numerical simulations ,<n> we demonstrate that these effects are more pronounced in the regime of high rotation rates . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.yz , 05.30.jp , 42.50.lc the study of the collective dynamics of many interacting quantum systems is one of the main topics in modern physics . due to the large number of degrees of freedom that can be achieved in these systems , it is possible to investigate the behavior of the system in a wide range of different situations , such as in the presence of gravitational fields @xcite , in the linear regime of the schrdinger equation @xmath0 , or in the non - linear regime ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for recent reviews ) . for a given system , we study the transient properties of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the transient regime by means of the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation method .<n> the latter is based on the solution of a transient evolution equation , which is solved by the runge - kutta method and is solved exactly in the limit of zero temperature . in this limit<n> , transient processes are transient in the sense that they last only a finite time and their properties are determined by the transient processes . here , we focus on the properties of the transient condensate that is formed during the transient phase of the condensate evolution . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce the concept of the mean - field transient condensate and calculate the transient probability densities , i.e. , the difference between the steady - state and equilibrium probability densities at the initial time when the transient process is completed , as a function of the temperature and the system - bath coupling constants . we find that these densities are in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction for the temperature dependence of the latter . <n> one of the most important problems in the physics of condensed matter is the study of the dynamics of transient we show that the magnetization and angular frequency of nanoparticles in a viscous fluid depend on their polar and lag angles , but not on their initial values .<n> this is in contrast to the case of a noiseless fluid , where both properties depend only on the average value of the initial nanoparticle magnetization @xmath0 , and on the lag angle , which is a random variable . using the fokker - planck equation as well as the effective langevin equations , we predict and study subtle effects due to the rotation of the particles . in particular , it is shown that the angular frequency is a nonmonotonic function of the polar angle ; this effect can be used to control the properties of biopolymers and nanoparticles . <n> nanoparticles in solids are usually considered to be free rotators , i.e. , they do not interact with the surrounding medium . however , in many applications , nanoparticles need to interact with it , for instance in the field of biomedicine @xcite , catalysis in nanoparticles - based nanocomposites and in nanoparticles used in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . as a result ,<n> it is important to understand the interaction between nanoparticles and we study the effect of thermal torque on the rotation of magnetic nanoparticles driven by a circularly polarized magnetic field .<n> we show that the thermal torque of arbitrary strength completely destroys the periodic regime of nanoparticle rotation , which exists in the noiseless limit at @xmath0 , and leads to the non - monotonic behavior of the average angular frequency of rotation . <n> magnetic nanoparticles are used in a wide variety of applications , ranging from medicine to cosmetics and electronics . in many of these applications<n> they are subjected to external forces , e.g. , due to an external magnetic field @xcite . as a result of these forces<n> , nanoparticles can have a non - uniform distribution of angular momentum , leading to a variety of non - trivial phenomena , such as the appearance of vortices in the dispersion relation of a rotating particle , the emergence of the kerr effect , or the stabilization of a nanorotor under the action of a static magnetic field ( see , for example , refs . and references therein ) . to understand these effects ,<n> it is of interest to study the dynamics of nanoparticles under the influence of thermal noise , in particular , when the we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of nanoparticles in a precessing magnetic field . in the noiseless case , the steady - state dynamics has a precessional character , and the angular frequency of rotation @xmath0 is a deterministic quantity .<n> we show that thermal fluctuations can either increase or decrease the frequency of the rotation as compared with the deterministic case . specifically , if the magnetic precession frequency is larger than the thermal energy , then thermal fluctuations increase the frequency , when the magnetic field is stronger ( when the energy is smaller than the torque ) and decrease it when the field is weaker ( when it is stronger ) . as a result , in the presence of a torque , both the average angular frequency and the reduced angular frequency can be affected by thermal fluctuations . <n> nanoparticles are used in a wide range of applications , from biomedicine to catalysis @xcite , where they serve as efficient carriers of information , or can be used as building blocks of new materials . due to their size and small dimensions ,<n> the mechanical and electronic properties of nanoparticles are determined by their internal degrees of freedom , which can be either non - linear ( thermal effects ) we investigate the role of thermal effects in the dynamics of precessing colloidal nanoparticles .<n> we show that thermal torque essentially influences the average characteristics of the precessional motion of nanoparticles , which is in sharp contrast with the noiseless case , where the dynamics is described by constant polar and lag angles . in particular , due to the action of the thermal torque , the reduced angular frequency of precession of nanoparticles becomes less than the magnetic field frequency , i.e. , @xmath0 , for all finite values of the parameter . as a result ,<n> the thermal coupling between precession and magnetization of nanoparticles can not be neglected in the design of nanoparticles - based nanodevices . _<n> introduction._@xmath1 nanoparticles are widely used in the field of nanosciences as building blocks of various nanostructures , such as dna hairpins @xcite , t - dnas ( hairpin - like hairpins ) , carbon nanotubes ( c - nanotubes ) and graphene ( carbon nanotube - like nanotubes , or graphene nanoribbons , also known as carbon nanotubes or cn - rings ) as well as in the fields of nanomedicine @x we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the precession of magnetic nanoparticles in a rotating magnetic field .<n> it is shown that the average value of the reduced magnetization as a function of the parameter @xmath0 , which describes the strength of the thermal fluctuations , exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on the parameter . in the noiseless case ,<n> this dependence is equal to the result of a classical particle in a thermal bath . <n> the problem of the magnetic precession ( pm ) of nanoparticles is of fundamental importance in the field of nanomagnetism @xcite , and has been intensively studied in recent years . due to its importance<n> , there has been a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental studies of pm in nanoparticles . on the theoretical side , in the last decade<n> a great progress has been achieved in the description of the dynamics of nanoparticles in rotating magnetic fields , especially in the framework of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) theory . at the same time , however , the experimental investigation of the properties of the pm in the presence of thermal noise has not been carried out yet , although it has been observed in a number of experiments we have studied both analytically and numerically the rotational properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticle in a viscous fluid driven by a precessing magnetic field .<n> our approach is based on the system of multiplicative langevin equations for the polar and azimuthal angles of the nanoparticle magnetization frozen into the massless nanoparticle . from these equations , approximating the cartesian components of the random torque by gaussian white noises and interpreting them in an arbitrary way , we have derived the corresponding fokker - planck equation . by associating the stationary solution of this equation with the boltzmann probability density ,<n> we have established that the basic system of langevin equation should be interpreted in the stratonovich sense , and have reproduced the known system of effective lennard - jones equations . within this framework , the statistical properties of its solution do not depend on the interpretation of multi plicative white noises . using the corresponding system of effectively langevin and fokkers , _<n> i.e. _ , by interpreting the random noise as a random force acting in the @xmath0-direction and interpreting it as a stochastic force with an arbitrary strength and distribution , as well as the we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the magnetic after - effect in ferromagnetics in the form of small particles , with applications to baked clay . using the system of effective langevin equations and the corresponding fokker - planck equation , we have calculated the average angular frequency of precession of nanoparticles and the average magnetization of nanoparticles in the @xmath0-direction , and analyzed their dependence on the model parameters . in the noiseless limit , the dependence of these quantities on the rotating field frequency and amplitude is different whether a constant component of the magnetic field is zero or not . when the steady - state rotation of nanoparticles has the precessional character , a general expression for the nanoparticle magnetization has been derived and , in the latter case , their sum is strictly equal to 1 ( in dimensionless units ) for any rotating field . finally , by comparing the numerical results for this difference with the results obtained from the analytical solution of the fokler - plancks equation .<n> we have observed a number of interesting thermal effects . <n> in particular , it has turned out that the deterministic regime of rotation of nanoparticle , which exists when a constant magnetic fields is infinitesimally small precessional dynamics of small nanoparticles in an external magnetic field is considered .<n> the effect of thermal fluctuations on the angular frequency of nanoparticle rotation as a function of the constant magnetic field strength is discussed . <n> pacs number(s ) : 05.20.dd , 05.30.-d , 75.10.pq = -10 mm = -5 mm * precession of nanoparticles in a magnetic field : + thermal fluctuations and + rotation * + v.v.r . spin -

scale magnetic structures are single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , single - domain magnets , and superparamagnetic nanoparticles ( spnp ) are a new class of materials with many potential applications .<n> however , the synthesis of spnps and their physical and chemical properties are not well understood . in this paper , we address this issue by reporting a comprehensive synthesis and characterization of single - crystalline iron oxide ( sio ) nanoparticles , which are structurally similar to conventional sio nanoparticles but have a broader range of properties , including stability , adsorption , surface chemistry , characterization , biocompatibility and , most importantly , potential applications in medicine and biology . <n> * introduction . * over the last decade , there has been a rapid rise in interest in the use of magnetic nanoparticles as carriers of information , for example , in medicine @xcite , engineering applications in materials science and engineering ( e.g. , photovoltaics , catalysis , spintronics , ... ) and in research and development ( r&d ) of new nanodevices and materials . at the same time , progress has been made in understanding and harnessing the properties of these nanoparticles we present a new approach to the theory of the dispersion of magnetic permeability in ferromagnetic bodies based on the effective - field method .<n> the method is applied to the case of a magnetic nanoparticle immersed in a two - dimensional ferromagnetic fluid , and a current - driven oscillation of the nanoparticle axis of rotation is studied . <n> the present work is dedicated to the memory of l. d. landau ( 1933 - 2011 ) , a pioneer in the field of magnetic materials . in 1935 ,<n> sowjet @xcite showed that the magnetic permeability of a ferromagnetic body is a non - monotonic function of the distance from the surface , @xmath0 , i.e. , there is a dispersion relation for the permeability that depends on the surface orientation and the strength of the ferromagnetic coupling . since then<n> , many theories have been developed to explain the dispersion relation , including the well - known gilbert - landau - lifshitz ( gll ) theory @x<n> . however , these theories can not be generalized to systems in contact with a magnetic fluid . as a result , it is necessary to introduce the concept of the effective field method ( efm ) we study the dynamics of a magnetic nanoparticle in a viscous liquid under the influence of a rotating magnetic field .<n> the nanoparticle is considered as a non - interacting particle in a mean - field approximation of the fokker - planck equation . for the case when the magnetic field<n> is perpendicular to the orientation of the nanoparticle , we obtain the orientational kinetics of the magnetic nanoparticle and the particle s free energy . in the case of the rotating field ,<n> the energy of the particle is localized near the field and its average is non - monotonic . <n> the effective field method ( efm ) @xcite has become the standard method for the calculation of the free energy of a system in a rotating field @xmath0 . here<n> , the use of the efm method is mainly motivated by its applicability to the study of thermal ratchets in ferrofluids and magnetic fluids . however , in the last years there has been a growing interest in the application of efm to other systems , such as thermodynamics , fluid dynamics , chemistry , and biology ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) . as an example , we consider the stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) of the form @xmath0 , where the first term is a stochastic gradient and the second term is an ordinary differential equation .<n> we show that this equation can be reduced to a fokker -

priori arbitrarily close to the optimal codes . in this way<n> , codewords can be seen as a new type of resource for quantum communication protocols . <n> quantum information theory has a long history , in particular as the foundation for the foundations of quantum mechanics , e.g. @xcite , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , is one of the most powerful tools available for the distribution of cryptographic keys , being at the same time the foundation of the quantum internet , an emerging technology for the communication of large numbers of quantum bits ( qubits ) with high efficiency and security . a crucial ingredient for the efficient distribution of quantum information is the problem of secret key generation , where the security of the secret key is guaranteed by the transmission of a we propose a general framework for the design of high - performance quantum key distribution ( qkd ) stages .<n> the framework is based on the notion of a povm , which is a useful tool for the analysis of the performance of a decoding stage . in particular , we show that it is possible to design decoding stages that are asymptotically optimal with respect to the amount of information that can be extracted from the codeword , as the number of the decoding steps increases . <n> quantum information theory has a long history , but it is becoming increasingly recognized that the security of the information carried by a physical system can not be guaranteed on the basis of classical mechanics . as a result , in the last decade , a number of important breakthroughs have been achieved , e.g. in the area of dense coding @xcite . among the most important of them is the seminal result of shannon on the heisenberg s  no - go theorem '' @xmath0 , stating that any attempt to extract information by means of a machine , other than deterministic methods , is inevitably accompanied by some error . on the other hand ,<n> there is also a growing interest in the we present a technique to detect the average state of a codeword transmitted through an error channel .<n> the scheme is based on the povm of the average codeword s state and can be used to bound the average error probability , as well as the average of the mean state of the source . in particular , we show that the average and mean error probabilities are asymptotically null for large values of the channel modulus @xmath0 , and asymptotically zero for small values . <n> error correction codes @xcite are used in a wide variety of applications , ranging from medical to communications , where they are used to improve the quality of vidas or conintegrate a system with a meter . for the latter ,<n> it is important to be able to detect and quantify the errors made during the course of the correction process , in order to minimize the impact of these errors on the patient s quality of care , or to ensure that the system can perform its task with minimal impact on the performance of the code . among the most prominent error correction schemes , one of the most widely used is the code - rate - distance scheme , which provides an upper bound on the average rate of the error we present a protocol for error detection in a quantum communication process .<n> the scheme is based on a set of @xmath0 quantum codes , each of which can be used to transmit a single classical message over a channel of arbitrary length . in case of quantum communication<n> the average error probability can be bounded to zero . <n> quantum communication @xcite is a powerful tool for communication in various contexts . among them ,<n> one of the most important is quantum communication due to the fact that it allows one to perform quantum communication even when the state of the communication is unknown . at the same time<n> , quantum communication can also be used as a resource for quantum computation , e.g. for quantum key distribution @x<n> . however , the security of such quantum communication protocols is not obvious . indeed , it is well known that if the channel is known , then the probability of error is exponentially small . on the other hand , if we do not know the channel , we can  guess '' the channel and the error probability will be large . as a result , in the case of a classical communication , there is no bound on the average probability of an error . we present a protocol for the transmission of quantum information over a distance of up to @xmath0 m using linear optical elements and a single photon detector .<n> the average error of the protocol is found to be of the same order of magnitude as that of the best classical protocols . <n> quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite is a powerful tool for the transfer of large - scale quantum information , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) or teleportation . in practice , however , the amount of information that can be processed in such a process can be quite large , and it is not always possible to achieve perfect secrecy . as a consequence , it is important to be able to estimate the errors that are accumulated during the process , which can be quantified by , e.g. , average error probability ( aep ) . for this purpose ,<n> a class of protocols , known as quantum dense coding protocols ( qdcs ) have been proposed , in which alice and bob share a linear optical device , i.e. a pair of high - finesse , single - photon detectors , for the exchange of information between them  we investigate the performance of a multi - channel quantum key distribution ( qkd ) code in the presence of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .<n> we show that , in contrast to the case of a single - channel code , the average performance of such a code can be significantly improved if the channel is subjected to a noise term , e.g. an additive @xmath0-th power . in this case<n> the performance can be increased by increasing the strength of the additive noise , provided that the latter is below a certain threshold . for this purpose<n> we introduce the concept of super - operators , which allows us to express the average of a given code in terms of a super - operator of a more general class . <n> the development of quantum communication technology has led to the establishment of important connections between quantum mechanics and cryptography , such as key distribution , quantum teleportation , and superdense coding @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> significant efforts have been devoted to the study of the asymptotic behavior of a quantum channel under noise in different scenarios , ranging from classical to quantum ones , with the aim of understanding the limits of the performance achievable in such scenarios we present a tight bound for the error probability in quantum teleportation that is independent of the teleportation state .<n> the bound is valid for arbitrary initial states of the sender and receiver , and it is achieved by applying a holevo - type inequality to the quantum state , which we prove to be achievability . in particular , we do not need to assume that the initial state is a maximally entangled state ; we only need to consider the case of @xmath0 entangled initial states . <n> quantum state teleportation ( qst ) @xcite , where the sender encodes a quantum state ( e.g. , a qubit ) to alice s computer in the form of a classical channel , is one of the most important achievements of quantum information science to date . as such<n> , it has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in the last decade , both in theory ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) and in practice ( see e. g. refs ..<n> ) . despite the great success of the original proposal , however , there are still many open questions as to what is the maximally in this paper we show that the hilbert space @xmath0 of an open quantum system is a convex set of eigenvalues , i.e. it is convex in the number of particles , but not in the density of states .<n> this fact allows us to derive a new inequality , which is more general than the one previously derived in the literature , and which is valid for any _ finite _ number of interacting particles . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an upper bound for the decoherence time of a generic two - level system . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the dynamics of quantum many - body systems is one of the most active areas in modern physics . in this context<n> , the problem of how a quantum system behaves in the presence of noise has attracted a great deal of attention , both theoretically and experimentally , in recent years . from a practical point of view<n> the problem is that of how the system s dynamics is affected by the interaction with the environment . on the one hand<n> this has a direct impact on the performance of quantum computation and communication protocols , on the other hand it also provides new insights on the nature of the ground state we derive a family of lower bounds for the number of eigenvalues of a one - dimensional quantum master equation in the thermodynamic limit .<n> these bounds are expressed in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of a single non - hermitian operator and are obtained by reducing the problem to a finite set of coupled ordinary differential equations . as an application , we consider the thermodynamics of a two - level system in the presence of adiabatic and radiative losses . <n> _ introduction. _ the study of the thermodynamic properties of many - body quantum systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in this context<n> the interest is twofold : on the one hand , the problem is important for the understanding of the behavior of a large class of quantum systems , and on the other hand it is of interest for the application of quantum thermodynamics to thermodynamic problems , such as the determination of the temperature of a bose - einstein condensate @xcite . for quantum systems in equilibrium ,<n> the most relevant thermodynamic quantities are the entropy and the free energy , which are defined as functions of the system s system - bath coupling and system parameters , respectively . from a theoretical point of view we derive a universal bound on the magnitude of the @xmath0-th power of a real - valued gaussian operator acting on the hilbert space of an open quantum system .<n> we show that the bound is tight for all values of the coupling constant , including the experimentally relevant one , and that it is independent of the sign of the operator . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the seminal work of wheeler and dewitt @xcite on open quantum systems , quantum mechanics has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation . in recent years<n> much progress has been made in understanding the behavior of quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit . however , in spite of this , there are still many open questions , such as how quantum systems behave in the presence of disorder , or when they do not obey the predictions of classical mechanics . a central question in quantum mechanics<n> is how a quantum system behaves when it is subjected to an external potential . for a given potential ,<n> the ground state of the system is known to be a mixed state , i.e. a state that is invariant under time reversal symmetry ( rhs ) but not under time - reversal invariance  we introduce a new strategy for the sequential detection of binary codes with asymptotically vanishing error in the asymptotic limit of large numbers of messages .<n> we show that this strategy allows to send messages with vanishing error with probability @xmath0 , independently of the size of the code and of the error rate , provided that the latter is bounded by an explicit function of the input parameters . <n> [ sec2 ] quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is one of the most widely used quantum communication protocols . in its simplest form ,<n> it is based on two main ingredients : the transmission of a classical message and the identification of the sender , i.e. the receiver , who is supposed to be the one who sent the message . as a result , in the limit of an infinitely large number of outgoing messages , known as the capacity of the system , the capacity to send a message with a known error rate is bounded from below by the capacity for sending a single classical message , which is called the capacity . on the other hand , as soon as a binary code is communicated over a quantum channel , it is important to be able to detect whether the receiver has detected the the holevo bound on the average error probability of a code @xcite can be used to bound the rate at which quantum information can be sent over a communication channel . here<n> we present a detection scheme that achieves the quantum capacity of a quantum channel with sequential detection of codeword states .<n> we show that this scheme can achieve asymptotically vanishing error probability for all rates @xmath0 which satisfy the condition that the average is performed over all codewords of a given code , and over all possible codes . in other words ,<n> our new detection scheme provides an alternative demonstration of the achievability of the holesvo bound . <n> quantum information processing ( qip ) has the potential to revolutionize the way we transmit and process information . among the various techniques that have been proposed for qip<n> , one of the most promising is the use of quantum channels , where the transmission of quantum information is performed by means of codes generated by a small number of auxiliary particles , each of which can be thought of as a small quantum system ( e.g. , a qubit ) . the error probability ( er ) of a message sent over such a channel is the average of the er we present a protocol for the direct detection of a binary codeword based on an iterative measurement procedure .<n> this protocol does not require any _ a priori _ knowledge about the codeword , and it is robust to noise . in particular , we show that the error probability associated with our protocol is equal to @xmath0 , where the error is the rate of the iterative measurement . <n> quantum state tomography is the study of the state of a quantum system in the most general sense of the term . as such<n> , it provides us with a powerful tool to study the properties of quantum systems , in particular to understand their structure and dynamics @xcite . among the various methods that have been proposed for its study ,<n> one of the most successful is quantum state discrimination @x , which allows one to distinguish between two possible states of a given quantum system : pure or mixed (  pure state '' or  mixed state '' ) . for a pure state<n> this is achieved by measuring the average state of the system , a task that can be performed in two steps : first a codeword is extracted from the system and then a measurement is performed on the extracted codewords we present a protocol based on a two - step measurement which allows one to perform a pretty good povm on a single two - qubit measurement .<n> the protocol consists of two steps . in the first step<n> a global unitary transformation is performed and then the measurement is performed on that part of the global system which emerges from the first measurement with the _ not _ finding of the input qubit in the typical subspace @xmath0 of the measurement subspace . at the end of the remaining two steps<n> a simple global unitary gate is applied . <n> measurement is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics and it has been intensively studied in recent years @xcite . among the various measurements which can be performed on a quantum system ,<n> the well - known one is the one which is based on the local operation and measurement ( lo ) principle . here<n> we show that the lo measurement is not only the best possible but it is also the most suitable one for a number of important applications , in particular in the field of quantum communication , quantum computation , and quantum metrology . as we will show in the present paper<n> , this measurement is a rather different operation than the conventionally used pretty in this paper we derive a new type of positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) which we call the _ epsilon_-povm which is more robust than the standard _ pretty good measurement _ one @xcite .<n> we show that , contrary to the latter , our measurement is not affected by the randomness of the initial data . in particular , we prove that for a large class of measurements , including the ones which are relevant for quantum key distribution , the epsilon ' - slavnov - wolfenstein ( es - w ) measurement is the only one which is robust against randomness . <n> _ introduction _ the measurement of a physical quantity by a classical observer is one of the most fundamental , if not the most , ways to test the validity of quantum mechanics . for a given value of the parameter @xmath0 the measurement is said to be successful if the expectation value of some function of the measured quantity is equal to the expected value . on the other hand ,<n> a quantum system , in contrast , is not characterized by an expectation value but by its hamiltonian , i.e. , we propose a new method to measure the entanglement entropy of a quantum state .<n> the method is based on the concept of entanglement entropy as a measure of the amount of entanglement present in a state when it is initially quantum state with a reduced degree of entanglement . as an example<n> , we use this method to study the entanglement properties of the ground state of a spin-@xmath0 two - level system . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics . in classical mechanics<n> the state of an open quantum system can not be described by a classical wavefunction , but rather by a set of non - commuting observables @xmath1 , such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the state variables @xcite . for a system with a large number of particles ,<n> the number of observables grows exponentially with the size of the system , so that it is impossible to measure all of the observables at once . on the other hand , in quantum mechanics one can measure entanglement _ exactly _ , i.e. , one can solve a system of equations to obtain all of its eigenstates , and then measure its entanglement entropy , which is we study the capacity of a noisy quantum channel with general signal states .<n> we show that the capacity is given by the product of the channel s capacity for classical information transmission and the average signal power of the environment . <n> quantum channels have been intensively studied in the last years @xcite . in this context , the capacity @xmath0 of a quantum channel to transmit classical information is of great importance , since the classical channel is the only channel able to convey this kind of information with high fidelity . on the other hand ,<n> it is well known that classical information can also be transmitted via quantum channels , if the signal states of the quantum channel are known . here<n> , we consider the capacity to send classical information over a quantum noisy channel , i.e. , a channel in which the quantum state of the classical signal is unknown to the receiver . for this purpose<n> we introduce the notion of _ capacity _ , which is a new concept in quantum information theory , and<n> show that it can be expressed in terms of the capacity for the classical information to be transmitted over the quantum noiseless channel . we present a general formula for capacity of a classical quantum channel , which can be used to prove the universal channel coding theorem for classical - quantum channels .<n> the formula is a generalization of the channel capacity formula of m. hayashi and h. nagaoka [ phys . <n> lett . a * 49 * , 1753 - 1768 ( 2003 ) ] . as an application<n> , we give a formula for the error exponent of the classical channel . optimal multiple quantum statistical hypothesis testing ( mmqs ) is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information theory .<n> it is known that mixed quantum states can not be distinguished with probability greater than @xmath0 ; however , this is not the case for pure quantum states . in this paper<n> , we show that mixed states can be distinguished in probability asymptotically , i.e. , the error exponent of mixed states is the same as that of pure states , and the converse to holevo s asymptotic optimality theorem holds for mixed states as well . <n> multiple quantum hypothesis testing @xcite has been shown to be a powerful tool for the analysis of the performance of quantum channels , as well as for the design of optimal protocols for classical - quantum channel coding . for the purpose of channel capacity analysis , it is important to understand the asymptotics of the error rates of quantum measurements . as a result of the holevo - stein s lemma ,<n> the error rate of a quantum measurement can be expressed as a function of the information theoretic measure of the state , namely the relative entropy , which is a measure of correlations between the state of the system and its environment we consider the problem of quantum state discrimination in the presence of noise .<n> the discrimination problem is formulated as a maximum - likelihood optimization problem , which can be solved analytically in the limit of large number of measurements . as an example<n> , we show how to find the optimal discrimination strategy for the belavkin - maslov test . <n> discrimination between two quantum states is one of the most important tasks in the field of quantum computing @xcite . in this paper<n> we consider a specific discrimination problem for quantum states @xmath0 , where the goal is to minimize the amount of information that can be lost in the event of an error in the measurement of a single quantum state . here<n> the error rate of the measurement is assumed to be known , and the objective is to find an optimal strategy for discrimination of the remaining quantum states . for this problem<n> we propose to use the maximum likelihood approach , a well - known approach in classical probability theory , as well as the converse to holevo s asymptotic optimality theorem , an approach that has been applied to a wide variety of statistical inference problems in computer science , engineering , mathematics , physics , biology , etc . @x",

mail : tsflor@physics.ucsd.edu_ + * keywords : * we derive the generalized kuramoto - sakaguchi @xmath0-superposition principle ( saf ) @xcite for the dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators in a state of strong synchronization .<n> we show that a network s synchrony properties can be optimized by choosing the oscillators natural frequencies for a given network ; arranging a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies on a given networks ; and building a network for agiven set of natural frequencies . in particular , we demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing several examples : ( i ) optimizing the coupling strength of a generic network to obtain a strong coupling state ; ( ii ) finding a pre - selected set of frequencies on the network , such that the network is in a strong synchronization state for that set ; or ( iii ) constructing a synchrony - optimized network . furthermore , our approach allows us to study the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization and the effect that optimizing synchronization has on directed network structure . for example , for directed networks with nodal in- and out - degrees , a strong , positive correlation between the in - degree and magnitude of the natural frequencies promotes synchronization ; however  we study the synchronization properties of directed and undirected networks of coupled phase oscillators .<n> we show that a phase - locked state of strong synchronization , i.e. , @xmath0t$ ] , can be obtained for networks with directed coupling functions that satisfy the moore - penrose pseudoinverse , and that the synchronization amplitude function ( saf ) generalizes the well - known kuramoto s law @xcite . for directed networks ,<n> we find that the generalized sf is characterized by a single parameter , the coupling strength , that can be tuned to control the degree of synchronization of the network . in the absence of this parameter<n> , synchronization is completely wiped out , even for networks that are sufficiently far away from each other . <n> synchronization is one of the most important collective behaviors in nature , occurring in a variety of contexts , ranging from the brain to the heart , from gene regulation to the internet . while synchronization has been the subject of intense study for many decades , it is only in the last few years that it has been realized that the dynamics of the oscillators in a network of coupled oscillators can be described we investigate the collective dynamics of networks where nodes interact only through the links of the network . in particular , we focus on the case of directed networks where the collective frequency of the synchronized population is not necessarily equal to the mean collective frequency . using a pseudoinverse formalism ,<n> we find that the synchronization frequency is given by a weighted average of the entries of the singular value decomposition of the synchronization matrix .<n> we also find that if the network is strongly connected , then the synchronization time @xmath0 scales with the number of network nodes as @math1 , and the synchronization coefficient is given in terms of the mean number of nodes . <n> the study of collective dynamics in complex networks has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite . to date , most of the theoretical work has focused on the effect of the topology of the networks on the dynamics . however , it is not always clear whether the topology has a significant effect on the collective behavior of the system , or whether the dynamics are determined solely by the topology . for example , if the nodes of a social network are arranged in a way that each node can be reached from any other node , the dynamics is determined by the nodes and synchronization is a key property of complex dynamical systems .<n> however , optimizing synchronization in directed networks remains a challenging problem . here , we show that a generalized version of the synchrony alignment function , which encodes the interplay between the oscillator dynamics and the network structure , can be used to optimize synchronization analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints . <n> synchronization is an essential dynamical phenomenon in diverse fields , ranging from physics to biology @xcite . in particular ,<n> synchronization plays an important role in the adaptive function of neural networks , and plays a critical role in many cellular processes @xmath0 . despite the importance of synchronization in cellular processes , the problem of optimizing synchronization properties in directed complex networks remains , to date , unresolved . to this end , it is important to understand the structure of directed networks and the constraints that govern their dynamical properties , in order to develop methods for optimizing the synchronization properties of a directed network . over the last decade , considerable effort has been devoted to the development of analytical and algorithmically - based methods for the optimization of synchronization properties for directed networks . while there is general agreement that network - specific optimization methods have the potential to synchronization is a key feature of complex biological , physical , and social systems .<n> we study synchronization in directed nonlinear oscillator networks , where the local oscillator dynamics are aligned with the network structure . using a generalized singular value ansatz ( saf ) ,<n> we show that optimization of the synchronization properties of directed networks can be performed analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints , using a network - based optimization method . <n> synchronization is one of the most important properties of living systems @xcite . in living systems , synchronization<n> is determined by many different factors , such as the number of active elements @xmath0 , the strength of the coupling between the elements , a nonlinear coupling function , as well as the nodal in - degree of the system . here<n> , we focus on synchronization of nonlinear oscillators in directed networks : in such networks the dynamics of the oscillators are localized on a small set of sites , called nodes , which are connected to the rest of the network via directed links . as a result , _<n> directed _ networks have a more complex structure than their undirected counterparts ; for example , we study the synchronization properties of complex networks of interacting harmonic oscillators .<n> we show that the optimization of the coupling strength and the natural frequencies can be jointly optimized using the so - called synchronization affinity function ( saf ) , which is a generalized version of the classical affinity function @xmath0 that takes into account the dynamical nature of the system and the constraints imposed by the network topology . in particular , we show how to optimally allocate natural frequencies in directed networks , to construct networks for a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies , and to construct a network for a given set of natural frequencies at each node . <n> the study of synchronization in complex networks has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years @xcite . among many examples , one of the most important is the synchronization of nonlinear oscillators in neuronal networks . for instance , in cardiac networks synchronization is crucial for the proper functioning of the heartbeat , a network - central nervous system that controls neuronal activity . moreover , synchronization plays a central role in the brain , where it controls information processing , communication , computation and perception . a large body of work has been done to understand and characterize the properties of networks of coupled oscillator we present a theoretical framework for the optimization of the sakaguchi - kuramoto coupling in complex networks .<n> we show that the optimal allocation of coupling strengths is determined by the mean degree of the underlying network structure , and we derive an analytical expression for the optimal choice of coupling function . in particular , we find that the coupling strength which minimizes the sum of the coupling strengths of the oscillators and the harmonics is always less than the optimal value , but can be as high as @xmath0 times the value of the optimally chosen coupling function when the latter is oscillator - only or oscillator - plus - higher - harmonic coupling . <n> complex networks are ubiquitous in science and technology , finding applications in areas as diverse as molecular biology @xcite , information processing @x<n> ] , engineering @x ] and internet - based communication . despite the ubiquity of these networks ,<n> the theoretical understanding of their symmetries is limited , especially in the case of complex coupling functions . here , the coupling of oscillators , for instance , is known to have a strong impact on network symmetry , since it is the only coupling function which is independent of the network  we consider synchronization of harmonic oscillators on a heterogeneous network , where each pair of oscillators is coupled to its nearest neighbors in a random fashion .<n> we consider two types of networks : edge - sharing ( er ) networks , in which each pair is connected to the rest of the network by a single edge , and single - file sharing ( sf ) in which pairs are connected to each other by a pair of edges , but do not interact with each other . using numerical simulations , we show that strong synchronization can be achieved over a wide range of coupling strengths , even for very small coupling strengths ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) . in particular , for er networks with filled markers , the optimal choice of natural frequencies clearly outperforms the random allocation over the entire range of the coupling strength , leading to strong synchronization even at very small values of coupling . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature @xcite , occurring in a variety of contexts , ranging from bacterial colonies to neural networks . while it has been recognized that synchronization is essential for many biological functions , such as the control of bacterial motility in cells , it is we study the synchronization of nonlinear oscillators on a heterogeneous network , where each pair of oscillators is coupled to all nodes of the network .<n> we consider two cases : ( i ) optimal oscillator arrangement , in which the set of natural frequencies is chosen from a standard normal distribution , and ( ii ) network construction . in both cases<n> , we find that the transition to synchronization is abrupt , but can be well approximated by a power law , with an exponent that depends on the degree of order in the system . <n> synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature @xcite , appearing in a wide range of fields , from physics to biology , chemistry , engineering , sociology , social sciences , computer science , medicine , biology and even robotics . despite its ubiquity ,<n> the dynamics of synchronization remain poorly understood , especially in complex networks . here<n> we address this problem in the context of synchronization in nonlinear oscillator networks , which consist of a network of nonlinearly coupled oscillators @xmath0 , each of which is connected to all other oscillators in the network through a nearest -

synchronized nodes in the network . using a novel iterative rewiring method , <n> we optimize the synchronization properties of heterogeneous networks and investigate the effects of directed network structures on optimal synchronization . <n> synchronization plays an important role in many biological and physical systems @xcite . in particular , it is critical to the functionality of cellular automata , such as the ability to respond rapidly to changes in gene expression or the synchronization of heartbeats @xmath0 . as such , synchronization plays a central role in the dynamical evolution of many cellular systems , including the control of gene expression , cell division , division of phenotypes , quorum sensing , immune system response , etc . despite the wealth of work on the subject , there is we investigate the effects of oscillator allocation , arrangement , and degree assortativity on optimal synchronization in directed networks . in particular , we focus on the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronizability . we find that disassortativity and assortative correlations between in- and out - degrees at each node in the network have a significant effect on the profiles of optimal synchronization .<n> we also find that optimal synchronization can not be characterized by a single oscillator per node , but rather requires a combination of many oscillators . <n> synchronization is a process by which the collective dynamics of a large number of interacting units are synchronized to achieve a common goal @xcite . to achieve this goal ,<n> many different types of networks are used , including directed networks ( er s ) , where each node is connected to the rest of the network via a directed network link , as well as undirected networks , i.e. , _ oscillators_. the goal is to synchronize the oscillators in the directed network so that they are synchronized at the same time on all network links . as such , optimal synchronization of directed networks is a highly complex dynamical problem , with synchrony is a key feature in biological , social , and technological networks .<n> however , the role of assortativity and disassortativity in optimizing synchronization properties of directed networks is not well understood . here<n> , we consider the problem of optimizing the synchrony of rewirings in electrostatic ( er ) and spin - field ( sf ) networks under constraints on the number of network realizations and frequencies of network oscillators . using numerical simulations ,<n> we show that assortative rewirings can improve synchrony , but that disas sortativity can lead to diminished synchronization properties . <n> synchronization is an essential biological function , with applications ranging from gene regulation to immune system response @xcite . in order to perform these functions , it is essential to synchronize the oscillators in a network , which in turn depend on the network connections and the frequencies of the network elements ( e.g. , switches , couplings , etc ) . for many natural and technological systems , synchronization is essential for performing tasks such as gene transcription , cell division , chemical reactions , optical communication , ... to name only a few . yet , in spite of synchronization in directed networks is important for a variety of applications .<n> however , little is known about the relative role of degree assortativity and disassortativity in optimizing synchronization properties of directed networks . here , we show that positive / negative degree as sortativity does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem . instead , when oscillators are optimally arranged , assortative networks tend to outperform disas sortative networks<n> . we also investigate the effect that optimization has on a given directed network s structure . <n> synchronization in networks is essential for a wide range of applications @xcite . in particular , synchronization is central to the operation of many biological networks , such as cell automata , neural networks and neural networks ; it is also crucial to many technological applications such as synchronization in high - performance computing ( hpc ) , communication networks and the internet . yet ,<n> the study of synchronization properties in networks has been hindered by the lack of understanding of the relative roles of degree and dissortativity . to this end , in this work we study the effect of optimization on synchronization properties by considering the following synchronization plays a central role in the functioning of a variety of systems , ranging from cell automata to neural networks , and from social networks to traffic networks . here , we study the effects of directedness of networks on the performance of optimal synchronization .<n> we find that the structural properties of optimized networks are correlated with the dynamical properties of the network , in a way that is qualitatively different for heavy - tailed frequencies , which are more sensitive to directedness , than for normal frequencies . <n> synchronization plays an important role in many natural , technological and social systems@xcite . in order for a system to be optimally synchronized ,<n> it is essential that its dynamical and structural properties are optimized . to this end<n> , it is important to understand the role of network structure in optimizing synchronization properties , as well as the relationship between structural and dynamical properties . for many natural and technological systems<n> the properties of synchronization are determined by the structure of the underlying network : for example , the dynamical response of a neuron to changes in its environment determines its ability to respond to changing stimuli , while the structural response of the entire network determines the ability of the system to perform its task . however , in this paper , we investigate the properties of synchrony - optimized networks , where a set of pre - chosen frequencies are optimized on a given network .<n> we present results for networks resulting from the optimization of the synchrony adaptation function ( saf ) , which is a measure of synchronization . in particular , in - degrees and natural frequencies of oscillators in the network<n> are found to be strongly correlated , with correlations between in- and out - degrees being stronger than correlations between natural frequencies . <n> we also consider the relationship between the dynamical and structural properties of optimal networks . for the optimization problem of rearranging a pre - selected frequency set on a directed network ,<n> we find that the optimal network has a high degree of heterogeneity in its out- and in - degree distributions , but a low degree of coherence in its in- degree distribution , suggesting that directed network structure plays a significant role in optimizing synchronization properties , compared to undirected network structure , and vice versa . +<n> * keywords : * synchrony optimization , synchronization , directed networks + * pacs : 05.45.+b , 89.75.fb , 05.10.-a , 87 we study the correlations between the natural frequencies of individual harmonic oscillators and their nodal in- and out - degrees .<n> we find that natural frequencies are strongly correlated with in - degree , but not with out - degree<n> . we also study the relationships between natural frequencies and the nodal quantities of neighboring oscillators , and find that in the directed case , these relationships are more nuanced than in the undirected case . for the optimization problem of rearranging a set of pre - chosen frequencies on a given network , we study synchrony - optimized networks resulting for the problem of optimizing natural frequencies on the network . <n> [ sec1]theorem [ sec2]lemma [ sec3]corollary [ sec4]proposition [ sec5]remark [ sec6]assumption [ sec7]definition [ sec8]example the frequency of a harmonic oscillator is the amplitude of its oscillations . in the classical theory of oscillators @xcite ,<n> the natural frequency is the sum of the amplitudes of all the oscillators in the system ; however , in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in studying the properties of natural frequencies , especially in the context of networks we investigate the properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators , where each oscillator s natural frequency @xmath0 represents the frequency of the oscillators that it influences .<n> we find that in directed networks , there is a strong  bow - tie''-like structure in the relationships between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators and between the mean frequencies of oscillators along in - coming and out - going links , which is reminiscent of the frequency - frequency relationship that we previously observed for undirected networks . in the directed case ,<n> we observe that oscillators whose natural frequency shares their sign with the frequencies opposite incoming and outgoing links are more likely to be located in the respective corners of the network . <n> directed networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology @xcite . yet , despite their ubiquity , it is not clear how to construct directed networks that maximize the number of connections and at the same time minimize the amount of resources required to connect them . here , we show that it is possible to design directed networks with desirable properties , such as low resource consumption and minimal dissipation , by connecting oscillators with frequencies that are mutually related . using an example of a directed network of coupled nonlinear oscillators synchronization is essential for the functioning of a wide range of systems , from cell automata to the internet . here , we study the role of oscillator arrangement on synchronization in directed networks .<n> we find that the optimal arrangement of oscillators in a network strongly depends on the correlation between the frequencies of both incoming and outgoing links , as well as on the correlations between the in- and out - degrees of the oscillators , suggesting that these correlations play an important role in the evolution of a network s synchronization properties . <n> the ability of a system to perform its task with high speed and accuracy is a consequence of the diversity of physical , chemical , and biological processes that occur on a daily basis @xcite . in order to effectively perform these tasks ,<n> it is essential to understand how a system s properties evolve as the system evolves . for example , it is important for a cell to be able to respond to changing environmental conditions , such as temperature , pressure , or strain , by adapting its physical and chemical properties ; it is also essential for a computer to perform distributed processing tasks such as file transfer , file storage , communication , etc . as a result , we present a general framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators . our theoretical result is the derivation of a generalized synchrony alignment function , which we have shown can be used to systematically optimize the synchrony properties of networks under several constraints , including oscillator allocation , oscillator arrangement , and network construction .<n> this approach does not require large - scale simulation of dynamics and is based on an objective measure of synchronization . <n> synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in many natural and technological systems . in particular ,<n> the synchronization of electrical circuits @xcite and optical networks is essential for many applications , such as high - speed internet communication @xmath0 , high - resolution optical imaging with integrated optical components @xxcite , as well as high precision metrology @x<n> . however , the underlying dynamical mechanisms of synchronization are not well understood . to this end , there has been much recent work on the optimization of the degree - frequency correlations and the frequency - frequency correlation observed in optimally rewired networks . here , we present an approach for systematically optimizing the synchronized state of a directed network of coupled nonlinear oscillators under various constraints . using a perturbation analysis of the kuramoto order we present a new approach to the construction of networks of coupled oscillators that maximizes the kuramoto order parameter , an objective measure of synchronization .<n> this approach does not require large - scale simulation , and is designed to work in the regime where strong synchronization may occur . in particular , stronger synchronization is attained as the natural frequency vector becomes aligned with dominant singular vectors , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values . to provide further insight into the mechanisms that enhance synchronization and the role of directedness , we investigated the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization , the properties that optimization has on directed network structures . we have found a contrasting phenomenon for directed networks : after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity in the frequency distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees . <n> we have also studied the relationship between structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks . we study the synchronization properties of directed networks that are optimized for synchronization . we find that after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneous of the frequency distribution , while no such relationship was found for the out - degrees .<n> we have also studied the relationship between structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks . in the undirected case , it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization ; synchronization is promoted by these relationships become more nuanced in the directed case . <n> we also studied correlations between the natural frequencies of neighbors and found that directed synchrony - optimized networks display a stronger relationship between each natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links than their neighbors along out - going links . taken together , these results indicate that in - degrees play a significant role in the synchronization characteristics ofdirected networks , whereas out - degree are much less significant . synchronization is one of the most important concepts in nonlinear science , yet it is notoriously difficult to understand in a quantitative manner the properties of networks that optimize synchronization , i.e. , synchrony , in a directed network . to we study the dynamics of a nonlinear clock with a periodic gaussian phase shift in the presence of a chaotic background field .<n> we find that the phase of the clock can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of the phase shift , and that the clock is always in a state of maximum oscillatory stability . <n> the study of chaotic systems is an active field of research @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the dynamical properties of nonlinear systems , with the aim of understanding such properties in terms of the underlying dynamics of the system . for example , in the context of quantum mechanics , it has been shown that the system is chaotic if and only if the hamiltonian @xmath0 is non - zero , that is , if and when hamilton s equations of motion are non - linear . on the other hand ,<n> nonlinear systems are also known to be chaotic in general , including when they are chaotic with respect to a periodic phase shift ( psw ) , which is the case in most of the physical , chemical , biological , as well as technological chaotic systems . here<n> we focus on the problem of turbulence is ubiquitous in nature and engineering . yet<n> , little is known about the properties of turbulence in the thermodynamic limit . here<n> we study the thermodynamics of a system of @xmath0 particles in a periodic box .<n> we find that turbulence can be described by a generalized kuramoto law , which states that the average velocity of the particles in the box is given by the linear speed of sound in the bulk of the system , and that the tails of the velocity distribution function follow a power - law with an exponent that depends on the number of particles . <n> [ [ section ] ] turbulence plays an important role in many natural and engineering systems , ranging from the interstellar medium ( ism ) to the earth s atmosphere @xcite , as well as in engineering processes such as the production of femtosecond laser pulses in plasmas @x<n> . however , there is no consensus about the nature of turbulence , despite its ubiquity in nature , engineering , medicine , biology and physics . in this letter , we will focus on the thermodynamic properties of a turbulent system in the presence of an external driving field . we will show that the turbulence is characterized by a we study the dynamics of a self - gravitating scalar field in a @xmath0-dimensional three - dimensional minkowski spacetime , in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we find that the field can induce a non - equilibrium phase transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic fluid . in the latter case ,<n> the system is able to self - organize into a fluid - like state , which is characterized by a large number of meta - stable states . <n> the study of equilibrium states of many - body systems is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical physics . due to the complexity of the system , equilibrium states<n> are often approximated by solutions of classical equations of motion . however , this approximation breaks down when the system size grows beyond a critical size , i.e. , when the number of degrees of freedom becomes large enough . as a result , the system can not reach its full thermodynamical equilibrium , and equilibrium states are no longer well - defined . on the other hand , it is well - known that a finite number of particles can be in equilibrium with the system at any given time . for a long time<n> , numerical simulations have been used we study the dynamics of the ben - israel - grenville ( ber ) @xmath0 model on the simple cubic lattice .<n> the model describes a system of spinless fermions interacting via the coulomb repulsion . using the sakaguchi - kuramoto ( sk ) perturbation theory ,<n> we show that the ber model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the coupling constant . at the transition<n> , the ground state energy of the model is the same as that of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) ising model , with the same critical exponent , but the critical exponent of the two - body repulsion is different . <n> _ introduction : _ the besov - bohm ( bb ) model @xcite is one of the simplest , non - perturbative , models of interacting spin systems . in 1d<n> it describes a 1d ising system interacting with a constant magnetic field , which can be a spin-1/2 particle , a spin-1 electron , or a neutral particle . on the other hand , in 2d it describes an interacting system of interacting bosons we consider the bekessy - bessy - komlos ( bkm ) model of spinless fermions interacting via the coulomb repulsion .<n> we show that this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath0 , below which the ground state of the system is a spin liquid . in this phase ,<n> the spins of the interacting system are in one - to - one correspondence with their antiparticles . <n> the bkm model @xcite is one of the simplest quantum field theories , which has been extensively studied in the context of high - temperature superconductivity , condensed matter physics , and elementary particle physics . at low temperatures , the model reduces to the non - interacting ising model ( nidm ) in the limit of vanishing coupling , where the spin degrees of freedom are described by the spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian . as a result , in the large-@xmath1 limit , this model is equivalent to the spinless ising chain in a transverse magnetic field , with the ising interaction acting as the effective magnetic field for the spins . the spin system is described by a",

transported nearest neighbors , which is introduced here for the first time . as an application , we study the energy density , the magnetic susceptibility and the topological charge density . <n> pacs numbers : 11.15.ha , 12.38.gc , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn in the last few years , hybrid lattice simulations have gained a lot of attention , both for theoretical and numerical reasons @xcite . in particular , it has become clear that simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on a lattice , where the gauge fields are treated as classical particles , are a very useful tool to study the qcd phase diagram in the strong coupling regime . on the other hand , simulations of lattice gauge theories , such as the su(2 ) yang - mills theory ( ssm ) , have also been carried out on the same type of gauge fields , but in a non - chiral gauge theory , like the su(n ) we present hybrid monte carlo simulations of the @xmath0 symmetric spin-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice .<n> the spins are updated by introducing conjugate momenta and solving classical equations of motion associated with the hamiltonian . the spin - spin and spin - lattice couplings<n> are treated in the same way as the couplings between the spins and the plaquettes are treated . <n> topological charge @xcite is one of the most important observables in condensed matter physics . in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it is the quantity that distinguishes the different phases of the system , such as the paramagnetic ( pm ) and the superconducting ( ss ) phases , from the mott insulator phase , which is realized in qcd at low temperatures . at the same time , in condensed - matter systems , the topology of the phase diagram plays an important role , as it determines the nature of the ground state and the low - energy excitations . for a mott - hubbard model ,<n> the topological charge is the only quantity that can distinguish the two phases . on the other hand , for a we present a method for the field trivialization in quantum field theory .<n> the method is based on the equivalence between the partition function and the solution of the equations of motion in field space . as an example , we apply the method to the one - dimensional ising model . <n> field theory is the foundation of our understanding of physics . in classical mechanics ,<n> the action of the variables is given by the action functional of the hamiltonian . for quantum systems , however , this functional is not always the same as the action given in the classical formalism , because of the non - local nature of the interaction of the quantum fields with the matter field . to solve this problem<n> , one has to solve the field equations in the presence of additional constraints , such as a constraint on the momentum of the fields or a constraint in the form of an energy constraint . the trivialization of field theory has been a subject of intense research @xcite . among the different trivialization schemes , the method of the field <n> trivialization ( fpt ) is the most widely used . here , fpt is defined in the context of quantum mechanics as @xmath0 where @x we present an extension of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm for simulating molecular dynamics .<n> the new algorithm is based on a field trivialization procedure in field space , which allows us to perform the hmc simulation in an efficient way . as an application , we study the dynamics of the alanine dipeptide in the presence of a repulsive force . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) is one of the most important tools in the study of proteins @xcite . in particular ,<n> the development of efficient algorithms for the simulation of molecular dynamics is of great importance , both for the experimentalists and also for the theorists who wish to study the properties of proteins in their active state . among the different methods that have been proposed for this purpose , <n> the most promising ones are the parallel tempering of coarse - grained molecular dynamics codes and the recently introduced hybrid algorithms . for the latter , the aim is to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) of the molecular dynamics by means of an efficient coarse - graining procedure , in which the time step @xmath0 is quadratic in the number of degrees of freedom of the evolving molecular system . we present a numerical method for the field transformation of the hamiltonian on the two - dimensional sphere .<n> the method is based on a trivializing map , which allows us to perform the transformation in a fast and efficient way . as an application , we compute the critical force @xmath0 and the phase diagram for the ising model on the simple cubic lattice . <n> field transformations play an important role in many areas of physics @xcite . in nuclear physics , for example , field - transformation methods have been used to solve the klein - gordon equation in the limit of zero external force , see e.g. refs . [ eq : klein- gordon ] and references therein . for classical systems , such as the isotropic heisenberg model on a lattice , transformation methods based on trivializing maps<n> have been widely used . however , these methods suffer from the problem of large step - size updates , and it is not clear if they can be applied to more complex systems . on the other hand , it is well known that field transformation methods can be used to compute the phase diagrams of non - integrable systems in the large- we study the leading order trivialization of the cp@xmath0model by means of the hmc algorithm .<n> we find an improvement of more than an order of magnitude when compared to the literature . <n> numerical simulation of lattice quantum field theories is a notoriously difficult task . in recent years<n> , it has even been considered even more difficult to simulate non - perturbative theories such as the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , the @xmath1 model of high - temperature superconductivity ( hyperconductivity ) , and the qcd - improved wilson ( wc ) theory of the ising - like chiral spin glass ( icsg ) with the xxz spin chain . for the latter ,<n> a numerical simulation has to be done in a finite number of steps , where each step is similar to a finite step - size update of the hamiltonian , or equivalently , an euler transformation of the lattice variables . on the other hand , in the field - theoretic setting , one only has to perform a finite set of transformations in the variables of interest , starting from an initial state in which all spins are we use the heuristic monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm to study the effect of a field transformation on the phase diagram of the cp@xmath0model .<n> we find that , in general , the phase boundary is shifted in the same direction as in the non - interacting case , and that the critical exponents of the ising universality class change . in the presence of strong correlations , however , it is not possible to identify the exact critical point . <n> the study of phase transitions in condensed matter systems is one of the central problems in statistical mechanics . for a long time ,<n> the interest in such problems has been mainly concentrated on the isotropic heisenberg model @xcite , where the transition is of first order and the critical properties are well understood . recently , there has been an increasing interest in non - ising models , which are more closely related to the @xmath1 universality class than to the iso - spin models . among the models that have been studied in this context<n> are the isochoric spin chain ( isc ) , a lattice version of which has been recently proposed as a model for the critical behavior of ising spin we have developed a hybrid monte carlo algorithm , which is capable of simulating the dynamics of complex many - body quantum systems .<n> the algorithm is based on the exact diagonalization of a set of coupled schrdinger equations in the presence of a field transformation . with this algorithm<n> , we have investigated the topological phase transitions in a model of a spinless fermion interacting with an anharmonic oscillator . for the topological superconducting phase transition in the @xmath0 model ,<n> we find that the autocorrelation times are significantly reduced with respect to the non - topological phase transition . <n> topological superconductors ( ts ) are a class of quantum matter in which the topology of the superconducting order parameter plays a crucial role @xcite . in these systems<n> the fermionic nature of the cooper pairs is protected by topology , and the cooper pair condensate ( cp@xmath1 ) is a well known example . however , in real physical systems , such as topological insulators ( ti ) , it is not possible to have a superconductor in the bulk of the material , because of the strong , long - range interactions between cooper pairs . also , the we present a numerical study of the topological properties of the @xmath0 qcd ground state .<n> we compare the results of a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) approach with a perturbative approach including a field transformation . in the hmc approach<n> the topological charge can profit from a longer trajectory length , whereas in the field transformation it is affected by a shorter one . for observables like the energy or the magnetic susceptibility ,<n> the latter can even profit from longer trajectories . <n> the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the thermodynamic limit is a long standing goal in theoretical physics . since the seminal work of feynman @xcite , qcd has been applied successfully to a wide range of problems , from condensed matter to high energy physics , where it is possible to solve the problem with high accuracy . at the heart of qcd<n> is the problem of the confinement of the many body hamiltonian , which is the object of much current research . due to the large dynamical range of the problem<n> , it is also possible to study the behavior of the system close to the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , well away from it  we study the effect of trivializing flows on the molecular dynamics evolution of a dna hairpin . to this end<n> , we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a hybrid monte carlo method ( hmc ) and a time - dependent , two - dimensional , highly accurate numerical scheme , the thmc .<n> we find that the trivializing flow results in an overall reduction of the forces experienced by the hairpin , which is not dramatically different from the force in hmc or in the standard , short - time , hmc simulations . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) is one of the most active field of research in biology , chemistry and physics , because of its potential to reveal the nature of living cells @xcite . in md ,<n> a sequence of dna molecules is sequenced step by step , starting from an uncondensed single dna monomer ( s - dna ) , through a double - stranded dna molecule , to a hairpin molecule and then back to the uncondensded state , depending on the sequence and the environment . during the sequence , molecules undergo a series of steps , such as binding , cleavage , translation we propose a hybrid monte carlo method , the thmc , to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation of molecular dynamics .<n> the method is based on the continuous integration of the hamiltonian and is capable of simulating the time evolution of molecular systems with high accuracy . as an example<n> , we apply the method to calculate the force experienced by the chromatin protein ( cp ) in its quiescent and in its prokaryotic states . in the quiescent state ,<n> the force is reduced by about 60% with respect to the exact solution , while in the prokaryote state it is almost constant , at least in the case of the cp@xmath0 model . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) is one of the most active field of research in biology , because of its potential applications in the design of new and improved drugs and devices , as well as in the investigation of the internal workings of living cells @xcite . to study the properties of these systems , different methods have been developed , such as molecular dynamics simulations ( mds ) , direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and hybrid methods ( thm ) @x we investigate the effect of a field transformation on autocorrelation times in molecular dynamics simulations of a simple model for protein folding . to this end<n> , we introduce a simple force criterion , which is supposed to reduce autocorrelations .<n> we find that the force criterion is indeed able to reduce the autocorrelation time , but only for observables that are not dominated by the force minimum . <n> protein folding is a complex biological process in which self - assembly of a signaling network takes place via a sequence of single - molecule reactions @xcite . in order to obtain a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ,<n> a sufficient number of molecules have to be assembled before a single reaction can take place , a process known as folding of a protein ( or a group of proteins ) can not take place without some form of interaction with the surrounding environment , e.g. a thermal bath , an external electric field , or an applied strain . as a consequence , the rate at which a single molecule assembles in a single step of the folding process is limited by the reaction rate , known as the force , @xmath0 , of the reaction . for a given value of the force @ we present a hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc - thmc ) for the calculation of autocorrelation times of stochastic processes .<n> the algorithm is based on the metropolis algorithm , where the force criterion is reduced from the force minimum in order to increase the acceptance rate of the hmc algorithm . in our implementation<n> , we find that the autocorrelation time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the standard hmc , depending on the observable . <n> stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics and biology , being central to the functioning of living cells and tissues , as well as for technological applications . despite their importance ,<n> molecular dynamics ( md ) methods are still not widely used to simulate stochastic processes due to the computational cost and the complexity of the md algorithms @xcite . as a consequence , in the last years , there has been an increasing interest in the use of stochastic methods for the simulation of complex biological processes , see , e.g. , refs . and references therein . for example , stochastic landau - zener ( s zener ) models , which are a generalization of the well - known keldy we present a hybrid monte carlo algorithm for the simulation of lattice hamiltonians with a field transformation .<n> the algorithm is based on the metropolis algorithm , where the trivializing flow is transformed by a metropolis acceptance rate , which is controlled by the integration length of the molecular dynamics trajectory . as a result<n> , we find that the critical slowing down of the simulations is strongly reduced by the field transformation and that the autocorrelation times of various observables grow exponentially with the correlation length . <n> _ introduction. _ <n> the study of the dynamical properties of many - body hamiltonian systems is one of the most important topics in statistical mechanics . in recent years<n> this field has experienced a rapid growth , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . due to the availability of powerful numerical techniques ,<n> it has become possible to simulate large systems with high accuracy . among them<n> is the _ metropolis _<n> ( hmc ) algorithm @xmath0 , introduced in ref . [ eq : hmc algorithm ] . here<n> we present an extension of this algorithm to the case of a lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , a hamilton we present high - resolution measurements of the topological susceptibility in the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice .<n> the data were obtained with a high - statistics hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm , which we use to extract the topological charge , the magnetic susceptibility , and the spin - spin correlation length . <n> _ introduction. _<n> topological insulators ( tis ) are a new state of quantum matter with topologically protected gapless surface states @xcite . in these materials ,<n> the topological invariants are protected by time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , but not by spatial inversion symmetry ( sus ) which is usually assumed to hold in condensed matter systems . however , it has been suggested that trs might not hold in topological insulators , because the trs of the tis is different from that of the trivial ising model @x<n> . this might be due to the presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum of the system , or to the fact that there is a non - trivial topology in the wave function of the fermions . here<n> , we report on a study of the we present results from a quantum monte carlo study of the @xmath0 hubbard model in two dimensions .<n> the time - dependent density of states , the magnetic susceptibility and the correlation length are measured and compared to analytical results and to the results of a finite - size scaling analysis . in the topological sector , we find that the autocorrelation time of the topological charge is much longer than that of the other observables , indicating the presence of a very slow mode in the model . <n> _ introduction. _ the study of interacting quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . due to the complexity of the problem ,<n> it has been difficult to devise methods that could be applied to a wide range of physical systems . for example , in the context of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , perturbative methods are inadequate . on the other hand , numerical techniques have been developed that allow one to study the behavior of interacting models in the thermodynamic limit . among these methods<n> are the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and green s function ( gf ) . as such<n> , they have been we present results from a high - statistics monte carlo ( hmc ) simulation of the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model on the square lattice .<n> we find that the autocorrelation time of the correlation function of the magnetic susceptibility is @math2 , which is significantly shorter than the usual exponential behavior . for the correlation length<n> , we find a slower behavior , with a time constant of @xcite . <n> _ introduction. _ the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in condensed matter physics ,<n> it is of crucial importance to understand the mechanisms which lead to the formation of quantum phases of matter . among the various approaches to this goal , monte - carlo methods@xcite have proven to be very successful in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems . however , the accuracy with which these methods can be applied is limited by the fact that they are based on classical hamiltonians which do not capture the essential topological aspects of quantum mechanics , such as the non - trivial topology of the hilbert space . as a result , it has been difficult to test the predictions of classical we introduce a new method to extract the critical exponents of open quantum systems from the time evolution of a large number of observables .<n> the method is based on a field transformation of the hamiltonian , which is performed by a hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc ) and a time - dependent metropolis algorithm ( thmc , monte - carlo for short ) . <n> we apply the method to the topology and the magnetic susceptibility of the quantum ising model on a square lattice with a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath0 , and we compare the results with those obtained by a perturbative approach and by the hmc algorithm . in the last years<n> , quantum systems have attracted a lot of interest due to their experimental accessibility and potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite . for a given quantum system ,<n> the time - evolution of many observables is an important quantity which can be used to characterize the state of the system . from this perspective , it is of great interest to extract , from experiments or simulations , the critical behavior of a quantum system in the thermodynamic limit . on the one hand , this information is essential for the construction of quantum algorithms we study the performance of a recently proposed field transformation of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm in the topological charge sector of qcd .<n> we observe a 40% reduction in the autocorrelation time of the magnetic susceptibility , the correlation length , and the topological susceptibility for @xmath0 , but the scaling towards the continuum limit is not improved . for the observables up to a correlation length of 12 ,<n> the field transformation does not lead to a significant improvement of the algorithm . on the other hand<n> , we find a reduction in autocorrelation times , which is compensated by the computational overhead of the method . <n> the hmc algorithm @xcite has become a standard tool for the simulation of quantum field theories with dynamical fermions , e.g. , in lattice qcd @x<n> . however , it has also been shown to be inadequate for the calculation of observables of strongly correlated qcd theories , such as the critical point ( cp ) or the topological phase ( tpt ) . in particular , for observables which are sensitive to the topology of the qcd vacuum , like the susceptibility or the charge , hmc we investigate the effect of the topological charge on the autocorrelation functions of the @xmath0 channel of the hmc algorithm in the quenched approximation .<n> we find that the correlation length of the exponentially slow mode increases towards the continuum limit , which is in contrast to the scaling behavior observed in other channels . <n> qcd with dynamical fermions , e.g. , the dynamical quark mass , has a non - trivial topological charge . in the topological phase@xcite ,<n> the quark propagator and the chiral condensate are non - vanishing , while the chiral anomaly and the topological susceptibility are both negative . as a consequence , in the chiral limit<n> the theory is described by the chiral lagrangian , whereas in the unquenched limit the theory reduces to the standard qcd . at the same time<n> , there is a phase transition from the chirally symmetric phase to the deconfined phase at a critical value of the chiral parameter . for the description of the qcd phase diagram , it is therefore of interest to investigate the influence of the phase transition on the observables of the theory . to this end , one has to go beyond",

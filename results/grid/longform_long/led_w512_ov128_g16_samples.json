. as a specific example , we consider the @xmath381 combination of the proton wavefunction , which can be written as @xmath382 where @xmath88 is the normalization constant and @xmath383 is the

@xmath395 which forms the total spin ( @xmath396 ) with the meson spin @xmath397 , then @xmath137 can be either @xmath398 or @xmath399 . for the @xmath400 configuration , we distinguish the two by representing @xmath400 and @xmath401 for @xmath372 ^ 1 $ ] cluster with @xmath402 and @xmath403 , respectively , which leads us to @xmath404 note that the recoupling coefficient between the @xmath405 and @xmath406 is zero because of the structure of the spin - flavor wavefunctions .    for internal wavefunctions of the clusters , we use the @xmath407 configuration , which read 418 finally , using the above informations , we get    [ res1 ] @xmath419    for numerical calculations , we use the @xmath420 of the cloudy bag model , which read    @xmath421    where @xmath422 is the meson mass and the constants @xmath423,@xmath424 are fixed by the relations @xcite , @xmath425 with @xmath426 and @xmath427 here , @xmath428 is the normalization constant of the bag , @xmath429 the meson decay constant , and @xmath430 the eigenfrequency of the bag with spherical bessel functions @xmath431 and @xmath432 .    using the radial wavefunction of ( [ meson_wf ] ) , we can obtain the numerical results for each cluster in @xmath433 of ( [ psi5q ] ) , which leads to the probabilities of each cluster in @xmath433 of ( [ psi5q ] ) as @xmath434    we also carried out the calculations for other

when we consider only the pseudoscalar meson cloud in chiral bag model . therefore , to get more accurate value for @xmath360 , it is necessary to know the probabilities and radial wavefunctions of the vector meson cloud . inclusion of vector meson degrees of freedom in chiral bag , however , is still incomplete @xcite . in this model , we re - estimated the @xmath3 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xmath1-@xmath2 cluster model . our calculation is based on the rhom which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction . in this model , we re - estimated the @xmath3 meson electroproduction from a proton target in nrqm . in this model , we re - estimated the @xmath3 meson electroproduction from

sections for the @xmath2-knockout and diffractive contributions . practitionthe cross sections of the rhom are enhanced compared with the nrqm ones by an order of magnitude . as in nrqm , we could find that the main contribution of the amplitudes is from the magnetic part of the current . embodimentswe also found that the @xmath70-dependence of the cross section of @xmath1 knockout is different from those of @xmath2 knockout and vdm . embodimentsthis strong difference may be useful in determining the ratio @xmath452 of eq . embodimentsthis strong difference may be checked in future experiments at cebaf .     finally , we examined the strangeness coefficients of the proton wavefunction in quark model using the cloudy bag model predictions on the meson clouds . embodimentswe found that the amplitude @xmath359 is nearly equal to the amplitude of the @xmath41 meson cloud in the proton wavefunction , which is predicted as less than 0.5% in the cloudy bag model . embodimentswe can

fit radius of the arc has a de - projected physical size of 0.3pc , which falls between values for the inner and outer tori of the pulsar . the best - fit radius of the arc , which falls between values for the pulsar @xcite , is a reasonable value for a young pwn .the fitting results also indicate a substantial flux contribution from the compact nebula , and that the northern clump is brighter than the southern one .the fitting results also indicate a substantial flux contribution from the compact nebula , and that the northern clump is brighter than the southern one .the fitting results also indicate a substantial flux contribution from the compact nebula .given the inclination of the pulsar spin axis determined by the fit , a simple picture of doppler boosted jets predicts the southern clump to be brighter than the northern one , which is clearly inconsistent with the results .the 2006 exposure was started 7 days after the first burst reported by @xcite and no bursts have occurred during the observation . the pulsar lightcurve shows no short - term variability in and between the four individual exposures . the background estimate .ghostwe tried independent measurements for the northeast and southwest trails , as well as for each individual exposure , and the results are all consistent . since the readout trail consists of not only counts from the pulsar , but also those from the pwn and snr background in the same columns , the latter have to be subtracted out . excluding the central 3  radius from the pulsar , there are @xmath28 total counts ( 1 - 8kev range ) in a 3  wide rectangular region covering the whole trail of 600 ccd pixels in length .ghostof these counts , the above estimate suggests that only @xmath29 counts are from the readout artifact and the rest are real events from the pwn , snr and background .ghosttherefore , for a frame time of 1.8s , the pwn and snr contribute a total of @xmath30ctsrow@xmath7 to the readout trail , implying an unpiled count rate of @xmath31ctss@xmath7 for the pulsar in 1 - 8kev range .ghostnote that this is only an upper limit of the true pulsar flux , due to the contamination by the surrounding compact nebula .ghostthis is - 8kev band for the first and second epochs respectively . suburthe 3% difference is entirely due to the scattering of pulsar counts in the same field - of - view . suburwe generated a model psf without any pile - up effects , and found that the above region contains 3.5% of the point source counts . suburtherefore , the increase in the pulsar luminosity can easily explain the excess counts in the pwn.ctss@xmath7 ]    on the other hand , some small - scale features in the pwn do demonstrate significant variability between the observations . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . subur[ f4 ] clearly show the evolution of the northern clump and the brightening of the southern inner jet . in the 2006 data , the northern clump broadens and the southern inner jet narrows , while the northern clump broadens and the southern inner jet narrows . suburshows a double peak feature . suburthe count profiles in fig . suburthe count profiles in fig . suburthe southern inner jet also shows hints of morphological evolution : there is an obvious eastern extension at the end of the jet in the 2006 exposure , but it seems to be absent indices . suburcareful examination of each spectrum shows no spectral or flux variation between the exposures in the 2006 observation . suburthe best -

up effects . suburagain , for the 2006 observation , the spectra were extracted from individual exposure and then fitted jointly . suburwe did not attempt to fit the column density , as this could be complicated by the pile - up effects and by any possible thermal emission from the pulsar . suburinstead , it was fixed at the pwn value @xmath39@xmath35 in the analysis . suburalso , due to contamination from the surrounding compact nebula , a simple background subtraction with an annuli region may lead to inaccurate pile - up estimate . suburhence , we fit the source spectrum with a two - powerlaw model : one for the background and the other one for the pulsar . suburthe former is fixed at the best - fit spectrum of region 12 ( see fig . subur[ f6 ] ) and we scale its amplitude according to the spatial modeling in  [ s31 ] . suburwe found that the compact nebula provides 0.05ctss@xmath7 ( 1 -

10kev energy range .in the 0.5 - 10kev energy range .at a distance of 6kpc , the overall pwn has a radius @xmath51pc and an x - ray luminosity @xmath52ergss@xmath7 in the 0.5 - 10kev band .in the 0.5 - 10ke detection of vhe @xmath3-rays from kes  75 provides a better handle on the magnetic field @xcite . in a one zone model assuming all the tev photons come from inverse compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the x - ray and @xmath3-ray fluxes are related to the energy densities of the magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) and the photons ( @xmath58 ) by @xmath59 where @xmath60ergs@xmath61 for the cmb . comparing our result of x - ray flux in 0.5 - 10kev band to the reported hess detection of tev flux in 0.3 - 5tev range suggests @xmath62 , which is comparable to that of g21.50.9 , implying a low magnetic field of @xmath63 g @xcite . [this picture is further supported by the similar radio and x - ray pwn sizes . as compared to the radio images from the vla and the bima array, the x - ray synchrotron emission extends nearly to the edge of the radio counterpart @xcite . [this suggests a long synchrotron cooling time scale and hence a of pwn evolution within an expanding snr suggest that during the first @xmath67 years , a pwn expands freely into the surrounding ejecta before the supernova reverse shock is reached ( e.g. * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ). given the young age of kes  75 , the pwn is likely to be in the free expansion phase .   the expansion of light pulsar wind materials into the dense supernova ejecta could result in rayleigh - taylor instabilities .   this may be associated to the protrusions in the pwn boundary , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula @xcite .   alternatively , the protrusions in the north could also due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn . although a comparison to optical observations will help to identify the nature of these structures, this may not be observationally feasible due to the large distance of the source and its location on the galactic plane . a latitude dependence of @xmath74 ) . in this picture , the inferred pressure for our pwn is @xmath75dyne@xmath35 , consistent with the magnetic pressure inside the nebula . in this picture , the inferred pressure for our pwn is @xmath75dne@xmath35 , consistent with the magnetic pressure inside the nebula . in this picture ,this is also in a general agreement with the numerical simulations of a generic young pwn evolving in a snr @xcite . comparing to the thermal pressure in the snr limbs @xcite , this value is @xmath76 times lower , confirming that the supernova reverse shock has not yet reached the pwn and that most of the ejecta in the snr interior are still cold .    in general, we do not expect any significant synchrotron emission inside the termination shock . in this case , the compact nebula surrounding the pulsar could be a result of particle injection from previous outbursts . the synchrotron cooling timescale for a particle emitting at @xmath77kev in the nebula is @xmath78 if an outburst occurs every decade , as suggested by @xcite , then based on the timescale this indicates a different physical origin of the arc than the crab nebula s bright outer torus , where most x - ray emitting particles lose their energy . this is a result of synchrotron burn - off and nebula expansion . this is a result of synchrotron burn - off and nebula expansion .this is a result of synchrotron burn -

fit inclination angle @xmath85 and the photon index @xmath86 for the jet , the detection limit on the counter jet sets its minimum bulk velocity @xmath87 .this is comparable to jets in other pulsars such as the crab , vela and b150958 @xcite . to estimate the magnetic field in the jet , we approximate the southern inner jet by a cylinder with 1.5  diameter and a length of @xmath88 , which correspond to 0.04 and 0.1pc respectively at 6kpc .from the best - fit spectral luminosity @xmath89ergss@xmath7kev@xmath7 at 5kev suggests an equipartition field @xmath90 g with a total energy @xmath91ergs for the inner jet , where @xmath92 is the ion to electron energy and @xmath93 is the filling factor ( see * ? ? ? ? ).the synchrotron cooling time for particles emitting at 5kev in the jet is then @xmath94yr , confirming that @xmath95yr .this also the angle between the direction of motion and the observer line of sight . as @xmath100 , this places an upper limit @xmath101 .the best - fit pulsar spin axis inclination @xmath102 indicates that the observed variability in the jet could not be explained by any superluminal motion in the polar outflow . for any emission in a random direction that beamed towards the earth with @xmath103 , there is an additional constraint for the alignment with the jet direction on the plane of the sky .the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @xmath103 .the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @xmath104 .given the two epochs separate by 6 years , we could not distinguish whether the inner jet variability is due to mhd instability as is possibly so in the cases of vela and psr b150958 jets @xcite , or simply due to the recent bursts . a similar argument also applies to the northern clump . due to the strong magnetic field and compact size of the inner jet , the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @x similar spectral indices of the two clumps hint that the emission may come from the same physical process , but their relative brightness suggests that they could not be simply reconciled as doppler boosted jets .the clumps are likely to be non - thermal .it is possible that the clumps are results of non - thermal emission from the shock interaction between the polar outflow and the ambient medium . when the supersonic pulsar jets encounter the supernova ejecta , the density gradient results in a bow shock and leads to strong x - ray emission . the pwn near the southern clump provides some evidence of such a density gradient and this likely results in the clump .the pwn near the southern clump provides some evidence of such a density gradient and this likely results in the clump .the pwn near the southern clump provides some evidence of such a density gradient and this likely results in the clump .the one in the north is less obvious , which could be due to projection effects . comparing to other pwn systems, a similar scenario has been proposed to associate the x - ray features in rcw  89 with psr b150958 @xcite .the difference in our case is that the clumps are found on both sides and the variability of the northern clump can be attributed to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , as the jet expands into the much denser ejecta .the luminosity of the northern clump is @xmath105 , which can be easily powered by the jets , and the flow time scale @xmath106yr is substantially shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr , which is much shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr , which is substantially shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr , which is substantially shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr . therefore the particles are still energetic on reaching the edge of the pwn . thefuture multi - wavelength observations , in particular high resolution radio maps of the pwn could help to further investigate the nature of the clumps .the best - fit pulsar spectrum for the second epoch indicates a @xmath48 flux contribution from the blackbody component , which is not observed in the 2000 data .the best - fit pulsar spectrum for the second epoch indicates a @xmath48 flux contribution from the blackbody component , which is not observed in the 2000 data .this suggests that the thermal emission is likely xcite . suburour results indicate that the x - ray properties of psr j18460258 in quiescence are not much different from an ordinary young neutron star s . suburas compared to the crab pulsar , psr j18460258 has a higher surface magnetic field but its nebular field is much weaker . suburthis seems to imply no direct correlation between the magnetic field strengths on a neutron star surface and in its surrounding pwn . suburalthough the exact nature of the arc - like feature remains unknown , in either the equatorial torus or equatorial wisp interpretation , the pulsar spin orientation can still be inferred from the spatial modeling . subur@xcite propose a scenario in which the angle between the spin and magnetic axis is @xmath113 in order to explain the pulsar s braking index in terms of the vacuum - dipole model @xcite . suburif this is real , then the spin inclination @xmath114 obtained from the torus fitting indicates a magnetic inclination @xmath115 . suburthe large @xmath25 is consistent with the non - detection of radio pulsations . suburthis picture also predicts that no pulsed @xmath3-rays will be observable according to the @xcite model . suburfuture gl xmath118 to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle @xmath119 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the spatially resolved spectrum of the pwn shows that regions along the jet direction have systematically harder spectrum than the surroundings , suggesting a high velocity in the polar outflow .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also deduce a minimum flow velocity of 0.4@xmath1 based on the non - detection of a counter jet .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there are two bright clumps aligned with the jet , which we propose due to bow shocks of the polar outflow in the supernova ejecta . over a period of 6 years, the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability , which could be attributed to mhd instabilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\accompanying the recent outburst , the pulsar luminosity has increased by 6 times and shows substantial softening in the spectrum .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also find an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , which could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the 2000 observation suggests a pulsar x -

limited systems or , alternatively , to reduce the asn . embodimentsthe adoption of sequential procedures , however , poses some difficulties : since the instant when the procedure stops sampling is not determined in advance ( it is a random stopping time , indeed ) the set of trajectories of the dynamic system to be considered ( i.e. the parameter space . observations . practitionhowever , all of these studies were restricted to a finite cardinality of the parameter space , an overly restrictive condition , which corresponds to requiring that the dynamic system may only lie in a determined state , with no transition allowed . practitionfew works in the past have studied sequential problems for hidden markov models ( hmms ) , which are known to admit a dynamical system representation in the sense of control theory @xcite . in @xcite the performances of sprts for model estimation in parametrized hmms and the cumulative sum ( cusum ) procedure for change point detection in hmms are studied , while @xcite addresses the quickest detection of transient signals represented as hmms using a cusum - like procedure , with possible applications to the radar framework . practitionthis paper addresses the problem of sequential detection and trajectory estimation of the state evolution of a dynamical system observed through noisy measurements . in the above framework , it is known that wald s sprt for the detection part of the detection part of the detection part is given and sufficient conditions under which these properties are stated , consistent with previous results in @xcite . in the above framework , it is known that wald s sprt for the detection part these properties hold are stated , consistent with previous results in @xcite . in particular , it is shown that under a set of rather mild conditions the test ends with probability one and its stopping time is almost surely minimized in the class of tests with the same or smaller error probabilities . furthermore , under a set of rather mild conditions , the test ends with probability one and its stopping time is almost surely minimized in the class of tests with the same or smaller error probabilities . furthermore , reinforcing one of such conditions , it is also shown that any moment of the stopping time distribution is first -

      "generated": "um electrodynamics ( qed ) lies at the heart of modern quantum theory . 神qed is a well established and experimentally confirmed theory @xcite but even fifty years after its foundation many features of the atom  field interaction remain extremely intriguing . in particular , the character of the atom  field interaction can be substantially modified in _ confined spaces _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _physical _properties _ due to the fact that local properties of the electromagnetic ( em ) field depend on space boundaries . 神the radiative properties of atoms and the em field in confined spaces have been investigated for various cavity qed systems @xcite . 神quantum electrodynamics is a local theory , which means that the dynamics of atoms and electrons depend on local properties of the electromagnetic field with which they interact . 神but local properties of the electromagnetic field depend also on conditions imposed by the ( exponential decay of the excited level of the atom ) . extingthe interaction of a two level atom with discrete ( cavity ) modes has been described systematically by hamilton @xcite who solved the emission and scattering problems exactly for a cubic box by diagonalization of the total atom - field hamiltonian . extinglater this approach was utilized by other researchers for a detailed investigation of spontaneous emission of two - level atoms ( see for instance papers by davidson and kozak @xcite and swain @xcite ) . essentially , in all these papers on the spontaneous decay of a two - level atom in a cavity ( box ) , the coupling constant between the atom and the cavity modes has been taken to be position independent . extingthis argument is perfectly justifiable in free space , when translational invariance is valid . extingon the other hand , when the atom interacts with discrete cavity modes in a confined space the position dependence of the coupling can play a significant rle . extingthe investigation of this problem is not only of theoretical interest . extingrecent advances in experimental techniques have allowed one to study fundamental processes in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) @xcite and to verify various effects of the atom - field interaction in confined spaces as predicted by for example , one could ask about the influence of cavity mirrors on the dynamics of the atom and the rle of the position of the atom on the appearance of poincar recurrences ( i.e. , re - excitations of the atom by radiation reflected by the cavity mirrors ) @xcite . while the exponential character of the decay is not affected by variations of the position of the atom around the center of the cavity ( providing that the cavity is large enough ) , the poincar recurrences depend very sensitively on the position of the atom inside the cavity . nominenamely , variation of the position of the atom within a wavelength of the resonant atomic frequency can result in an almost complete suppression of the first poincar recurrence of the excited level of the atom @xcite . nominethis means that the atom effectively does not `` feel '' wave packets reflected from cavity mirrors for times much longer than the time necessary for emitted light to `` travel '' to the mirrors and back to the atom . nomineanother example concerns the atom which is positioned close to one of the mirrors . in general, the atom can `` feel '' wave packets reflected from cavity mirrors for times much longer than the time necessary for emitted light to `` travel '' to the mirrors matrix element of the corresponding transition . nominethe presence of boundaries ( e.g. , in the case when the atom is inserted into a high-@xmath0 microwave cavity ) changes the local density of field modes and thereby the spontaneous emission can be suppressed or enhanced . nominehowever , it is by no means necessary to change the boundary conditions of the em field in order to modify the spontaneous emission rate . nominethis goal can be achieved easily by the presence of other atoms which can take part in absorption and re - emission of the radiation field . nomineone important example is that of an atom embedded in a dielectric host . nominethe main task of our investigation here concerns atom - field interactions in confined geometries . starting from `` first principles '' we simulate the dynamics of a system of atoms in a cavity . nominein particular , we consider a cavity filled with a `` crystal '' composed of two  level atoms . nominewe investigate the modification of the spontaneous emission and the propagation ( scattering ) of photon wave packets within this `` crystal '' . nominethe main task of our investigation here concerns atom - field interactions in confined geometries . starting from `` first principles '' we simulate the dynamics of a system of atoms in a cavity . nominein particular , we also analyze how the dynamics of an initially excited atom is modified in the presence of other initially deexcited atoms in the cavity which play the rle of a dielectric ( see section  [ sec5 ] ) and we study in detail the time evolution of atomic populations and quantum - statistical properties of the multimode cavity field .in particular , in section  [ sec6 ] we focus our attention on the spectrum of the field .in addition we will also discuss specific technical questions such as the rle of the frequency cut - off employed here .in section  [ sec7 ] we present the convolutionless master equation describing the dynamics of the initially excited atom in dielectrics interacting with multimode cavity field .in section  [ sec7 ]we summarize our results in section  [ sec8 ] .in section  [ sec7 ]we consider a simple one - dimensional model of a cavity in which two - level atoms interact with the cavity modes in the dipole and the rotating - wave approximations . to simplify the model ,we neglect all mechanical effects of the cavity field on the atom ( i.e. , the mass of the atom is assumed to be infinite ) .in section  [ sec8 ]we summarize our results in section be expressed as @xmath15 where we have omitted the zero - point contribution @xmath16 . undensummation over discrete modes in eq.([hf ] ) is performed only up to @xmath17 , which means that in our model we assume a cutoff for the cavity modes . undenthe hamiltonian describing a set of @xmath18 non - interacting ( `` free '' ) two - level atoms with transition frequencies @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the upper and lower atomic states , respectively .    when the radius of the atom is much smaller than the wavelength of the resonant electromagnetic radiation then the atom - field interaction can be described within the electric - dipole approximation , i.e. , @xmath24 . neglecting for simplicity all polarization effects , i.e. , @xmath24 . undenthe resulting interaction hamiltonian in the rotating -

cummings model @xcite which describes the dynamics of a two - level atom interacting with a _ single_ mode cavity field . 神therefore from the very beginning our treatment will be based on a numerical simulation of the cavity qed system . 神our numerical treatment allows us to calculate properties of individual atoms and modes of the em field , i.e. , it retains a complete microscopic picture of the problem . the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) can be transformed into a set of coupled linear differential equations for the amplitudes of component states ( e.g. , basis of eigenstates of bare systems ) in a finite  dimensional subspace of the hilbert space . 神our numerical treatment allows us to calculate properties of individual atoms and modes of the em field , i. je| .physicalthe amplitude of the electric field ( r)=_n=1^n()^1/2 ( k_n r ) .physicalthe number of excitations of the @xmath35-th mode ( k)= ^_k_k , [ spec1 ] which is used to study the spectrum of the radiation . to analyze the space - time propagation of radiation wave packets we evaluate mean values of the normally - ordered operator for the energy density @xmath36 here normal ordering ( the colons above ) is adopted to eliminate the vacuum - state contribution to the energy density of the emitted radiation .    in what follows, we demonstrate the main features of the atom - field interaction in confined geometries and describe these effects : modification of spontaneous emission of the atom in the cavity due to the position dependence of the atom - field interaction .a partial re - excitation of the atom caused by the back reflected radiation ( poincar recurrences ) .decay in a `` crystal '' : modification of spontaneous emission due to the presence of other atoms , which are initially deexcited ( the decaying atom can be considered as being embedded in a dielectric `` crystal '' which is formed by other atoms ) . a model of by the fermi golden rule ( [ golden ] ) , i.e. , p_e(t)=(-_a t ) , _-a= [ decay1 ] , _-a= [ decay1 ] .in 1d `` free '' space ( @xmath37 ) the decay process is accompanied by the emission of two wave packets ( representing the one - photon state ) propagating to the left and to the right from the atom . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions in 1-d ( this corresponds to spherical symmetry in 3-d ) the emission of two wave packets propagates to the left and to the right from the atom . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions in 1-d ( this corresponds to spherical symmetry in 3-d ) the emission of two wave packets propagates to the left and to the right from the atom .when the atom is positioned at the center of the cavity it is coupled only to odd modes of the field ( for even modes the coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) is equal to zero ; for more details see below ) . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions the odd modes and thus the density of ( interacting ) modes equals to @xmath40 . embodimentsthe corresponding `` free - space '' decay rate @xmath3 is given by eq.([decay1 ] ) .    from fig . exting[ fig1 ] we see that the first `` exponential '' stage of the decay is ( almost ) position independent . providingthat the atom is `` far '' from the mirrors , i.e. , @xmath41 , the reflected wave packets do not influence the exponential decay . embodimentsmore precisely , the density of modes is doubled when the atom is shifted from the cavity center . embodimentsowing to the position dependence of the atom - field coupling ( [ lambda ] ) the even modes start to interact with the atom and the interaction with the odd modes decreases . embodimentsconsidering the effective squared interaction constant as the average for two neighboring ( odd and even ) cavity modes it decreases to the half value of the squared coupling constant of the interacting modes for the atom in the cavity center . embodimentsit means that even though the atom is shifted from the cavity center the fermi golden rule ( [ golden ] ) with the effective squared interaction constant and doubled density of modes leads to the same decay rate ( [ decay1 ] ) of the atomic decay , poincar recurrences are very sensitive to small position shifts of the atom within a wavelength of the resonant atomic transition . in fig . [ fig1 ][ fig1 ] we clearly see that if the atom is positioned at the cavity center ( @xmath44 ) then at time @xmath45 a very well pronounced poincar recurrence of the atomic inversion is seen . in other words , one can say that at the moment when the poincar recurrence appears the atom `` sees '' the cavity mirrors @xcite . in other words , one can say that at the time of appearance of the first poincar recurrence the atom `` sees '' the cavity mirrors @xcite . in other words , one can say that at the moment when the atom `` sees '' the cavity mirrors @xcite . in other words ,on the other hand , with a small shift of the atom from the cavity center to @xmath46 the first atomic recurrence is almost completely suppressed . for simplicity of the analysis,we consider the two emitted wave packets ( one to the left and one to the right ) as monochromatic plane waves ( at the atomic transition frequency and with the group velocity @xmath47 ) shift @xmath50 results from the difference of the geometrical paths which is then equal to @xmath54 .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 and the first poincar recurrence is intermediate between the extreme cases ( @xmath57 ) considered above .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 and the first poincar recurrence is intermediate between the extreme cases ( @xmath57 ) considered above .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath55 .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath55 .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath55 .    in the case of an atom positioned at the boundary of @xmath55 the second poincar recurrence associated with the second reflection from the boundaries starts simultaneously in all cases shown in fig xmath61 of the total hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) : a poincar recurrence , i.e. , a partial restoration of the initial state , can appear at time @xmath62 such that the relation @xmath63 is valid for many values of @xmath35 ( for more details see @xcite ) .    in fig . subur[ fig1 ] we present a stroboscopic set of plots describing the space - time propagation of the energy density of the cavity field for the same physical situation ( initial state ) as considered in fig . subur[ fig1 ] when the atom is in the center of the cavity . suburwe see two distinct wave packets propagating to the right and to the left . suburreflection of the wave packets from the cavity mirrors ( at time @xmath64 ) is nicely demonstrated and the subsequent re - excitation of the atom is synchronized with the interference of the wave packets in the center of the cavity ( compare with fig . subur[ fig1 ] ) . suburin the previous section we have considered situations when the atom is `` far '' from the cavity mirrors [ i.e. @xmath41 ] and the wave packets reflected by the mirrors do not directly affect ) . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . [ fig2 ] we present numerical simulations for the time evolution of the population of the upper level of the atom described by the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . [ fig2 ] we present numerical simulations for the time evolution of the atom at the cavity center ( i.e. , @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) . for other atomic positions @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( here @xmath73 ) we clearly see that the closer the atom is to the mirror the slower the spontaneous decay is , that is the inhibition of spontaneous radiation is transparent for the considered positions of the atom . on the other hand for very specific atomic positions close to the mirror the opposite effect - the _ enhancement _ of spontaneous emission - takes place . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . in fig . [ fig2 ] we present numerical simulations for the time evolution of the upper level of the atom from the atom [ @xmath79 for even @xmath14 and @xmath80 for odd @xmath14 ] . embodimentsthe increased density of modes implies an enhancement of the spontaneous emission . in a similar way , when @xmath68 the spatial iphase function @xmath68 is replaced by the spatial iphase function @xmath82 for all @xmath14 around the atomic transition frequency . embodimentshowever , the decrease of the squared interaction constants is compensated for by an increase in the density of interacting modes ( compared with the atom at the cavity center ) and thus the spontaneous emission rate retains the value @xmath3 . for the other extreme case @xmath83 all modes around @xmath78 are significantly decoupled from the atom [ now @xmath84 which results in the dramatic inhibition of the spontaneous emission as seen in fig .  [ fig2 ] . for other positions shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . embodiments[ fig2 ] ( @xmath85 ) the slowing of the spontaneous emission rate is given by the factor @xmath86 . embodimentswe note that in the case @xmath71 the atom decays completely while for @xmath87 the exponential decay law is interrupted by the atom to the neighboring mirror and back is in the case @xmath89 equal approximately to @xmath92 ( here the additional contribution of @xmath49 is due to the reflection from the mirror ) , i.e. there is a destructive interference between the wave packet and the atom which results in the suppression of the radiation . on the other hand ,when @xmath90 the accumulated phase is approximately @xmath93 , which leads to constructive interference . on the other hand ,it means that the reflected wave packet , when it arrives at the position of the atom , starts to stimulate the atomic emission . in the units used in this simulation ,the arrival time of the reflected wave packet is at approximately @xmath94 which coincides with the change of the initial exponential decay of the atom . when the atom is at the position @xmath93 , the accumulated phase of the reflected wave packet is @xmath95 which gives rise to a partial suppression of radiation . in the units used in this simulation ,the arrival time of the reflected wave packet is at approximately @xmath94 which coincides with the change of the initial exponential decay of the atom . when the atom is at the position @xmath91 , the accumulated phase of the reflected wave packet is @x @xcite represents a quite new experimental system . suburthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . suburthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . suburthe modification of the spontaneous emission of the atom embedded in a linear `` crystal '' of two  level atoms is shown in fig . suburthe regular crystal built of @xmath96 atoms fills the central part of the cavity . suburinitially the only excited atom is located at the cavity center and decays in the vacuum field . suburthe modification of the spontaneous emission depends dramatically on the interatomic distance @xmath97 . in the case of the `` lattice '' constant being @xmath98 ( long dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous emission while for @xmath99 ( short dashed line ) an enhancement of radiation compared with the single atom system ( dotted line ) takes place . suburthe origin of this behavior is related to either destructive or constructive interference effects , respectively . from other examples , for @xmath100 ( solid line ) and @xmath101 ( dot  dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous . suburto simulate the situation when the atoms are not regularly distributed in the cavity we next consider random configurations of the atoms . suburspecifically , the atoms are placed randomly such that within each lattice constant there is just one atom . suburdepending on the particular positions of the atoms , the dynamics of the originally excited atom can change dramatically . suburthe atomic radiation can be either enhanced or suppressed . to obtain some effective `` macroscopic '' picture from our simulations , we have averaged over many ( 100 ) random configurations of atoms . suburwe present the results in fig . suburthe dashed ( dotted ) line in this figure shows the time evolution of the atomic population of the initially excited atom when the atoms are regularly positioned with the lattice constant @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , representing enhancement ( suppression ) of radiation with respect to the `` free - space '' decay ( solid line ) . suburthe results of numerical simulations corresponding to averaging over many ( 100 ) random configurations of atoms are presented for the average distance between atoms @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) . in both cases the radiation of the atom is suppressed compared with the `` free - space '' decay . suburanother common feature of the @xmath107 . here we note thatthe destructive interference effect which leads to the strong inhibition of the radiation for the regular crystal is deteriorated for random atomic configurations shown in fig.[fig5 ] . extingwe note that the modification of the spontaneous emission is a local effect , i.e. , the atomic decay is influenced only by neighboring atoms . to check this we have performed simulations with only 10 neighboring atoms ( @xmath108 ) . extingwe have found that the `` exponential '' stage of the spontaneous emission is unchanged comparing with the case @xmath96 , and differences occur only on a much longer time scale . extingit is instructive to note that part of the initial excitation energy is captured in the atomic system . extingin particular , the sum of atomic excitations @xmath109 depends mainly on the number of atoms @xmath18 . extingthis tendency is confirmed in fig . exting[ fig6 ] which shows the cases @xmath110 for @xmath99 . in general, the oscillation patterns reflect complex interference effects . extingnevertheless one can trace a very general tendency in the picture - the `` crystal '' atoms which surround the initially excited atom play the rle of semi - transparent mirrors placed very close to the atom . extingthere is affected by the position of the atom . in particular , it should be stressed that the atom is located in the cavity center and only odd modes can become excited .in particular , if the atom is located in the cavity center even modes are completely decoupled from the atom and only odd modes can become excited [ see eq.([lambda ] ) ] establishing in this way oscillations in the spectrum of modes .attributehowever , at the point when the total excitation energy of the atom is transferred to the field , the _ envelope _ of the spectrum is `` lorentzian '' irrespective of the position of the atom ( providing that the decay is exponential ) .    on the other hand, it should be stressed that the spectrum of the interacting modes is highly transient even during the exponential decay period .attribute[ fig7 ] which shows the spectral envelopes at different time moments during the exponential decay period .attribute[ fig7 ] which shows the spectral envelopes at different time moments during the exponential decay period .attribute[ fig7 ]it undergoes a gradual narrowing from a broad flat spectrum ( initially all modes are in the vacuum state with the same probability ) towards a lorentzian - like line of width @xmath3 .attribute[ fig the `` spectrum '' of overlaps ( shown as @xmath114 ) resembles the emission spectrum of the completely deexcited atom . in other words ,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words ,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words ,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words ,if there exists a quasi - stationary spectrum of the cavity modes , it should mimic the `` spectrum '' of overlaps . in addition , a shift of the atomic transition frequency in the spectrum of eigenvalues can be associated with the energy shift . in our calculations ,we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected . in our calculations , we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected . in other words , we use a broadband approximation , in which the energy shift equals zero . in our calculations ,we next turn our attention to the fact that an additional system of two  level atoms with different transition frequencies @xmath19 the analyzer atoms are equal . in general ,the analyzer atoms give the local and time dependent frequency spectrum which is not necessarily the same as excitations of cavity modes ( [ spec1 ] ) which give the `` instantaneous '' spectrum in the whole cavity . in the case of the atomic decay modes ( [ spec1 ] )the two spectra agree if the times they are read out from the analyzer atoms and the modes are chosen appropriately . in the case of the atomic decay modes ( [ spec1 ] )the two spectra agree if the times they are read out from the analyzer atoms and the modes are chosen appropriately . in the case of the atomic decay modesthe normalized absorption spectrum read out from the analyzer atoms is show in fig . exting[ fig7b ] . extinghere we have considered that the decay rates ( i.e. linewidths ) @xmath116 of the analyzer atoms are mutually equal and @xmath117 . extinga bunch of one hundred of analyzer atoms is positioned @xmath118 apart of the decaying atom in the cavity center . extingthe atomic frequencies @xmath19 are equally spaced around the transition frequency @xmath78 of the central atom . extingwe see very good agreement with the _ the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) with the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) within the broadband approximation leads in second - order perturbation theory to _ logarithmically _ divergent energy shifts for @xmath126 @xcite . practition( note that in our numerical calculations we have eliminated the shift of the excited atomic level by choosing a symmetrical frequency cutoff @xmath115 . ) without the broadband approximation , when the frequency dependence of the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) is taken into account , the energy shifts diverge _ linearly_. it is well known @xcite that if instead of the dipole approximation @xmath24 we start with @xmath127 then after the rwa is applied one obtains the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) but with a different frequency dependence of the interaction constant , i.e. g_n^(j ) = ( ) ^1/2 d_eg^(j)(k_n r_j ) .[lambda2 ] in the broadband approximation the interaction constants given by eq.([lambda ] ) and eq.([lambda2 ] ) are identical and the results do not depend on the choice of the interaction hamiltonian .

[ 4.2 ] which is possible due to the fact that in the _ finite - dimensional _ hilbert spaces matrix elements of density operators are analytic functions . consequently , @xmath140 are non - singular operators ( except perhaps for a set of _ isolated _ values of @xmath143 ) in which case the liouvillian superoperator can be expressed as ( t , t_0):= ^-1(t , t_0)(t ) . [ 4.3 ] we note that @xmath140 is uniquely specified by @xmath145 and by the initial state @xmath146 of the environment .    in an earlier paper @xcite:we have propose a general algorithm how to reconstruct the liouvillian superoperator @xmath147 from the knowledge of the unitary evolution of the composite @xmath134 system [ .    to apply the formalism presented in refescription@xcite we remind ourselves that the initial state of the atom - field system considered in the present paper reads |(t_0)= |e_1|g_|0 _ , [ 4.4 ] where @xmath148 describes the excited state of the initially excited atom , while @xmath149 describes the rest of the @xmath18 atoms which are initially in the ground state . in the formalism presented in refescription@xcite we remind ourselves that the initial state of the atom - field system considered in the present paper reads |(t_0)= |e_1|g_|0 _ , [ 4.4 ] where @xmath150 describes the state vector @xmath150 denotes the vacuum of the cavity field . in the formalism presented in refescription@xcitebecause the model hamiltonian @xmath151 ( [ htot ] ) is chosen so that the number of excitations in the system is an integral of motion we can express the state vector of the atom field system at time @xmath143 as |(t)&= & c_1(t)|e_1|g_|0 _ + & )= re ; ( t)= i m . exting[ 4.7 ] where ( t)= re ; ( t)= i m . exting[ 4.7 ] where ( t)= -2 ; [ 4.8 ] in general the parameter @xmath159 can not be derived in an analytical form . in fig . exting[ 4.8 ] we present results of numerical evaluation . extingwe assume the initially excited atom to be in the center of the cavity . in the chosen units we obtain from the fermi golden rule. exting[ see eq.([decay1 ] ) the decay rate @xmath160 ( see dashed line ) . extingwe consider two cases : firstly when there is just a single excited atom in the cavity ( dotted line ) and secondly , when the excited atom is surrounded by @xmath161 atoms ( solid line ) which create a `` linear '' crystal with regular spacing between atoms ( @xmath100 ) . in the case of the single atom @xmath156 oscillates around the value @xmath3 . extingthe amplitudes of these oscillations are relatively small till the recurrence time when it eventually takes negative values ( i.e. the atom starts to absorb energy from the field - compare with fig . have shown how the decay of the atom is modified due to the mode structure of the cavity field and the presence of neighboring atoms .    in the cavity qed model considered here,we have neglected all mechanical effects of the em field on atoms . to account for effects of quantized center  of  mass motion one can _ generalize _ the model to a system of _ trapped atoms _ interacting with em field in the cavity .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we can assume a situation when due to laser cooling the atoms embedded in a cavity ( or pbs ) are effectively trapped by harmonic ( optical ) potential .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there is a close analogy with the model of trapped ions @xcite .    in our next paper , we will discuss the quantum version of the extinction theorem @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we focus on the propagation of one - photon wave packets in a cavity .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\these wave packets are represented as superpositions of many cavity modes .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\for example , we will study in detail scattering of a photon wave packet on a single two - level atom .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we will show that the atom within this framework effectively behaves as _ quantum _ beam splitter or semi - transparent mirror .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we will also discuss dynamics of the wave packet incident on a `` crystal '' composed of european union network on microlasers and cavity quantum electrodynamics , the uk engineering and physical sciences research council and the royal society .s. haroche and d. kleppner , _ phys . today _ practition* 42(1 ) * , 24 ( 1989 ) ;

theoretic point of view , a dense parity check matrix is desirable for realizing a good linear error correction scheme . weapthe main contribution of this work is the direct theorems , which give the conditions for achieving arbitrarily small estimation error probabilities . in the same way that the shannon limit has been used as a benchmark for the combination of a code and a decoding algorithm , in this paper , these results can provide a concrete benchmark for existing and emerging reconstruction algorithms , such as belief propagation @xcite @xcite , and can stimulate the development of novel reconstruction algorithms . in this paper, we assumed a bernoulli source and noise , but , since the aep holds for them , the arguments presented here may be applicable to stationary ergodic sources and noises . weapthe author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers of international symposium on information",

in tidally - locked gas giant planet could cause a highly non - uniform temperature distribution with horizontal temperature variations of up to 1000  k. while such atmospheric circulation models are not yet sophisticated enough to generate temperature - pressure profiles and emergent spectra they do indicate a major uncertainty of all current cegp atmospheric structure models that needs to be growth and grain destruction , including condensation , coalescence , sublimation , and sedimentation . nominetwo recently developed cloud models ( ackerman & marley 2001 ; cooper et al . warr2003 ) aim to predict particle sizes and are meant to be used consistently in a model atmosphere that determines the temperature , pressure , and radiation field ( e.g. , marley et al . warr2002 ) . nevertheless even these cloud models are used in homogeneous layers , not patchy clouds that may exist , and the models still have other uncertainties . nominewe use the results of such computations as a basic guide for our choice of cloud particle size . nomineother uncertainties are about upper atmosphere processes such as photoionization and photochemistry which could cause small absorptive particles . nominewe must make choices within the large model atmosphere input parameter space ; here we have chosen to work with two fiducial models . nomineboth models have solar abundance . nominethe first model is our cloudy model where we choose a vertically and horizontally homogeneous cloud of mgsio@xmath8 cloud particles that is two pressure -

pixel sensitivity variations of a few @xmath65 do not manifest themselves in the pupil image motion . practition* 4 . detector and electronics . practition* these effects include : ( a ) ccd readout noise ; ( b ) dark noise and possible drifts in dark current ; ( c ) pixel - to - pixel and sub - pixel sensitivity gradients ( see ( 3 ) above ) ; ( d ) analogue - to - digital conversion ( adc ) non - linearities ; ( e ) slight variations in readout - channel gain ; and ( f ) uncertainties in the integration times .    in our simulations , by far , the dominant sources of noise are poisson statistics ( photon noise ) and stellar granulation . practitionthe photon noise in the @xmath0 botis simulations shown in  5 is at a level of 0.74 ppm ( 1@xmath37 ) . if granulation noise is included in the simulations , the 1-@xmath37 noise rises to 1.40 ppm . practitionthe other noise sources turn out to be negligible for the timescales associated with cegp scattered light curves . practitionthe dominant sources of gone unnoticed in previous simulations ( seager et al . exting2000 ) because of the low angular resolution used to calculate the fluxes scattered from the planet in those models . extingour work has shown it is essential to use angular bins of less than a degree to properly compute the light curves , especially for the very close - in extrasolar planets . with the proper source geometry , the light curves are smoothed for separations smaller than 0.07 au and the amplitude of the light curve is reduced by up to 20% for orbital inclinations near @xmath67 ( as noted in seager et al . exting2000 ) . extingthe addition of stellar back heating was found to be negligible even for space - based photometry of precision 1 ppm . extingtypically , stellar back heating contributed a flux ratio of @xmath68 or less . extingthe effect of tidal distortion was slightly larger than back heating . extingthe tidal distortion alone can change the scattered flux of a planet at 0.045 au from 0.9956 at minimum projected area to 1.0022 at maximum area , where 1.0 is the undistorted value . extingthis translates to an additional variation of @xmath69 about the mean in the light curve . extingtypically , stellar back heating contributed dependent on the inclination . in the case of an eccentric orbit ,as shown in figure 3a , the peak value can drop by up to an order of magnitude when the inclination is changed from 90 to 50 degrees . in the case of an eccentric orbit ,the peak value can drop by up to an order of magnitude when the inclination is changed from 90 to 50 degrees . in the case of an eccentric orbit ,as shown in figure 3b , the peak value can drop by up to an order of magnitude when the inclination is changed from 90 to 50 degrees . in the case of an eccentric orbit ,the shape of the light curve is altered in a unique way for each parameter ( given a specific atmospheric model ) . from figure 2 ,the inclination clearly distorts the light curve shape while the radius simply scales the amplitude . in the case of an eccentric orbit ,the amplitude at all points varies proportionally to the radius squared ( figure 3c ) . by comparing the effects of inclination and radius ( figure 3b and 3c ) ,the shape of the curve is altered in a unique way for each parameter ( given a specific atmospheric model ) . from figure 2 ,the inclination clearly distorts the light curve shape while the radius simply scales the amplitude . in the case of an such temperature variations will also affect the photon wavelength distribution and the level of tidal distortion . embodimentshowever , only close - in extrasolar planet systems with nearly circular orbits have been selected as most primary targets so the current assumptions of zero eccentricity are valid . embodimentsthe outputs of the extrasolar planet light curve model described in  2 and  3 were used as the inputs to the most photometric simulation program described in  5.2 . embodimentsthe light curve model gives the intrinsic variability of the ( star + planet ) system as seen from above the earth s atmosphere , while the photometric simulation adds realistic noise and variability inherent to the most instrument . embodimentsthree different inclinations of the planet orbit have been considered : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ( more accurately , the maximum inclination that does not produce transits , since transits have not been observed in @xmath0 botis or 51 peg ) .    for this paper , embodimentswe present synthetic data for one of the prime extrasolar planet targets for the most mission : @xmath0 botis b. the star @xmath0 botis can be observed by most for about 50 days without interruption ( except for brief passages through the saa ; see stray light and temperature due to orbital modulation . in these simulations , we have adopted a granulation noise amplitude and spectrum comparable to the sun ( see  3 ) . embodimentsthe simulated photometry for @xmath0 botis observed at an orbital inclination of @xmath72 is presented in figure 5 , showing the unbinned data ( filled symbols ) and the same data binned into groups of 100 min each ( open symbols ) . embodimentsthe modulation of the flux due to the extrasolar planet orbit orbital period is just barely discernible by eye in the data presented in this form . embodimentsthe periodic modulation becomes more obvious in figure 6 , where those data have been binned in phase according to the known orbital period of @xmath0 botis b. also shown in this figure are the original input models for the three different inclinations modeled . embodimentsthe binned data clearly follow the input model appropriate for this data set .       the detection and characterization of the planet scattered light variation is even more obvious in fourier space . in figure 5 , we showthe periodic modulation becomes more obvious in figure 6 , where those data have been binned in phase according to the known orbital period of @xmath0 botis b. also shown in the fourier spectrum of the photometry is a valuable way to objectively describe the detailed shape of the light curve .the spectrum of the simulated most data is plotted as the bold curve , while the three representative input simulations of the planet light curves are lighter lines . the most `` data '' and the @xmath74-inclination model to which it corresponds lie on top of one another .note also that the harmonic structure of the light curves is very sensitive to the inclination . andthe amplitude ratio of the first harmonic to fundamental drops noticeably with decreasing inclination compared to higher harmonics .    to investigate this further, we generated a more complete grid of models sampling orbital inclination @xmath75 , for two planet radii ( 1.1 and 1.5 jupiter radii ) , and plotted the fundamental and harmonic peak amplitudes as a function of orbital inclination @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : harmonic ] ) .    to investigate this further, we generated a more complete grid of models sampling orbital inclination @xmath75 , for two planet radii ( 1.1 and 1.5 jupiter radii ) , and plotted the fundamental and harmonic peak amplitudes as a function of orbital inclination @xmath75 ( figure  [ the harmonic amplitudes have different dependences on inclination and radius , which will be valuable in finding the correct match between model and data .attributethe `` forward '' approach of adjusting the model to fit the observations is not efficient and may lead to close but incorrect matches . by comparing the harmonic content of the data to those of models from a grid of extrasolar planet parameters , we can eliminate obvious mismatches and narrow the search to the most promising candidate models more quickly and reliably .attributethis approach is already widely used in the pulsating star community , where fourier decomposition of @xmath78 scuti light curves has become a valuable tool in identifying non -

edge - on inclinations , and in progressing towards a workable model of the atmosphere .   we are currently working on simulations of hd 209458b .    in modeling cegp light curves we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   in addition, we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   in addition, we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   one significant point is that the angular size of the star is important for planets with semi - major axes @xmath79 0.1 au .   this affects the high - angular - resolution features of the light curve compared to using a point - source star ( see figure  [ fig : lc1 ] ) .   in addition , modeling the light curve with a star of finite angular size instead of a point source causes a reduction in amplitude of a highly backscattering - peaked light curve by approximately 20 percent ( as first noted in seager et al . ).   the other & burrows , a. 2001 , apj , 552 , 699 buzasi , d. l , 2000 the third mons workshop : science preparation and target selection , aarhus universitet , 2000 , eds . t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & t.r . , & mayor , m. 2000 , apj , 529 , l45 charbonneau , d. , noyes , r. w. , korzennik , s. g. , nisenson , p. jha , s. , vogt , s. s. , & kibrick , r. i. 1999 , apj , 522 , l145 cho , j. y -

dependence of mass function , one is hyperbolic and the other is algebraic . embodimentsthe corresponding potentials have very different aspects based on the values of the si parameter @xmath123 . both are non - singular for @xmath141 , where the constant @xmath58 appears in the process of relating schrdinger hamiltonian with super hamiltonian . the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath177 characterizes position - dependence of mass ( [ ex1 ] ) and ( [ ex2 ] ) respectively . embodimentsthe non - singular algebraic potential ( [ si1 ] ) shares same qualitative features as those discovered in ref . embodimentsthe corresponding potential that the novelty of our work lies in the fact that we have generalized for the first time the concept of si to the second order susy approach for em hamiltonians . in this context,one should look into the explicit classification done in ref . and in this context,one should look into the explicit classification done in ref . practition@xcite via @xmath1-fold susy approach to em quantum systems . embodimentsthe systems investigated in this article belong to a special subclass of the systems studied there , which possess second order shape -

      "generated": "formation of galaxies and their influence on the physical state of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) is often studied using semi - analytical models of structure formation ( for example @xcite ) . embodimentssuch studies will allow one to extensively explore the unknown parameter space related to physical conditions in a high redshift galaxy and its star formation , with limited computational resources . embodimentssemi - analytical models together with available observations can be used to understand the evolution of our universe while putting tight constraints on various physical processes associated with the high redshift universe . in samui et al . ( 2007 , 2008 ) ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we used semi - analytical models to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions of lbgs and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift . embodimentsthe first halo mass function in an analytical form was given by press & schechter ( 1974 ) . embodimentsthe press - schechter ( ps ) mass function has been widely employed in 3 to @xmath4 , to model both the effect of outflows and the galactic luminosity function . Additionally,one also needs to have a large enough number of halos in the simulation or a large number of realizations of the merger trees , to obtain good statistics of the range of galaxy properties . Consequently,therefore , to have a preliminary look at this challenging problem , in paper  i and  ii , we focused on analytical methods . In particular we used the ps mass function and the sasaki formalism , to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in paper  i and  ii , we concluded that the observed redshift evolution of the luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath5 requires evolution in physical properties that govern the star formation activity on top of the evolution in the number density of dark matter halos coming from the structure formation model .    in paper  i and  ii ,we found that the required amount of redshift evolution in the star formation activities depends on the redshift evolution of the number density of dark matter halos and hence on these conclusions may crucially depend on the choice of the adopted form of the mass function . extingit is known that the ps mass function does not provide a good fit to the number density of dark matter halos determined from recent high resolution simulations of galaxy formation . from such simulations a number of different fitting formulae for the halo mass function have been suggested ( see for example sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et al . 2001 ; reed et al . 2003 , 2007 and warren et al . 2005 ) . extingit is known that there is no direct way to scale the results obtained by assuming the ps mass function to results which would arise from these other mass functions . extingtherefore it is important to revisit various issues discussed in paper  i and ii considering the mass functions determined from the simulations . extingthis forms the basic motivation of this paper . extingwe will mainly concentrate , as in paper  i and ii , on high redshift ( i.e. @xmath11 ) uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and the effect of galactic outflows on the igm adopting a self consistent reionization history . extingtherefore it is important to revisit various issues discussed in paper  i and the halo mass function is defined to be positive definite . nominethis is the disadvantage of using the derivative of the mass function . nominenevertheless , in the range of halo masses that we will be interested in at different redshifts , we will see that the derivative of the mass function is indeed positive definite . nominetherefore , for other mass functions consider in this work , we simply use its derivative to model the net formation rate of dark matter halos . nominewe will also compare results obtained using the derivative as an alternative to the sasaki formalism for the ps mass function . nominethe paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we review different proposals for the halo mass function that we wish to study and also compare the net formation rate of collapsed halos predicted by these mass functions . nominethe star formation and reionization models are described in section  3 . in section  4 , we review different proposals for the halo mass function that we wish to study and also compare the net formation rate of collapsed halos predicted by these mass functions . nominethe star formation and reionization models are described in section  3 . in section  4 ,we show the effect of the halo mass function on the predicted uv luminosity given redshift @xmath22 . suburthe differential halo mass function is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average density of the universe at that redshift . suburthe rms density fluctuations , @xmath25 , of the smooth density field with a top - hat window function is defined as @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the real - space top - hat filter , and @xmath30 is the growth factor of linear perturbations normalized to unity at @xmath28 ( peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 2002 ) . suburthe idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq . suburthe argument[ eqn_mf ] is that different analytical forms of the halo mass function can be represented with different forms of the function @xmath31 in that equation . suburfor example , @xmath31 for the ps mass function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical over density for collapse , usually taken to be equal to @xmath34 . suburthe idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq . @xmath35 { \\frac}{\\delta_c}{\\sigma}\\exp{\\left(-{\\frac}{a\\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}. \\label{eqn_st}\\ ] ] choosing @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in eq . subur[ eqn_st ] provides a better fit to mass functions obtained from numerical simulations over a wide range of masses and redshifts compared to the ps formula . suburnote that , if we take @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq . subur[ eqn_st ] then the st mass function reduces to the ps mass function . subur( 2001 ) found deviation from the st mass function in their simulations of the @xmath42cdm and @xmath43cdm cosmologies . suburthey proposed another @xmath31 which fits better their own simulations over more than four orders of magnitude in mass , @xmath44 to @xmath45 . subur[ eqn_st ] then the st mass function reduces to the ps mass function . subur( 2001 ) found deviation from the st mass function in their simulations of the @xmath42 method for compensating the effects of finite simulation volume . suburthis allowed them to find an approximation to the true ` global ' mass function . suburthey proposed another fitting formula given by @xmath50{\\frac}{\\delta_c}{\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp{\\left[-{\\frac}{c a \\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2 } -

analytical models are to the assumed form of the halo mass function . in paper  i , we consider these set of @xmath31 to examine how sensitive the predictions of semi - analytical models are to the assumed form of the halo mass function . in paper  i ,we begin by comparing the net formation rate of dark matter halos for different halo mass functions described above . in paper  i ,this is the most fundamental ingredient in any semi - analytical model of galaxy formation . in paper i  &  ii we used sasaki formalism of the ps mass function to get the formation rate . following the same steps for the st mass function we obtain @xmath58 \\left[{\\frac}{d(z_c)}{ section 1 , we rather model the net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos , by taking the redshift derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath65 .        in fig . [ fig_rates ] we show the ratio of the redshift derivatives for different halo mass functions to that obtained for the ps mass function . in panels with @xmath66 we show three characteristics masses related to our star formation model at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]in addition with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows we show the masses corresponding to halos with circular velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . this is the mass range where radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background becomes important ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see in sec .  3 ) . [ fig_rates ]in this redshift range the process of reionization is believed to be already over ( fan et al . (2006 ) mass functions predict similar halo formation rate ( within 10% ) around the characteristic mass which corresponds to @xmath73 fluctuations . embodimentshowever , at the typical halo masses that will be detected as galaxies ( @xmath74 ) ps underpredicts the net halo formation rate upto an order of magnitude .    for @xmath75 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath76 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath75 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath76 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath76 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath75 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath76 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .    for @xmath75 , the predictions of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude obtained from the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function , ( @xmath82 ) , to that calculated by taking the derivative ( @xmath83 ) . This is because in the sasaki formalism one needs two redshifts , namely the collapse redshift ( @xmath60 ) of the halo and the observed redshift ( @xmath22 ) in order to calculate the formation rate weighted by the survival probability . on the other hand, one needs two redshifts , namely the collapse redshift ( @xmath60 ) of the halo and the observed redshift ( @xmath22 ) in order to calculate the formation rate weighted by the survival probability . on the other hand, one needs two redshifts ,the derivative contains only one redshift , the collapse redshift . This is because in the sasaki formalism one needs two redshifts , the collapse redshift and the observed redshift .however , we will try to show the difference between these two approaches in the specific context of outflows in section 5 .    in the following sections we will show how the predictions of semi - analytic galaxy formation models change with the mass function used .We begin with a brief overview of our prescriptions for star formation assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed [ see eq .  ( 6)-(8 ) of paper  i ] . embodimentsonly a fraction ( @xmath92 ) of this uv luminosity would come out from the galaxy due to the absorption by dust . embodimentsthe minimum critical mass of a halo ( @xmath93 ) which can sustain star formation at a given epoch is decided by the cooling efficiency of the gas and also by radiative feedback in ionized regions . embodimentswe consider models with @xmath93 corresponding to a virial temperature , @xmath94  k ( as `` atomic cooled model '' ) and @xmath95  k ( as `` molecular cooled model '' ) . for ionized regions of the universe , our models assume complete suppression of star formation in halos below a circular velocity @xmath96  km  s@xmath97 , no suppression above circular velocity of @xmath98 km s@xmath97 and a linear fit from @xmath99 to @xmath100 for the intermediate masses ( as in benson et al . 2002 ; also see benson et al . 2002 ; dijkstra et al . 2005 ; dijkstra et i ) . the reionization history of the universe is required to self - consistently incorporate radiative feedback for each model . in table  [ tab_reion ]we compute it following again the method set out in paper  i ( section 2.4 ) . in table [ tab_reion ] we summarize the reionization history in terms of the electron scattering optical depth to the reionization ( @xmath102 ) and the redshift of reionization ( @xmath103 ) for some of our models .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note thatin all these calculations we have assumed only 10% of the created uv photons escape into the igm .note that in all these calculations we have assumed only 10% of the created uv photons escape into the igm .note that we have assumed only 10% of the created uv photons escape into the igm .note that ion ]    table  [ tab_reion ] shows that there is negligible difference in @xmath102 and @xmath103 if one uses the derivative of the ps mass function or the sasaki formalism to calculate the net formation rate of collapsed halos . for a range of @xmath106 , the st and other mass functions predict slightly different reionization histories compared to the ps mass function or the sasaki formalism to calculate the net formation rate of collapsed halos . for a range of @xmath106 , the st and other mass functions predict slightly different reionization histories compared to the ps mass function though they do not differ greatly amongst themselves .attributeit is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model .attributeit is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model .attributeit is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model . given redshift compared to atomic cooled models , and causes early suppression of star formation in halos with a circular velocity less than @xmath98 km s@xmath97 . suburhence it takes longer time to get complete reionization of the igm making @xmath103 less in molecular cooled models .    hence we conclude that the st and other mass functions leads to higher @xmath102 compared to the ps mass function even when we use lower @xmath85 . suburthus to reproduce observed @xmath102 , the models using other mass functions require less efficiency for star formation and/or uv escape compared to that of models using the ps mass function . suburif stars are formed with ` top - heavy ' imf in the molecular cooled low mass halos then one has to further reduce the @xmath85 in those halos , to have a consistent @xmath102 . suburin particular the reionization efficiency of molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the st and other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the ps mass function . suburin this section we turn our attention to the uv luminosity function . suburfirst we illustrate the differences between results from different mass functions for fixed model parameters the observed luminosity range . extingthis is simply a manifestation of the fact that the ps mass function predicts less number of rare high mass halos compared to other mass functions . extingbut at the low mass end the ps mass function predicts a higher number density of collapsed objects . extingthis effect can be seen at @xmath113 where the uv luminosity function at @xmath114 is slightly higher for the models with ps mass function . extingthe difference between the ps mass function and other mass functions are mass dependent which leads to a different slope in the luminosity function calculated from different mass functions . extingas expected all the other halo mass functions obtained from the simulation predict almost the same luminosity function at all redshifts . extingit is interesting to see that all the mass functions predict almost similar luminosity function at @xmath113 even though they are different at higher redshifts . as we pointed out before the slopes of the luminosity functions coming from different mass functions are indeed different .    in the right panels of fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] we show the ratio of luminosity function obtained from the ps mass function to that from the st mass function . extingit is clear from the figure that there is a characteristics lumin . at @xmath115 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath118 and similar number of halos at the mass corresponding to @xmath119 km  s@xmath97 . extingthus we see a much better matching at the low luminosity end of the luminosity function ( see fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] ) and a very strong deviation at the high luminosity end for @xmath120 . extingthus the reasonable match in the luminosity function at @xmath113 and strong disagreement at high-@xmath22 could be attributed to the fact that as one moves to higher and higher for any @xmath86 we detect galaxies whose ages are @xmath124 , when they shine the maximum . in the sasaki formalism , only a fraction of halos @xmath125 formed at @xmath126 survive at the observed time @xmath127 . for small @xmath86 , we have @xmath128 , and thus @xmath129 and the luminosity function predicted by the sasaki formalism is higher , as its formation rate is higher . in the sasaki formalism , the luminosity function predicted by the sasaki formalism is higher , as its formation rate is higher . in the sasaki formalism , the luminosity function predicted by the sasaki formalism is higher , as its formation rate is higher . in the sasaki formalism ,however as @xmath86 increases , @xmath130 increases , @xmath131 decreases , and hence luminosity functions computed by the two methods first approach each other for @xmath132 , after which the derivative method starts to produce a larger luminosity function . nevertheless , since @xmath90 is much smaller than the hubble time , we find the differences between the luminosity function calculated by these two methods , are less than @xmath122 for mass functions reproduce the observed luminosity functions . for each redshift bin the observed luminosity function is given as follows:we have used the most recent measurement of the luminosity function that covers a wide range in luminosity . we have used the most recent measurement of the luminosity function given by reddy & steidel ( 2008 ) which covers the low luminosity end well .it is known that the estimations of luminosity function of lbgs suffer from the lack of redshift information and cosmic variance much more than typical poisson errors ( for example see beckwith et al .2006 ; reddy et al . 2008 ; bouwens et al . 2007 ; 2009 ) . suburas @xmath0 minimization technique is sensitive to the errors , in our analysis we use errors that take care of the cosmic variance in addition to the poisson error . suburwe consider @xmath134 as the only free parameter . as this lf parameteris assumed to be constant over the whole mass range , varying @xmath134 is like changing the mass to light ratio . suburnote that the observed luminosity functions are also given at different rest wavelength . suburfor example at @xmath135  3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7.4 the observed data seen from the table  [ tab_fit ] the model using the st mass function provides a good fit to the data ( with a reduced @xmath138 ) . whereas the reduced @xmath0 for the model using the ps mass function is high ( @xmath139 ) . This is mainly because the ps mass function overpredicts low luminosity objects and under predicts high luminosity objects .this is mainly because the ps mass function overpredicts low luminosity objects and under predicts high luminosity objects .this together with the incompleteness in the observational data used in paper  i prompted us to say in paper  i that one needs additional feedback to suppress the star formation in low mass halos that contribute to lf at the low luminosity end .this is mainly because of the incompleteness in the observational data used in paper  i prompted us to say in paper  i that one needs additional feedback to suppress the star formation in low mass halos that contribute to lf at the low luminosity end .this is mainly because the ps mass function is high ( @xmath139 ) .however , it is clear now that for models with st mass function , no additional feedback is needed to fit the luminosity function at @xmath xmath166 & @xmath167 & @xmath168 + @xmath169 & @xmath168 + @xmath169 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & @xmath172 & @xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 +   +   +   +   +   +   +   [ tab_fit ]    we now consider the luminosity functions for @xmath176 . suburthe observed luminosity function at this redshift covers a much wider luminosity range , thanks to the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) and goods ( the great observatories origins deep survey ) data . suburtabulated luminosity functions based on hudf and goods are available in beckwith et al . subur( 2006 ) and bouwens et al . suburwe use bouwens et al s data for our analysis . suburthey estimate rms due to cosmic variance to be @xmath177% . suburthis fractional uncertainty is added to the poisson error in quadrature ( as done in beckwith et al . subur2006 and bouwens et al . suburwe find that this is essential to get @xmath178 while @xmath137 and @xmath179 but decreases for models using st mass function . suburthe observed luminosity functions for @xmath180 using hudf are available in oesch et al . subur( 2007 ) and bouwens et al . suburwe use bouwens et al s data for our analysis . a fractional uncertainty of @xmath181 ( bowens et al . 2007 ) is added to the poisson error in quadrature . suburwe ignore the last two data points at the low luminosity end due to incompleteness ( bouwens et al . , 2007 ) . suburit is clear from table  [ tab_fit ] and fig . subur[ fig_uv_lf_fit ] that the observed lf at this redshift is not reproduced well either by models using st mass function or ps mass function . observed points in the lower luminosity end are systematically lower than model predictions . suburwe ignore the last two data points at the low luminosity end due to incompleteness ( bouwens et al . , 2007 ) . suburnote such a structure in lf , if true , can not be reproduced by our models . suburhowever , what is interesting is that for this redshift bin due to small volume sampled . as the number of constraints is small , we find that the models with the st and ps mass function reproduce the observed data much better than the models with the ps mass function . Additionally,are less models with both the mass function reproduce the data well . suburthe interesting result that emerges from the analysis presented till now is that the models with the st mass function reproduce the observed lf much better than the ones that use the ps mass function . suburwe also checked whether this result is valid if we use different observed luminosity functions . suburwe find our best fit value of @xmath134 depends very much on the observed luminosity function we use ( similar to what one finds for the schechter function parameters ) . suburfor example , for @xmath186 the observed luminosity functions lack high precision measurements in the high luminosity end due to the small volume probed . suburthus our best fit @xmath134 is decided by how well we fit the low luminosity end of the luminosity functions in the high luminosity end. however , ground based measurements which sample the high luminosity end well , tend to have slightly higher @xmath134 . suburideally one should merge the ground and space based measurements by carefully accounting for the luminosity function has been measured , for the models with the st and ps mass functions respectively . extingnote that in principle , the amount of dust reddening correction depends very much on the wavelength . extinghence , in order to compare the best fit values of @xmath134 at different redshifts we use the dust model like that applicable to the galaxy or large magellanic clouds @xcite , and bring all the @xmath134 values to the wavelength of @xmath91   . extingthese values are also tabulated in table  [ tab_fit ] ( in column  4 and 7 for the models with the st and ps mass functions respectively ) . extingit is clear from the table that no particular trend emerges at @xmath187 though for higher redshifts an increase of @xmath134 may be needed . extingas already mentioned , the best fit values of @xmath134 very much depend on the observed luminosity function we have used . extingalso the nature of dust in the high redshift galaxies is very uncertain . extinghence at this stage it is difficult to predict any trend on the values of @xmath134 and hence on the evolution of star formation in the high redshift galaxies . extingalso the nature molecular cooled models . practitionhowever , the molecular cooled objects play an important role in setting up the metallicity floor in the igm at high redshift as shown in paper  ii . therefore, we will also consider the models with star formation in molecular cooled objects for galactic outflows . practitionwe turn now to models of galactic outflows and their feedback into the igm , an issue that was addressed in detail in paper ii . note that the metals detected in the igm can only have been synthesized by stars in galaxies , and galactic outflows are the primary means by which they can be transported from galaxies into the igm ( silk , wyse & shields , 1987 , tegmark , silk & evrad 1993 , miralda -

shell approximation ( see eqs . 神( 5)-(16 ) of paper  ii for the details ) . embodimentsthe dark matter potential of the halo is assumed to be in nfw profile and a fraction ( @xmath190 ) of the total baryonic mass is taken to be in thermal equilibrium at virial temperature in this potential . the amount of mass coming out of the star forming region is assumed to be proportional to the mass of stars formed with the proportionality constant @xmath191 . embodimentswe also assume that @xmath192 of the shocked igm / halo gas is concentrated in the thin - shell region and rest @xmath193 is incorporated in the hot bubble . embodimentsthe initial radius of the shell is taken to be @xmath194 the virial radius , and the outflow is frozen to the hubble flow when its peculiar velocity drops to the sound speed of the surrounding igm . embodimentsthe extent @xmath195 , to which an individual outflow can propagate into the igm , depends mainly on the rate of sne productions and the of individual outflow models, we can study several global properties of the wind affected regions . embodimentsone simple quantity is the porosity @xmath199 , which is a measure of the ( volume ) fraction of the universe affected by outflows . embodimentsthis is calculated by adding up the outflow volumes around all the sources at any redshift : @xmath200 ^ 3 . embodiments [ [ [ \\label{eqn_q}\\ ] ] here , @xmath201 is the radius of an outflow at redshift @xmath22 , arising from a halo of mass @xmath20 which collapsed at redshift @xmath60 . embodimentsthis comes from solving for the outflow dynamics . embodimentsnote that in the sasaki formalism as applied to the ps mass function , one has to replace @xmath83 by @xmath202 ( see paper  ii ) . embodimentsfor @xmath203 the porosity gives the probability that a randomly selected point in the universe at @xmath22 lies within an outflow region . embodimentsfor @xmath204 , it is more useful to define the associated filling factor of the outflow regions , which if outflows are randomly distributed is given by , @xmath205 $ ] . embodimentsone dashed magenta ) and reed ( dotted dashed violet ) halo mass functions . in all these models we assume @xmath206 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we also show the filling factor as calculated from the the ps mass function using both the sasaki formalism ( thick solid black line ) and by taking the derivative to compute the net formation rate ( the short dashed red line ) . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath208 of order @xmath209 at @xmath113 . for comparison,we assume @xmath207 . for comparison,we assume @xmath208 of order @xmath209 at @xmath113 . for comparison,we assume @ assumes that the outflowing material no longer contributes to the volume filling factor .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\but in the models with the derivative of the ps mass function once an outflow is formed it contributes to the volume filling factor for ever ; although the derivative itself gives the net ( formation minus destruction ) rate , at @xmath60 . and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus leads to a smaller formation rate of halos at @xmath60 . the net difference between sasaki formalism and the derivative of the ps mass function , at @xmath60 , can be seen from fig .  [ eqn_q ] , which can be seen from fig .  [ eqn_q ] , whichcan be seen from fig_sasaki_deriv ] .    in this figure , which can be seen from fig .  [ eqn_q ] , which can be seen from fig .  [ eqn_q ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we show @xmath82 and @xmath215 as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath216 and @xmath214 halos , while fixing @xmath217 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\note that @xmath82 and @xmath215 come as a part of the integrand over @xmath60 while calculating the por xmath113 , the integrand in eq .  [ eqn_q ] will be larger for the ps derivative compared to that obtained from sasaki formalism ( for the range of halo masses and @xmath60 that contributes dominantly to @xmath208 ) . nominefor this reason the model with the derivative of the ps mass function predicts higher volume filling factor even if the uv luminosity function predicted by them were same . nominenote that when we use the sasaki formalism , we could go to the other extreme and not destroy any outflow , by replacing the survival probability , @xmath219 , with unity . in this case, we find that the volume filling factor is the largest , even higher than that obtained when one uses the derivative of the mass function to calculate the halo formation rate . nominewe show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] . nominethe volume filling factor that realistically obtains will be bracketed by these two cases ( the thick / thin solid lines of fig .  [ fig_filling ] ) . nominethis difference also gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the volume filling factor obtained in semi - analytic models . nominewe see from fig  [ fig_rates produced by star formation ( the top set of curves ) , and that injected into the igm ( the lower set of curves ) . due to the reason already mentioned above ,the porosity weighted average peculiar velocity ( in km  s@xmath97 ) and hot bubble temperature of the outflows are shown in panel ( e ) and ( f ) respectively .[ height=566, width=566,height=491 ]    in fig . [ fig_wind_avg ][ fig_wind_avg ] we show various physical parameters related to outflows for the derivative of the ps ( dashed ) and st ( solid ) mass function . for comparison, we conclude from fig .we also show the results for the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function with dotted dashed line . in panel(){( a ) we compare the filling factor that we have already discussed in great details . in panel(){panel ( b ) compares the porosity weighted average mass of the dark matter halos that contribute to the filling factor . since the st mass function predicts more high mass objects , the average halo mass that contribute to the filling factor predicted by this model is slightly higher compared to the ps mass function for @xmath221 . however , panel( e ), panel( f ) , panel( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively . for the ps mass function , the porosity averaged peculiar velocity and the temperature are higher in case of the sasaki formalism and the derivative due to the higher volume filling factor . for the ps mass function , although the sasaki formalism and the derivative have the same @xmath85 the average peculiar velocity and the temperature are lower in the model with the derivative due to the higher volume filling factor . in general, the porosity averaged peculiar velocity and the temperature are lower in the model with the derivative due to the higher volume filling factor . in general, the porosity averaged peculiar velocity and the temperature are lower in the model with the derivative due to the higher volume filling factor . in general, we conclude from fig . 神[ fig_wind_avg ] that even if the filling factor changes depending on the way we calculate the net formation rate ( upto 50% change ) , the physical properties related to the outflow do not vary significantly between these models . as mentioned earlier ,the physical properties related to the outflow do not vary significantly between these models .an for such distortions . conclusions about the molecular cooled models arrived at in paper  ii remain ; that they are more favorable in spreading the metals , without unduly distorting the lyman-@xmath223 forest . Theoreticallyin a series of papers ( paper i and paper ii ) we have been developing semi - analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies that are constrained by available observations on uv luminosity function and reionization . Theoreticallyour models successfully explained the observed uv luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 and predicted various effects of outflows form the galaxies on the metal enrichment of the igm . Theoreticallyin all these models one of the main ingredients is the halo mass function . Theoreticallywe used the standard ps mass function with the halo formation rate given by sasaki ( 1994 ) . however the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies at @xmath223 forest . Theoreticallythe halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies at @xmath223 forest . Theoreticallythe halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations formation rate . extingsuch a comparison is also important as the sasaki formalism is not easily generalizable to other mass functions . for all other halo mass functions one has to simply take recourse to its derivative , to model the net formation rate of halos . extingwe first show , by comparing the derivatives of all mass functions , that the historically used press - schechter mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function . extinghowever , all other mass functions do not differ significantly in the formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos . extingtherefore , significant differences can arise in model predictions made using the ps mass function and the other forms of the mass functions considered here . extingwe show the effect of this difference by ( i ) calculating the reionization history of the universe , ( ii ) fitting the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs , and ( iii ) calculating the feedback of star formation on the igm . extingthe main results of our study are as follows :     * in order to produce a given electron optical depth to the reionization , the efficiency in the star formation and/or in uv escape fraction has to be lower in the at the bright end ( right panel of figure  [ fig_uv_lf ] ) . suburthis is because as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects and the ps mass function predicts a lower net formation rate compared to the st mass function or other mass functions derived from simulations . suburthe uv luminosity functions determined from all mass functions , other than the ps mass function , agree reasonably with each other . suburthe uv luminosity functions calculated using the derivative of the ps mass function and that obtained from the sasaki formalism , differ negligibly for @xmath87 and by less than @xmath122 for other values of @xmath230 . suburthe uv luminosity functions determined from all mass functions , other than the ps mass function , agree reasonably with each other . suburthe uv luminosity functions calculated using the derivative of the ps mass function and that obtained from the sasaki formalism , differ negligibly for @xmath87 and by less than @xmath122 for other values of @xmath230 . suburthe uv luminosity functions calculated using the ps mass function and that obtained from the sasaki formalism , agree reasonably with each other . associated with outflows and the conclusions of paper ii appear to be largely insensitive to the adopted form of the halo mass function .    the next important step in the development of our models could be to implement it in the framework of a numerical simulation or by generating merger trees .    we hope thatthis will help in unambiguously determining the halo formation rate and its survival probability . . , heckman , t. m. , kauffmann , g. , 2006 , mnras , 368 , l67 bouwens r. , illingworth g. , 2006 , newar , 50 , 152 bouwens , r. j. , illingworth , g. d. , franx , m. , ford , h. , 2007 , apj , 670 , 928 bouwens , r. j. , illingworth , g. d. , franx , m. , ford , h. , 2008 , arxiv:0803.0548 bower , r. g. , benson , a. j. , malbon , r. , helly , j. c. , frenk , c. s. , aragon -

      "generated": "recent years , the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy has been extensively investigated within the framework of transport theories , such as the nordheim approach , in which the vlasov equation for the one - body phase space density , @xmath1 , is supplemented with a pauli - blocked boltzmann collision term @xcite .the basic ingredients that enter the resulting transport equation , often called boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation , are the self - consistent mean - field potential and the two - body scattering cross sections .these transport models hence describe the time evolution of the reduced one - body density in phase - space and , consequently , they are suited for the description of one - body observables , such as inclusive particle spectra in nuclear collisions , average collective flows and excitations . however , they can not provide a reliable description of fluctuation phenomena , such as multi - fragmentation processes , i.e. the break - up of excited nuclear systems into many pieces .in fact , neither fluctuations of one - body observables nor many - body correlations can be addressed with this class of mean - field models . hence suitable extensions , including fluctuations of the one - body density , have to be considered .in fact is represented by a simple product wave function , with or without antisymmetrization . embodimentsthe single particle wave functions are assumed to have a fixed gaussian shape . in this way , though nucleon wave functions are supposed to be independent ( mean - field approximation ) , the use of localized wave packets induces many - body correlations both in mean - field propagation and hard two body scattering ( collision integral ) , which is treated stochastically . embodimentshence this way to introduce many - body correlations and produce a trajectory branching is essentially based on the use of empirical gaussian wave packets . embodimentsif wave functions were allowed to assume any shape , the method would become identical to standard mean - field descriptions . embodimentswhile the wave function localization appears appropriate to describe final fragmentation channels , where each single particle wave function should be localized within a fragment , the use of fixed shape localized wave packets in the full dynamics could affect the correct description of one - body effects , such as spinodal instabilities and zero sound propagation @xcite . embodimentswhen the wave function localization appears appropriate to describe final fragmentation channels , where each single particle wave function should be localized within a fragment , the use of fixed shape localized wave packets in the full dynamics could affect the correct description of one - body amplified when instabilities or bifurcations occur in the dynamics . suburthis procedure is suitable also for addressing multifragmentation phenomena , since fragments can be associated with the regions where the spacial density becomes larger , which finally can be reconstructed by sampling the one - body distribution function . subura specific method for solving the boltzmann - langevin equation by direct numerical simulation was introduced in refs.@xcite . in this numerical implementation, the one - particle density @xmath3 is represented on a lattice of grid points in phase space and the collision integral is treated by considering all possible transitions between phase space cells , adding a noise term whose features are related to the average rate of transitions between two specified initial cells and two final cells . suburthe numerical implementation of this method has only been possible in two dimensions ( 2d ) because it requires too large computer resources in 3d . suburhence several approximate solutions of the bl equations have been formulated , mostly based on the projection of the bl noise only on a given dynamical variable ( such as the local quadrupole tensor of the momentum distribution ) or on @xmath4 space only @xcite . suburthe numerical implementation of this method has only been possible in two dimensions ( 2 , including fluctuations , would allow to improve the description of the fragment kinematical properties and correlations . suburwe also stress the general interest of this effort . suburindeed transport phenomena occur in many physical systems , for which a more precise description of the time evolution of the one - body distribution function , including the effect of many - body correlations , would be important . subura first attempt to introduce a fluctuating collision term in a 3d transport approach was made by bauer et al . suburthis method can be implemented relatively easily into standard transport codes that adopt the scattering of pseudo - particles ( or test particles ) as a method of solution of the collision integral and it consists essentially in forcing similar two - body collisions to occur for neighboring test particles , defined according to a given distance in phase space , so that effectively two nucleons are involved in each particular collision event . suburthe distance should reproduce the phase - space shape of the nucleon wave function . in this way that the pauli - blocking is checked for the entire cloud of moved particles . suburthe random nature of the two - body scattering , that in the standard codes applies only to test particles and is washed - out when using a huge number of them , is transferred to entire nucleons . however , in attention to the definition of the phase - space metric that would optimize the value of this variance .sectionthe paper is organized as follows : we will first recall the main ingredients of the bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthethen we will discuss in more detail the methods that have been proposed so far to solve the boltzmann -

langevin equation is accomplished by correctly simulating the basic stochastic process , i.e. the stochastic transition rate among phase - space cells . embodimentsone can realize that this point is very delicate in finite systems , when we work with a relatively small number of nucleons , but still need to build a smooth distribution function . embodimentsthere are different ways to overcome this difficulty .    as mentioned in the introduction , one possibility , proposed in ref.@xcite , is to solve of such transitions in a time step @xmath30 is dispersed around the mean value according to a poisson distribution , so its variance amounts to : @xmath31 where the average is given by : @xmath32 @xmath33[ni_med ] + this is a compact form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , since it predicts that the fluctuations are simply related to the mean number of dissipative processes . then , a noise term @xmath34 is added to the mean number @xmath35 , and thus the actual number of transitions is a random number picked from a normal distribution , the center of which is the mean value , and where the width is given by eq.([sigma_ni ] ) . in refs .@xcite this procedure is proven to yield correct results for a 2d system of fermions interacting through hard two - body scattering . in refs .@xcite this procedure is proven to yield correct results for a 2d system of fermions interacting through hard two - body scattering .starting from a non - equilibrium situation ( two touching fermi spheres ) the method is successful in reproducing the expected fluctuations , preserving also the average trajectory of the system . in particular , the fluctuations introduced the early fluctuations developed in momentum space are subsequently transmitted into density fluctuations and amplified by the nuclear mean field @xcite , leading to large instabilities and a statistical population of fragments .      the method of ref.@xcite was originally developed as a way to overcome the problems arising from the solution of transport equations with the test particle method , which we now discuss briefly . within the test particle method , each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . on the one side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side ,the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically divided by @xmath42 . on the other side ,the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically . suburthe jump from one configuration to the other is possible under the important assumption that any coherence between determinants can be ignored ( decorrelation approximation ) . suburthe jump from one configuration to the other is possible under the important assumption that any coherence between determinants can be ignored ( decorrelation approximation ) . suburthe choice of the single - particle basis for the determinant is however somewhat arbitrary , apart from the requirement of momentum - energy conservation . suburthese ideas can be translated into the semi - classical approximation using the test particle method . suburthe mixing between slater determinants is realized in the collision integral by means of the following procedure .    1 . suburfirst of all , the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross section is reduced by a factor @xmath42 . subur2 .   then two test particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 are chosen as colliding partners , and will be moved from their positions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , to new positions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , according to the corresponding transition probability including the pauli blocking of the final states @xcite . suburif the two particles can collide , the scattering actually involves two `` clouds '' of neighbouring cloud . suburwe will see in the following that this choice induces a strong violation of the pauli principle ; * the effect of the collision is a mere translation ( in momentum space ) of the two clouds to final positions , as sketched in fig . subur[ trasla ] . suburthis method is conceptually simple , and moreover the implementation into existing buu or bnv codes is really straightforward . suburindeed it was immediately used to test the effects of the fluctuations on fragment mass spectra in a @xmath54 reaction at @xmath55 @xcite . suburits validity has been checked later by chapelle et al . subur@xcite , for the same idealized 2d system for which the bl lattice simulation method was implemented . suburaccordingly , a different metric , involving only distances in momentum space , was used . as shown in @xcite , the final equilibrium value obtained for the fluctuation variance does not reproduce the expected one . the variance profile , as a function of the energy , appears to be proportional to @xmath56 rather than to @xmath57 . suburactually , this would be the result for a classical system , obeying to the boltzmann statistics . suburthis can be considered as a consequence of the present work , as we will discuss in the next section . suburthe method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems . suburthe method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems . suburhowever , a careful modification of the original procedure can considerably improve the results . suburthe new procedure can be summarized in the following steps :    1 . suburthe choice of the two colliding partners closely traces the standard recipe . suburif the two test particles are allowed to collide , two clouds of @xmath42 particles will be moved , with conditions specified below . subur2 .   only particles within a sphere , in coordinate space , around the center of mass of the two partners @xmath44 and @xmath45 can belong to the clouds . suburthe distance criterion is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a free parameter ( see later discussion ) . suburthen , for this considered space sphere , a grid is introduced in momentum space , around @xmath44 and @ this choice corresponds to the maximum of possible moves . nomine4 .   surrounding momentum space cells are searched with the same prescriptions , until two entire nucleons are found . nominethe search procedure is symmetric with respect to the center of momentum of the two partners and random in the vicinity of the original cells ( i , j ) . nominefinally , the two clouds are moved to the new states of the rotated frame ( see fig.2 ) , so that the conservation of energy and momentum is automatically obtained . nominehowever , a further check is performed . nominein fact , due to the finite number of test particles , the one - body density is not perfectly homogeneous inside each cell . nominethis causes slight violations of the conservations laws . nominehence the origin of the momentum space grid is eventually slightly displaced in order to have a perfect energy and momentum conservation . nominethis method involves two parameters , namely the radius of the sphere in @xmath69 space , @xmath59 , and the size of the momentum cells , @xmath60 . nominethe radius @xmath59 fixes the spatial extension of the nucleon , that in turn influences its spreading in momentum space . nominehence the origin of the momentum space grid is eventually slightly displaced in from the original method , where the nucleon is essentially spherical in phase space , here it is allowed to assume any shape in momentum space , since the only restriction is given by the cell size @xmath60 . in other words , it is possible to take into account momentum deformations of the nucleon wave packet , due to the momentum distribution of the system in particular conditions . in other words , the pauli principle allows collisions essentially for nucleons lying on the surface of the fermi sphere ; therefore such nucleons should not have a spherical shape in momentum space .it is also interesting to make a connection between the proposed method and the lattice simulation method to build fluctuations .    the numerical procedure described in ref . exting@xcite , where the phase space is discretized by a fixed grid of cells , allows to construct the correct value of the fluctuation amplitude in each cell of the grid , generally taken of volume @xmath40 ( but in principle it can be even smaller ) , on the basis of the fluctuating gain and loss terms . on the other hand , the contour procedure is based on a different philosophy : instead of constructing fluctuations in fixed cells , when a collision occurs we move all together the phase space volume containing one .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\@xcite , we build fluctuations in volumes containing one nucleon , but these volumes do not correspond to single cells of a fixed grid : instead , their contour changes from one collision to another , according to the prescription adopted to construct the clouds around the two first colliding test particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    but how can the two proposed methods be connected to the original bl equation ?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it should be noticed that the boltzmann - langevin equation ( [ ble ] ) is a semi - classical equation , derived in the `` continuum limit '' ( @xmath0 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this implies that the evolution of the system under consideration is completely determined by a smooth distribution function , i.e. it behaves as a fluid in phase space . in other words ,the volume @xmath71 of the phase space cells for which the fluctuating transition rate is evaluated , is supposed to be much larger than @xmath40 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the boltzmann - langevin equation is essentially based on the idea of a fluctuating collision rate among phase space cells containing many nucleons .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the formalism does not provide any additional information about the `` structure '' , i.e. the shape of the single nucle is also very interesting to investigate the differences between the various possible methods used to build the nucleon clouds , that in turn influence the correlation volume . In the present implementation of the method , one can try to force the procedure in order to reduce the wave packet smearing and to correlate particles inside smaller volumes ( close to @xmath40 ) .      in the present first implementation of the method , one can try to force the procedure in order to reduce the wave packet smearing and to correlate particles inside smaller volumes ( close to @xmath40 ) .      in the present first implementation of the method , we try to force the procedure in order to reduce the wave packet smearing ,similarly to what was done for the lattice simulations of ref.@xcite , we neglect the evolution in coordinate space , extending @xmath59 to the whole coordinate space . embodimentsthe cell size @xmath60 is then constrained by the following arguments : it should be small enough to allow an accurate check of the pauli blocking , but large enough to contain a sufficient number of test particles to reduce numerical uncertainties . in any case, @xmath60 has not to exceed the volume where , at most , one nucleon can be for simplicity , we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the total extension in momentum space of the system is @xmath81 . embodimentsthen the system is divided into @xmath82 smaller cells that can contain at most half nucleon , whose occupancy can be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . hence @xmath85 . the occupancy is randomly chosen at the beginning and collisions are performed until equilibrium has been reached . embodimentsthe initial ( @xmath86,@xmath87 ) and final ( @xmath88,@xmath89 ) states of a collision are chosen randomly among the @xmath90 cells . embodimentswe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple example . embodimentsmoreover , for simplicity , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively. hence only half of the considered space is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision to happen is proportional to the product @xmath93 . according to eq . embodiments( [ scaling ] ) , the expected fluctuation value , in a given momentum space volume @xmath76 , will be @x they can be rather far . of course , for practical reasons , we have to restrict our search within a given radius . for instance , considering 10 cells on each side ( with respect to @xmath95 ) , we are able to reconstruct the nucleon and to perform the collision in more than 98@xmath96 of the cases .these considerations would apply in the idealized case of particles moving only along one direction . ]    in fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ flu_joseph ] we present the results for the fluctuation variance as a function of the number @xmath97 of `` nucleon '' cells ( of volume @xmath98 ) that are contained inside the volume @xmath76 where the function @xmath2 is evaluated . the fluctuation value presented in the figure is multiplied by @xmath97 .as one can see in the figure , the correct value of the fluctuations , i.e. @xmath99 , is approximately recovered ( within @xmath100 ) for volumes @xmath101 .the slight deviation is due to the upper bound considered for the `` correlation radius '' and to the constraints imposed by the total mass conservation , that are also responsible for the decrease of fluctuations observed for large @xmath97 values . thus , in ref.@xcite , the comparison between the obtained fluctuation variances and the expected ones should have been done considering also volumes containing many nucleons , and not only cells of volume @xmath103 where , as seen in fig.[flu_joseph ] , fluctuations are naturally suppressed by the fact that the nucleon wave packet may take any shape at any time , i.e. however , this does not affect the conclusions drawn in @xcite , mainly based on the wrong profile of the density variance ( and not on its absolute value ) .    in the next section we will move to describe more complex geometries and different procedures to build the nucleon wave packets .    in the next section we will discuss our procedure to build fluctuations in the context of a system of fermions having a given density and temperature , i.e. initialized according to a fermi -

dirac distribution .    in ref.@xcite , we will of size @xmath98 , in order to probe the extension of the nucleon wave packet . suburthe latter could influence significantly the evolution of actual nuclear collisions , where it could be important to work with more compact nucleon configurations .    using this simple model , we will find that building the maximum fluctuation value ( e.g. @xmath107 ) in such a volume , i.e. correlating particles inside @xmath103 , is a quite difficult task and additional efforts are required in order to reduce the nucleon cloud smearing .       in order to keep the particles on the fermi surface , the original procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe procedure described in sect . suburthe modulus of the momentum of the particles does not change : only particles belonging to cells with opposite momenta can collide . suburthen , for symmetry reasons it will result @xmath , whose size is chosen to accommodate one nucleon at most , so that @xmath117 .attributewe have checked that the results do not depend on the number of cells , i.e. the number of nucleons considered , by performing the same calculations on a @xmath118 system .attributewe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon .attributewe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon .attributethe growth of fluctuations is described by the variance @xmath77 of the distribution function , as discussed before .attributeusually it is evaluated performing an ensemble average over a large number of events having the same initialization . however , in this scheme the mean value @xmath120 does not depend on the position @xmath5 and is not changing in time . considering the large number of cells employed , we can also follow the evolution of the system by calculating in a single event the following quantity : @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the average with respect to the cells and @xmath123 .       in order to understand how the recognition of the nucleon wave packet can be influenced by the details of our procedure ,attributewe first further simplify the problem by using a single fixed grid to make the collisions , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases , the only possible values for @xmath2 are @xmath83 , @xmath125 and @xmath84 .    the maximum fluctuations in @xmath103 ( @xmath107 )would be reached only if , in each cell , @xmath2 is either zero or one . embodimentsachieving this result is not a trivial task : cells starting with @xmath127 can be partially emptied , and cells with @xmath128 partially filled . embodimentsthe dot - dashed curve in fig.[full_esa ] , upper panel , shows the variance of the distribution function calculated in the cells of the fixed grid , with increasing number of collisions ( i.e. as a function of time ) . embodimentsit saturates approximately when almost all nucleons have suffered one collision . in the equilibrium configuration , the fluctuations reached in @xmath2 are roughly the same , as shown in fig . embodiments[ full_esa ] ( lower panel ) , so the fluctuation variance is @xmath129 , which is about @xmath130 of the maximum .     , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases : fixed grid with @xmath the fluctuations reached in @xmath103 also depend on the variance of the initial configuration . embodimentsif we initialize the system distributing the test particles randomly , the occupation in the cells has an average value @xmath132 and a width given by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the average number of test particles per cell ( @xmath135 ) . embodimentsthe distribution function can assume any value between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as shown by the full curve in fig . [ full_esa ] , lower panel . embodimentsthe initial continuous distribution of values of @xmath2 causes a reduction of the fluctuations in @xmath103 ( full curve in fig . [ full_esa ] , upper panel ) with respect to the previous case . embodimentsas expected , the fact that @xmath2 varies continuously between @xmath83 and @xmath84 contributes to enhance the smearing of the nucleon wave packet and hence to reduce fluctuations in @xmath103 . embodimentsnow we turn to a more general situation , relaxing the condition of the fixed grid . embodimentshence here we would like to test the full procedure , described in section 4 , that we will finally follow in the full 3d case . embodimentsas expected , the however , we checked that this violation concerns only about @xmath138 of the cells . embodimentssecond , the correlation between the cells representing the reconstructed nucleon , which is maximum in the search frame , will be systematically broken in another ( shifted ) reference frame , increasing the nucleon delocalization and thus reducing fluctuations in @xmath103 . embodimentsthe dashed curve in fig . [ full_esa ] shows the fluctuations obtained in @xmath103 in this case . since embodimentsthis feature is due to the arbitrary position of the centroid of the constructed nucleon with respect to a fixed reference frame , we will name it _ embodimentscentroid effect_. we notice a fluctuation reduction of @xmath139 with respect to the fixed grid case ( dash - dotted line in the same figure ) .       up to now, we notice a fluctuation reduction of @xmath140 with respect to the fixed grid case ( dash - dotted line in the same figure ) .      up to now, the step of the grid has been chosen so that @xmath140 . however , in general , the size of the search cell has to be smaller than @xmath103 , especially when the nucleon wave packet is rather del @xmath103 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . 神[ smallphi_full ] ) . 神, also shown in fig . 神[ full_esa ] . ] 神the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure . 神the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath145 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure . 神moreover , it further reduces for @xmath145 . 神nevertheless , this smearing effect is partly compensated by the fact that the procedure used to select the cells belonging to the nucleon clouds favours compact , symmetric configurations . 神it is interesting to evaluate the effect of the use of a small search cell on the fluctuations also in the general case , i.e. when the fixed grid condition is relaxed . 神intuitively , we expect a small effect on the variance , as long as @xmath146 is not too small : the main reduction of fluctuations comes already from the _ centroid effect _ 神( see previous subsection ) , which is equivalent to an infinitely small step . 神in fact , the differences between calculations with @xmath85 and @ locating the initial and final cells of the colliding test particles would help to increase the value of the variance in @xmath103 .attributehowever , energy and momentum conservation would not be exact , due to the phase - space discretization .attributehowever , the standard test particle method allows a good mapping of the phase space and a good resolution of the average collision integral , with perfect energy and momentum conservation .attributehowever , when constructing fluctuations , the _ centroid effect _ may destroy the correlations already built and increase the nucleon cloud smearing .attributehowever , the expected statistical value of the fluctuation variance is recovered in large volumes .attributethis last point has been checked for all the simplified situations considered here ( fermi surface ) .attributefor instance , this analysis is shown in fig.[fluct_new ] in the case of the fixed grid with @xmath140 and test particles randomly distributed inside the system ( last case of section 5.2 ) .    ) as a function of the number @xmath103 , obtained in the fixed grid case with @xmath103 , obtained in the fixed grid case with @xmath147 and test particles randomly distributed . ]    here fluctuations are evaluated in volumes @x development of fluctuations starting from this initial distribution . in our simplified 2d scheme, we can mimic the two spheres using a `` chess - board '' initialization , that is subdividing our momentum space in four regions where @xmath2 is alternatively zero or one . embodimentsalthough the system is in a non - equilibrium situation , the variance , defined as in eq.([sigmaf ] ) , starts from its maximum value ( since @xmath149 ) . embodimentsit can be shown that in the fixed grid case the equilibrium configuration consists of a random distribution of full and empty cells , and the variance keeps constant in time . however, when the system is in a non - equilibrium situation , the variance starts from its maximum value (since @xmath149 ) , and the variance keeps constant in time . embodimentswhen the system is in a non - equilibrium situation , the variance decreases because the initial correlation is destroyed by the _physicalcentroid effect_.    as an illustrative example , we plot @xmath77 for the choice @xmath150 , fixed grid . embodimentscomparison with the corresponding curve for the configuration @xmath151 ( dashed , see section 5.4 ) shows that the two calculations converge to the same value . embodiments( by the simplified schematic cases illustrated above , let us now discuss the full case of a nuclear fermi gas of particles at a given temperature and density interacting through hard two - body scattering . as in the previous examples , since we focus on fluctuations in momentum space , only one large cubic cell is present in coordinate space , and all particles can be chosen to collide ( no restrictions in @xmath69 space ) . in these calculations , we consider the size of the box is @xmath152 , and we consider @xmath153 nucleons , so that the density has the saturation value @xmath154 ; each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath119 test particles . besides , we do not consider any distinction between neutrons and protons , so that one nucleon occupies at least a phase - space volume @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) . in these calculations , we consider the volume @xmath60 , so that the density has the saturation value @xmath156 ( @xmath156 ) . in these calculations , we consider a cube of side @xmath60 , so that one nucleon occupies at least a phase - space volume @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) . in these calculations , we consider changes are observed , probably due to the finite extension of the nucleon packet , that induces a discretization of the phase space . in the following section ,we investigated the region in @xmath5 space , at the time @xmath162( solid ) and at the time @xmath161 ( dashed line ) . ]   we also compared the average collision rate with analytical expectations : we find that the number of collisions is slightly larger than the analytical one , but differences are within @xmath162 ; on the other hand , similar deviations are also found in usual buu implementations , due to the approximate mapping of phase space induced by the finite number of test particles . in the following section ,we analyze in more detail the capability of the procedure to build the fluctuations in the considered 3d scenario . in the following section ,we investigated the region in @xmath5 space where collisions are most probable and the extension of the nucleon cloud . from the left panel of fig .10 , right ) and from the right panel of fig .10 ,[ polar ] it is evident that most collisions involve nucleons lying on the surface of the fermi sphere , as expected .besides , the right panel illustrates the extension of the clouds in the radial @xmath169 , as expected . . .we notice also that the tail of the distribution ( fig.10 , right ) extends up to large @xmath170 values , @xmath171 . . . we notice also that , although the nucleon clouds extends , on average , over a volume @xmath172 , that is not much larger than @xmath103 , the _ centroid effect _ , i.e. the fact that the nucleon centroid may be located anywhere , causes a significant smearing of fluctuations , as already discussed in section 5 . , as expected . , as expected . , as expected . , as expected . , as expected . , as expected .in fact , we find

@xmath173 .    , in cubic cells of size @xmath103 , for a fermi gas at equilibrium . ]    in the following , to test our procedure , we will evaluate fluctuations considering big volumes , that contain many nucleons .    , in cubic cells of size @ [ spicchi_p ] we fix the angular spread , @xmath178 , and we consider four different steps , @xmath177 , corresponding to different volumes , i.e.

considered geometry , while this can be achieved in the angular coordinates , this can not be easily obtained along the @xmath188 direction without losing locality for the value of @xmath2 and related

from the distribution of values of @xmath2 plotted , for the same two simulations of fig.16 , in fig .escription[ opt_dndf_full ] .    in the end embodiments, this procedure helps the nucleon packets to keep a similar , one nucleon each , as proposed in ref.@xcite . however , while in the original procedure the pauli blocking was checked only for the centroids of the nucleon clouds , here we

is close to the upper bound , the scaling of @xmath168 deviates from a power law already at @xmath143 . suburif we assume that the exponential growth in the time constant is not compensated by the decrease in the coefficient , this contribution will be even more pronounced when @xmath117 is increased further . suburwe finally come to the comparison between the hmc and thmc algorithm , and we show the reduction in autocorrelation time achieved through the introduction of the field transformation . in fig . subur[ fig:7 ] we plot the ratio of the autocorrelation of our observables for the

that exponentially slow modes will at some point affect other observables of the theory . psychiatthe deviation at @xmath172 from the scaling behavior , which we observe for the observables up to a

posed inverse problem is thus defined for the reconstruction of the signal @xmath103 from the measured visibilities @xmath104 : @xmath105 where the matrix @xmath107 identifies the complete linear relation between the signal and the visibilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the matrix @xmath107 is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the matrix @xmath108 is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the unitary matrix @xmath109 implements the discrete fourier transform providing the fourier coefficients 113 . suburthe residual noise level estimator , defined as twice the negative logarithm of the likelihood associated with @xmath112 , reads as @xmath114 with @xmath115 , and where @xmath116 stands for the standard deviation of the noise component @xmath117 . suburthis noise level estimator follows a chi - square distribution with @xmath17 degrees of freedom . suburtypically , this estimator should be minimized by the good candidate reconstruction . suburthe measurement constraint on the reconstruction may be defined as a bound @xmath118 , with @xmath119 corresponding to some percentile of the chi - square distribution . suburlet us note that the expectation value of the @xmath120 is equal to its number of degrees of freedom @xmath17 , while its standard deviation is @xmath121 . in other words , for a large number of degrees of freedom the distribution is extremely peaked around its expectation value . suburthis fact is related to the well - known phenomenon of the concentration of measure @xcite . as a consequence , the value @xmath119 is anyway extremely close to @xmath17 .      in this context , the value @xmath119 is anyway extremely close to @xmath17 yquist - shannon sampling , denoted by the vector @xmath122 . nominea real orthonormal basis @xmath123 is also considered , in which the decomposition @xmath124 of the signal is defined by @xmath125 the signal is said to be sparse or compressible in this basis if it only contains a small number @xmath126 of non - zero or significant coefficients @xmath127 respectively .     secondly , the signal is assumed to be probed by @xmath17 real linear measurements denoted by a vector @xmath100 in some real sensing basis @xmath128 and possibly affected by independent and identically distributed noise @xmath101 . nominethis defines an inverse problem @xmath129 where the matrix @xmath130 identifies the sensing basis as seen from the sparsity itself . nominethe number @xmath17 of constraints is typically assumed to be smaller than the dimension @xmath17 of constraints is typically assumed to be smaller than the dimension @xmath12 of the vector defining the signal , so that the inverse problem is ill - posed . nominethe framework proposes the global @xmath15 minimization problem for the signal recovery . nominethis problem regularizes the originally ill - posed inverse xmath141 for a scalar @xmath142 stands for the complex modulus when applied to a complex number and the absolute value when applied to a real number . embodimentsthe @xmath131 problem is solved by application of non - linear and iterative convex optimization algorithms @xcite . embodimentsthe @xmath134 norm term in the @xmath131 problem is identical to a bound on the @xmath120 distribution with @xmath17 degrees of freedom governing the noise level estimator .      among other approaches embodiments@xcite , the theory of compressed sensing defines the explicit restricted isometry property ( rip ) that the matrix @xmath143 should satisfy in order to allow an accurate recovery of sparse or compressible signals @xcite . in that regard , embodimentsthe issue of the design of the sensing matrix @xmath144 is of course fundamental . embodimentsthe theory offers various ways to design suitable sensing matrices , showing in particular that a small number of measurements is required relative to a naive nyquist - shannon sampling : @xmath14 . embodimentsone can actually show that incoherence of @xmath144 should satisfy in order to allow an accurate recovery of sparse or compressible signals @xcite . in that regard when the sparsity and sparsity bases are identified by sparsity basis vectors corresponding to the lines of @xmath147 and the columns of @xmath145 are denoted by @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the mutual coherence between the bases reads as : @xmath150 in other words this mutual coherence identifies with the maximum complex modulus of the fourier coefficient values of the sparsity basis vectors . [ [ cs5 ] ]note that the inverse of the mutual coherence , @xmath151 , can also be called the mutual incoherence between the fourier and sparsity bases .    in this context ,the rip is already satisfied for a small number of measurements satisfying the constraint @xmath152 for some constant @xmath153 . under this condition , between @xmath154 and @xmath155 the sparsity recovered @xmath16 is maximum for signals sparse in real space . [ [ cs5 ]note that the @xmath131 reconstruction of signals well approximated by a @xmath16 sparse signal is shown to be accurate and stable relative to noise as well as relative to compressibility , in the sense of a departure from exact sparsity . [ [ cs5 ]note that the mutual coherence in a dictionary of gaussian waveforms , and explicitly identify our sensing dictionary for radio - interferometric measurements . nominewe compute the theoretical coherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries as a function of the chirp rate and of the size of the gaussian waveforms , which suggests the universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary . nominewe define an observational set up , and describe our simulations and specific reconstruction procedures . nominewe finally expose the results of the analysis , and comment on the need for future work along these lines . nominewe consider simple astrophysical signals sparse in a dictionary of gaussian waveforms , all with equal and fixed size given by a standard deviation @xmath161 . nominethese signals are assumed to be probed by radio interferometers with a gaussian primary beam @xmath162 with a size identified by a standard deviation @xmath163 . nominethe corresponding matrix thus reads as @xmath164 . the value @xmath165 sets the size the field of view of interest , which must naturally be larger than the size of the gaussian waveforms : @xmath166 . nominewe consider a small field of view and baselines with a non - negligible constant component @xmath9 , of linear measurements might in fact also allow accurate signal reconstruction in the context of compressed sensing @xcite .    in this context ,the interferometric inverse problem ( [ ri4 ] ) simply arises from a uniform random selection of spatial frequencies with a sensing dictionary @xmath168 also parametrized by the size @xmath165 of the gaussian waveforms of size @xmath22 may be denoted by @xmath169 .attributethe sensing dictionary as seen from the sparsity dictionary itself therefore reads as @xmath170 .attributelet us emphasize the fact that the sparsity dictionary is obviously not an orthogonal basis .attributemoreover , the sensing dictionary does not correspond anymore exactly to a random selection of vectors in an orthogonal basis .attributethe sensing dictionary as seen from the sparsity dictionary as seen from the sparsity dictionary itself therefore reads as @xmath170 .attributethe sensing dictionary as seen from the sparsity dictionary itself therefore reads as @xmath170 .attributelet us emphasize the fact that the sparsity dictionary is obviously not an orthogonal basis .attributemoreover , the sensing dictionary does not correspond anymore exactly to a random selection of vectors in an orthogonal basis .attributeno precise compressed sensing the decomposition of the matrix @xmath173 into modified sensing and sparsity dictionaries , respectively @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in this perspective, the mutual coherence @xmath176 identifies with the maximum complex modulus of the fourier coefficient values of the modified sparsity dictionary vectors , which depend on the chirp modulation and on the primary beam . in this perspective, the mutual coherence @xmath176 identifies with the maximum complex modulus of the fourier coefficient values of the modified sparsity dictionary vectors , which depend on the chirp modulation and on the primary beam .consequently , the requirement for a lower coherence can be fulfilled by an operation that spreads the two - dimensional sample power spectrum of the signal in the fourier plane , while preserving its norm .attributethe relation ( [ ssu1 ] ) is valid both for finite @xmath12 as well as in the continuous limit @xmath159 . in this continuous limit , the coherence is strictly positive : @xmath159 .analyzing the evolution of the coherence as a function of the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath165 , and @xmath9 is very enlightening .attributefirstly , we consider finite non - zero absence of chirp , i.e. in the presence of a chirp , i.e. for @xmath179 , the coherence is strictly positive : @xmath180 . in the presence of a chirp , i.e. for @xmath180 , the coherence is strictly positive : @xmath180 . in the presence of a chirp , i.e. for @xmath180 , the coherence is strictly positive : @xmath180 . in the presence of a chirp , i.e. for @xmath180 , the spectrum is spread by means of the corresponding convolution in the fourier plane , while the norm of the signal multiplied by the primary beam is preserved . this spread spectrum phenomenon reduces the coherence which , in light of relation ( [ cs5 ] ) , should enhance the quality of the @xmath131 reconstruction in the context of compressed sensing . in the limit of an infinite chirp rate @xmath9 , the coherence also tends to its minimum null value independently of the size @xmath22 of the gaussian waveforms : @xmath183 this limit provides a strong result in the sense that the incoherence lost by considering a sparsity [ c ] [ t ]   [ c ]     real part ( left panel ) and imaginary part ( right panel ) of the chirp modulation with @xmath184 assumed in the simulations . the chirp is sampled on a grid of @xmath185 pixels in order to avoid any aliasing artifact .

[the quality of reconstruction is analyzed in terms of the signal -to - noise ratio of the reconstructions multiplied by the primary beam @xmath224 , and we use it explicitly as sparsity dictionary : @xmath225 . as a consequence ,the @xmath224 problem deals with the best possible sparsity value @xmath188 . p modulation are respectively denoted by @xmath231 and @xmath232 . embodimentsbut the mutual coherence here remains unaffected by the chirp modulation , so that this modulation should fail to enhance the reconstruction quality in this case . embodimentsthis analysis structure is strongly suggested by our interest in understanding the behaviour of the standard reconstruction algorithms used in radio interferometry . embodimentsthis analysis structure is strongly suggested by our interest in understanding the behaviour of the standard reconstruction algorithms used in radio interferometry . embodimentson the one hand , the standard clean algorithm is essentially a matching pursuit ( @xmath233 ) algorithm @xcite which works by iterative removal of the so - called dirty beam , i.e. the inverse fourier transform of the mask , in real space @xcite . embodimentsit is also known that clean provides reconstruction qualities very similar to what we just called the @xmath229 approach @xcite . on the other hand , multi - scale versions of clean can in principle account for the fact that the signal may be sparser in some multi - scale dictionary @xcite . embodimentsassuming that the signals considered have a very sparse expansion in such dictionaries , the corresponding performances would probably be very close to that of our @xmath224 approach , @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms and each number of visibilities measured @xmath93 , the @xmath227 reconstruction exhibits a significantly better @xmath234 than the @xmath231 reconstruction . suburthis suggests that for the signals considered it is better to optimize the sparsity by accounting for the proper dictionary , than to optimize the mutual coherence by formally postulating that the signal lives in real space . suburit also appears that , for each number of visibilities measured @xmath93 , the @xmath234 of both kinds of reconstructions significantly degrades when the size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms increases . suburthis behaviour is due to the fact that either the mutual coherence , in the case of @xmath227 , or the sparsity , in the case of @xmath231 , get farther from their optimal values . suburthirdly , the @xmath234 of the @xmath231 and @xmath232 reconstructions remain undistinguishable from one another at @xmath96 standard deviation , independently of the size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms and of the number of visibilities measured @xmath93 . suburthis illustrates the fact that either the mutual coherence , in for any number of visibilities measured @xmath93 and for large enough size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms , the @xmath234 of the @xmath228 is significantly larger than that of the @xmath227 reconstruction .attributethis is the spread spectrum phenomenon related to the reduction of the mutual coherence in the presence of the chirp modulation .attributethis is the spread spectrum phenomenon related to the reduction of the mutual coherence in the presence of the chirp modulation .attributemoreover , the @xmath234 of the @xmath228 reconstruction is essentially independent of the sparsity dictionary identified by @xmath204 .attributethis supports very strongly the principle of universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary , in perfect agreement with our theoretical considerations .attributethe reconstruction quality also appears to be more stable around the mean @xmath234 values in the presence of the chirp modulation .    finally , let us note that our pure considerations on sparsity and mutual coherence led to relation ( [ ssu3 ] ) , which suggests the spread spectrum universality and associated optimal reconstructions in the @xmath224 setting in the limit of an infinite chirp rate . in practice , a higher chirp rate @xmath236 , in both the @xmath224 setting and the @xmath235 setting . in the @xmath224 setting , the @xmath234 of reconstruction ( not shown in fig . exting[ fig : all ] ) undergoes a natural continuous increase for values @xmath237 from the @xmath227 curve to the @xmath228 curve , confirming the spread spectrum phenomenon for all values of @xmath204 and @xmath17 considered . extingthe saturation of the @xmath234 occurs around @xmath184 , and its degradation is for example already significant for a chirp rate @xmath236 , for @xmath206 and all values of @xmath17 considered . in the @xmath235 setting , the @xmath234 of reconstruction ( not shown in fig . exting[ fig : all ] ) exhibits no evolution for values @xmath237 , independently of the values of @xmath204 and @xmath17 considered , confirming the fact that the chirp modulation has no impact on the mutual coherence . extinghowever , the leakage phenomenon obviously also affects the reconstructions . extingthe corresponding degradation is observed in the same conditions as for the @xmath224 . subura large range of multi - scale dictionaries , notably wavelet frames , may be used in which a large variety of natural signals are known to be sparse or compressible . suburlet us however acknowledge the fact that a non - optimal choice of a sparsity dictionary will of course have an effect on the sparsity and possibly degrade the reconstruction . suburin this perspective , further analyses should be performed in order to assess the suitability of specific dictionaries .    for signals with sparse or compressible gradients , a tv norm may be substituted for the @xmath132 norm of the coefficients in the sparsity dictionary , in the very definition of the minimization problem . suburthe tv norm of a signal is simply defined as the @xmath132 norm of the magnitude of its gradient @xcite . subura theoretical result of exact reconstruction holds for such tv norm minimization problems in the case of fourier measurements of signals with exactly sparse gradients in the absence of noise @xcite . but suburno proof of stability relative to noise and compressibility exists . subursuch minimization is also accessible through an iterative scheme from convex optimization algorithms @xcite . even though our signals would not primarily be thought to have very sparse gradients , the the number of visibilities measured @xmath93 , before saturating around some multiple of the sparsity @xmath188 . embodimentsthis suggests a selection procedure in cases where the total number of visibilities measured is very large relative to the sparsity considered . embodimentsif a suitable fraction of visibilities is associated with the suitable coverage of frequencies @xmath94 in the fourier plane and with a suitable identical value of @xmath9 , only these visibilities might be retained in the problem . embodimentsin such a case , our present considerations could apply directly . embodimentslet us also recall that the value @xmath184 requires a strong alignment of the baselines with the pointing direction for small fields of view , possibly corresponding to an unrealistically large component @xmath9 . in this respect ,the @xmath228 reconstruction results are asymptotic values . embodimentshowever , a given baseline component @xmath9 will actually correspond to a larger @xmath211 on a larger field of view @xmath211 on a larger field of view @xmath238 and for a given band limit @xmath208 , so that @xmath184 will become more realistic . embodimentsthis is actually the exact opposite argument to the one used for the definition of fac discussed the sensitivity of imaging techniques relative to the sparsity dictionary in the context of the theory of compressed sensing . a theoretical computation of the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries , as well as the results of our numerical simulations , suggest the universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary , in terms of the achievable quality of reconstruction through the @xmath131 problem .the authors wish to thank l. jacques for productive discussions as well as m. j. fadili for private communication of results on optimization by proximal methods .the authors also thank the reviewer for his valuable comments .y. w. is postdoctoral researcher of the belgian national science foundation ( f.r.s .- fnrs ) .y. b. a postdoctoral researcher funded by the apidis european project .y. b. a postdoctoral researcher funded by the apidis european project .the authors wish to thank l. jacques for productive discussions as well as m. j. fadili for private communication of results on optimization by proximal methods .y. b. is postdoctoral researcher of the belgian national science foundation ( f.r.s .- fnrs ) .y. b",

type coupling , i.e. , @xmath88 . suburnote that in this case , the coupling is not frustrated [ i.e. , @xmath77 ] so that the optimal choice of natural frequencies of the linearized system are precisely the natural frequencies , @xmath78 [ see eq . subur( [ eq : theory02 ] ) ] . suburfurthermore , we will consider as an illustrative example kuramoto - type coupling , i.e. , @xmath88 . subur find that @xmath92 can be minimized by placing as much weight as possible into the @xmath0-th singular vector coefficient @xmath93 . suburhowever , since the collection of left singular vectors @xmath71 tend to have non - zero mean , an additional shift is required to ensure that @xmath94 . suburit is straightforward to show then that the optimal choice of natural frequencies is precisely @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the mean entry of the @xmath97 left singular vector . suburthus , the optimal choice of frequencies is proportional to the dominant left singular vector @xmath98 with a shift to retain a mean of zero . suburwe now demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal solution given by eq . subur( [ eq : theory14 ] ) in comparison to a random allocation of natural frequencies . specifically , we consider both er and sf networks of size @xmath99 with mean degree @xmath99 with ( i )  the optimal choice given in eq . subur( [ eq : theory14 ] ) with @xmath99 and ( ii )  a set of natural frequencies drawn randomly from the standard normal distribution . suburwe consider 50 networks each of type er and sf , and for each network we range of coupling strength , leading to strong synchronization ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) even for very small @xmath6 . suburnext we consider oscillator arrangement . here we consider the optimal solution for minimizing the saf . suburwe assume that an underlying network structure is given , but rather than choosing natural frequencies freely ( i.e. , as in sec . subur[ sec3sub1 ] ) , we are given a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies @xmath19 that must be arranged on the network . in general , the optimal solution depends on the particular network structure and set of natural frequencies given , making analytical treatment impossible . suburspecifically , since there are @xmath103 possible arrangements , it is infeasible to conduct an exhaustive search for the best arrangement even for a moderately sized network . suburwe thus develop a computationally feasible solution for minimizing the saf . suburwe propose here a simple greedy algorithm to produce an approximation of the optimal solution . suburinitially , we arrange the set of natural frequencies ( here chosen from the standard normal distribution ) randomly on the network . then , in each step , we propose a switch of a single pair of oscillators , @xmath104 , obtain a new frequency vector @xmath105 uramoto ] ) on er and sf networks before and after the natural frequencies are rearranged using the algorithm above . suburwe consider again networks of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 and @xmath101 , first arranging normally distributed natural frequencies randomly , then rearranging them with @xmath110 proposed switches . suburwe plot the resulting synchronization profiles in fig . subur[ fig1](b ) , indicating the random and rearranged natural frequency results with blue circles and red triangles , respectively . suburwe again denote er and sf networks with filled and unfilled markers . as in the case of oscillator allocation ,the system with rearranged natural frequencies significantly outperforms the system with randomly arranged natural frequencies . comparing to the results of optimal allocation that are shown in fig . subur[ fig1](a ) , in the case of pre - chosen natural frequencies the abrupt transition to synchronization occurs at a larger coupling strength ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) and the order parameters are generally smaller . suburnevertheless , as in the case of optimal arrangement , the order parameter curves in both fig . subur[ fig1](b ) significantly outperforms their random counterparts . suburwe now consider the problem of network construction . suburwe assume that with a random network . suburwe begin by constructing a random network with @xmath112 links around the pre - chosen natural frequencies , which we ensure to be strongly - connected . suburnext , we propose link rewiring : uniformly at random , we select a link @xmath81 to delete , and we replace it with a new link between two previously disconnected nodes @xmath114 , which are also selected uniformly at random . suburthis yields a new directed laplacian matrix , @xmath115 , and new saf , @xmath116 . suburif the new saf is less than the previous saf , @xmath117 , then the link replacement is accepted , and otherwise it is rejected . as before , this process is repeated until @xmath108 proposed rewirings are considered . suburwe highlight the effectiveness of this method by simulating the dynamics of eq . subur( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) on networks before and after the iterative rewiring process . suburwe initialize the rewiring algorithm with both er and sf networks of size @xmath118 and mean degree @xmath100 and @xmath101 with normally distributed frequencies , and propose @xmath119 link rewirings . suburwe highlight principle , the initial network structure may have an effect on the final network . embodimentshowever , we find that initializing the algorithm with er and sf networks yields very similar results , which suggests that the network initialization does not have a significant effect on the outcome of the rewiring process . embodimentshaving demonstrated the effectiveness of the generalized saf for optimizing a network s synchronization properties , we next investigate the role of directed network structure in the optimization of synchronization . in particular , we consider two general questions . embodimentsfirst , what are the effects _ of _ various directed network structures _ on _ optimal synchronization ? embodimentssecond , what are the effects _ of _ optimal synchronization _ on _ directed network structures ? embodimentswe address these questions below in secs . embodimentshaving demonstrated the effectiveness of the generalized saf for optimizing a network s synchronization properties , we next investigate the role of directed network structure in the optimization of synchronization . in particular , we consider two general questions . embodimentsperhaps the property that differentiates directed from undirected networks is the characterization of each node by two degrees rather than one ( specifically , the in- and out - degrees @xmath121 and @xmath122 for a given node @xmath5 ) . embodimentswe address these questions below in secs . embodiments indicates no correlation . suburthe results presented in sec .  [ sec3 ] and fig . suburthe results presented in sec .  [ sec3 ] and fig . suburthe results presented in sec .  [ sec3 ] used random networks with no correlations between in- and out - degrees . suburthis begs the question : what is the effect of degree assortativity on optimal synchronization ? suburwe investigate the effects of assortative and disassortative degree correlations on optimal synchronization in the cases of oscillator allocation and arrangement . suburin particular , given the sequence of in- and out - degrees for a particular network , we construct two new networks using in- and out - degree pairs set to maximize and minimize the degree assortativity . suburmaximum assortativity is obtained by matching the maximum in - degree with the maximum out degree , etc . , and maximum disassortativity is obtained by matching the maximum in - degree with the minimum out - degree , etc . . suburbeginning with er networks of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 , we plot the synchronization profiles @xmath14 vs @xmath6 of the original network ( dashed curves ) and its assortative ( blue circles ) and disassortative cases . suburinterestingly , we find that the effect of degree assortativity on synchrony optimization differs between the cases of optimal allocation and optimal arrangement . suburin particular , we observe that in both er and sf networks when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform assortative networks [ see fig . exting[ fig2](a ) and fig . exting[ fig3](a ) ] . however , when oscillators are optimally arranged , assortative networks tend to outperform disassortative networks [ see fig . exting[ fig2](b ) and fig . exting[ fig3](b ) ] . suburthus , we conclude that positive / negative degree assortativity in directed networks does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem . suburhowever , we do point out that these tendencies do not appear to depend much on network heterogeneity , since the results for er and sf networks are similar . suburnext , we investigate the effect that optimization has on a given directed network s structure . in particular , we consider the case of network rewiring and study the evolution of the degree distribution @xmath129 for both in- and out normal distribution ( as used above ) , representing a homogeneous collection of frequencies . practitionsecond , we consider frequencies drawn from a much broader , heavy - tailed distribution described by @xmath133 which represents a symmetric ( continuous and piecewise - smooth ) distribution on @xmath134 that is uniform for @xmath135 and has a power - law decay with exponent @xmath136 for @xmath137 . we choose frequencies drawn from a much broader , heavy - tailed distribution described by @xmath140 , which is uniform for @xmath141 and has a power - law decay with exponent @xmath136 for @xmath137 . we choose frequencies drawn from a much broader , heavy - tailed distribution described by @xmath138 and @xmath139 . we choose frequencies drawn from a much broader , heavy - tailed distribution described by @xmath140 , plotting the degree distributions @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the initial networks in panel ( a ) in blue circles and red triangles , respectively , and the resulting distributions after rewiring for optimal synchronization for the cases of normal and heavy - tailed frequencies in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . embodimentsresults represent an average over @xmath128 rewiring experiment that the heterogeneity of the degree distribution of an optimized network roughly matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution  heavy - tailed frequency distributions give rise to heavy - tailed degree distributions , and thin frequency distributions give rise to thin degree distributions . nominethe results for directed networks provide an interesting contrast to this phenomenon . nominethe results for directed networks provide an interesting contrast to this phenomenon . nominein particular , the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . nominethis suggests that in the case of directed networks , in - degrees play an important role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . as we will see below , the role of in- and out - degrees extend to the correlations we observe between the degrees and frequencies of neighboring oscillators . nominehaving investigated the effects of directed network structure on optimal synchronization , and vice versa , we now consider the relationship between the structural and dynamical properties of optimal networks . nominein particular , _ what _ relationships between dynamical and structural properties promote synchronization in directed networks ? in our previous work  @xcite , we observed two general properties that are common to undirected synchrony - optimized networks : compare to the relationship between out - degrees and frequencies ? to address this question , we study the system properties of synchrony - optimized networks resulting from the optimization of the general saf . in sec . 神[ sec5sub1 ] , we study correlations between oscillators natural frequencies and their nodal in- and out - degrees . in sec . 神[ sec5sub2 ] , we study correlations between oscillators natural frequencies and their nodal in - and out - degrees . in sec . 神[ sec5sub2 ] , we study correlations between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators . 神we begin our investigation by considering correlations between each oscillator s nodal in- and out - degree , @xmath121 and @xmath142 , with their respective natural frequency in absolute value , @xmath143 . 神we present results for synchrony - optimized networks arising for the optimization problem of rearranging a set of pre - chosen frequencies on a given network ( see sec .  [ sec3sub2 ] ) ; however , we emphasize that these results are in close agreement with our study of networks resulting for the other optimization problems discussed in sec . 神[ sec3 ] .    in fig . 神[ sec5sub2 ] , we show relationship is clear between natural frequencies and out - degrees . to support this observation , we calculate the assortativity coefficient between the respective quantities , @xmath144\\left[\\sum_{i}(|\\omega_i|-\\langle|\\omega|\\rangle)^2\\right]}}.\\label{eq : corr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that in our particular example , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .      next , we consider the relationship between natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators . we note that in the directed case , this relationship is more nuanced than in the undirected case , and therefore we consider the relationships between a given oscillator s natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors ( i ) along in - coming links and ( ii ) along out - going links . to investigate these relationships , we define the mean neighboring frequencies , respectively , as @xmath147 physically , the mean in - frequency for oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath148 represents the mean frequency of all the oscillators that _ influence _ oscillator @xmath5 , while the mean out - frequency for oscillator @xmath5 , @x is reminiscent of the frequency - frequency relationship that we previously observed for undirected networks  @xcite . to quantify this structure , we count the fraction of pairs @xmath150 that fall into each quadrant , which we indicate in the respective corners of fig .  [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) . suburthis allows us to quantify the proportion of oscillators whose natural frequency shares their sign with the frequencies opposite incoming and outgoing links . suburapproximately @xmath151 of the natural frequencies share a sign with their respective mean in - frequency , while @xmath152 share a sign with their respective mean out - frequency . suburthis finding suggests that the relationship between each natural frequency and its respective mean in - frequency has a more significant effect on synchronization than the relationship with its respective mean out - frequency . suburfinally , we investigate the evolution of a network s properties during the optimization process . suburagain , we restrict our attention to oscillator arrangement , as discussed in sec . subur[ sec3sub2 ] , and we thus consider the evolution of a network through a process of switching the natural frequencies . throughout this evolution , we will consider the correlation between both in- and out - degrees and natural frequencies , measured by the assortativity coefficient in . subur[ fig7](b ) , we plot the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in blue , red and green , respectively . subur( we note that these also align from top to bottom , respectively . ) suburresults represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations . for comparison , we plot the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath157 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in blue , red and green , respectively . suburresults represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations . for comparison , suburresults for a single realization are plotted as gray curves . suburour main observation is that as more switches are proposed , we see a rapid shift in the saf , @xmath155 , and @xmath157 , but only a slight shift in @xmath156 . as the network s synchronization properties improve , the correlation coefficients @xmath155 and @xmath157 quickly saturate to approximately @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively . suburin contrast , @xmath156 remains small in comparison , but is on average positive . suburin contrast , @xmath156 remains small in comparison , but is on average positive . suburthese findings [ i.e. , either eq .   or eq .  ] , and is based on an objective measure of synchronization ( i.e. , a perturbation analysis of the kuramoto order parameter ) and not heuristics . embodimentsthe generalized saf approach presented here shows that the synchronization properties of a general directed network depends on the alignments of the natural frequency vector with the left singular vectors of the laplacian , weighted appropriately by the left singular values . in particular , the alignments of the natural frequency vector with the left singular vectors of the laplacian promote synchronization . embodimentsstronger synchronization is attained as the natural frequency vector becomes aligned with dominant singular vectors , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values . embodimentsthis is a natural generalization from the undirected case , where it was found that stronger alignments of the natural frequency vector with the more dominant eigenvectors of the laplacian promote synchronization . embodimentswe emphasize that our approach is designed to maximize the kuramoto order parameter in the regime where strong synchronization may occur , but point out that even for relatively small coupling strengths the approach works remarkably well . embodimentswe also point out that the method is not designed to minimize the critical coupling strength distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees . in the undirected case ,we have also studied the relationship between structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks . in the undirected case, it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization . in the directed case ,we have shown that these relationships become more nuanced in the directed case ; synchronization is promoted by a positive correlation between the nodal in - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency , while the relationship between the nodal out - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency has comparatively little effect . in the directed case ,we also studied correlations between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators and found that directed synchrony - optimized networks display a stronger relationship between each natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links than its neighbors along out - going links . taken together , these results indicate that in - degrees play a significant role in the synchronization properties of directed networks , while out - degrees are much less significant .       99 s. h. strogatz , _ sync : the emerging science of spontaneous order _ ( hypernion , 2003 ) . 2003 ) .

      "reference": "background and objectiveepidural corticosteroid injections ( esis ) have been used for several decades and now represent the most common intervention performed for the management of back pain with a radicular component . however , several reports have presented devastating complications and adverse effects , which fuelled concerns over the risk versus clinical effectiveness . the authors offer a comprehensive review of the available literature and analyse the data derived from studies and case reports.methodsstudies were identified by searching pubmed medline , ovid medline , embase , scopus , google scholar and the cochrane library to retrieve all available relevant articles . publications from the last 20 years ( september 1994 to september 2014 ) were considered for further analysis . studies selected were english - language original articles publishing results on complications related to the technique used for cervical and lumbar esis . the studies had to specify the approach used for injection . all studies that did not fulfil these eligibility criteria were excluded from further analysis.resultsoverall , the available literature supports the view that serious complications following injections of corticosteroid suspensions into the cervical and lumbar epidural space are uncommon , but if they occur they can be devastating.conclusionsthe true incidence of such complications remains unclear . direct vascular injury and/or administration of injectates intra - arterially represent a major concern and could account for the vast majority of the adverse events reported . accurate placement of the needle , use of a non - particulate corticosteroid , live fluoroscopy , digital subtraction angiography , and familiarisation of the operator with contrast patterns on fluoroscopy should minimise these risks . the available literature has several limitations including incomplete documentation , unreported data and inherent bias . large registries and well - structured observational studies are needed to determine the true incidence of adverse events and address the safety concerns .",

[ 25 , 189 ] reported an incidence of fluoroscopically confirmed intravascular penetration of 19.4  % for cervical tesis , 8.1  % for lumbar tesis and 21.3  % for tesis at the s1 level .    in addition , sullivan et al .   suggested that intravascular  uptake is twice as likely to occur in patients over rather than under 50  years of age .    in terms of intravascular  uptake , vascular embolic events from intra - arterial injection of particulate corticosteroids have been found to account for serious complications including spinal cord infarction , paraplegia and death [ 93 , 100 , 102 , 103 , 105 ] .   in addition , houten et al .   presented three cases of paraplegia which ensued suddenly after instillation of the corticosteroid solution in the artery of adamkiewicz .    in terms of intravascular  uptake , it should be mentioned that intra - articular injections pose a higher degree of danger , while venous uptake has been considered benign [ 193 , 194 ] . in terms of the injectate ,   it has been suggested that , damage can occur via toxicity of the carrier or the corticosteroid . � based on several observations that failed to highlight any difference in the efficacy of particulate and non - particulate corticosteroids , we would recommend the use of soluble non - particulant agents [ 196198 ] . � a transient blockage of the neural conduction is expected ; however , the reported central canal , conus medularis and cauda equina syndromes must have an underlying cause , i.e. hematoma , infarct , etc . � transient systemic reactions including headaches , vasovagal reactions and facial flushing have been reported ; these reactions occurred shortly after the esi and could represent a reaction to the injected anaesthetic agents and/or corticosteroids . � it is rather unclear whether esis pose a long - term risk of certain conditions and whether a cumulative effect of prolonged exposure exists . � if that is true , epidural corticosteroids could have similar systemic effects to that of long - term corticosteroids administered through other routes . � for instance , a significant number of the patients with chronic back pain conditions are treated with repeated injections over prolonged period of time . � it .   showed that following esi with dexamethasone a profound decrease in the serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) occurs .      .   showed that hypertension can also occur following esis ; a mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5  mmhg has been previously reported following esis . a blunt needle and the suggestion that a small  test dose of the medication should be inject initially has been proposed [ 204207 ] .   in a case report , dynamic live fluoroscopy was found to perform better than static intermittent fluoroscopy , which was found to miss 57  % of the intravascular injections .   in a case report , digital subtraction angiography can be used as a radiologic adjunct to identify vascular compromise during the injection . however , in a case report by chang et al .   in a case report , an anaesthetic test dose and digital subtraction angiography performed twice did not prevent a catastrophic spinal cord infarction and the resultant paraplegia .   in a case report by chang et al .   in a case report by chang et al .   in a case report , an anaesthetic test dose and digital subtraction angiography performed twice did not prevent a catastrophic spinal cord infarction and the resultant paraplegia .   in a case report , it is under debate whether the transforaminal route poses a higher risk of serious complications when performed by an experience physician .   given the lack of evidence , one could argue that it is reasonable to consider the trans syndromes",

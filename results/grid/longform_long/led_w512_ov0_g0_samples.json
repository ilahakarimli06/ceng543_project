fit model compared to the data , with the corresponding parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] . embodimentswe found that the uncertainties in the fit are dominated by the systematic errors , while the statistical errors are negligible since the source is bright and the deep exposure provides a high signal - to - noise ratio image . embodimentsit is obvious that our simple model captures only the characteristic features of the pwn , hence the unmodeled structure contributes to the systematic uncertainties . following @xcite , we attempted to quantify this term by blanking out the jet regions in the fit ( the dotted ellipses in fig . embodimentsin addition , we also tried fitting only part of the arc by excising the sectors in fig . embodimentsthe change in the parameters indicates how sensitively the results depend on a particular region icates the count rate measurement .williamtherefore we estimated the flux from the ccd readout trail which is due to the ` out - of - time images ' during the @xmath26s frame transfer time from one row to another .williamwe employed a rectangular region of 3  width centered on the trail , and selected regions far away from the pwn to avoid any contamination .williamwe tried different background regions and obtained a net count of @xmath27ctsrow@xmath7 in 1 -

8kev band for the first and second epochs respectively . suburthe 3% difference is entirely due to the scattering of pulsar counts in the same field - of - view . suburwe generated a model psf without any pile - up effects , and found that the above region contains 3.5% of the point source counts . suburtherefore , the increase in the pulsar luminosity can easily explain the excess counts in the pwn.ctss@xmath7 ]    on the other hand , some small - scale features in the pwn do demonstrate significant variability between the observations . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . subur[ f4 ] clearly show the evolution of the northern clump and the brightening of the southern inner jet . in the 2006 data , the northern clump broadens and the southern inner jet narrows , while the northern clump broadens and the southern inner jet narrows . suburshows a double peak feature . suburthe count profiles in fig . suburthe count profiles in fig . suburthe southern inner jet also shows hints of morphological evolution : there is an obvious eastern extension at the end of the jet in the 2006 exposure , but it seems to be absent icates a 3% difference , which is in an excellent agreement with the count rate estimate in the above section .    to determine any spectral variations in the overall pwn between the epochs , we refitted both data sets with the column density fixed at @xmath36@xmath35 , in order to avoid any possible covariance between @xmath37 and other spectral parameters .the results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , indicating no systematic changes in the spectral indices between the observations , and the fluctuation is mostly within the measurement uncertainties .the results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , indicating no systematic changes in the spectral indices between the observations , and the fluctuation is mostly within the measurement uncertainties .the results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , indicating no systematic changes in the spectral indices between the observations , andthe results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , indicating no systematic changes in the spectral indices between the observations .on the other hand , the table suggests flux variations in regions 1,2,6,9,12 , and 14 .the change in region 6 is introduced by the shift of the northern clump into the region . for region 12 ,the apparent flux increase is the result of puls as the northern clump shows a double peak structure in the 2006 observation , we further divided the extraction region to determine any spectral difference from the two peaks .the best - fit spectral parameters with 90% confidence intervals are listed in table  [ tab4 ] .the spectral properties vary substantially between the structures . to check if this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation . to checkif this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath shown in fig . suburwe rebuilt the response matrix files ( rmfs ) with the tool ` mkacisrmf ` which corrects for the cti , and employed the @xcite model in the fitting to account for the ccd pile - up effects . suburagain , for the 2006 observation , the spectra were extracted from individual exposure and then fitted jointly . suburwe did not attempt to fit the column density , as this could be complicated by the pile - up effects and by any possible thermal emission from the pulsar . suburinstead , it was fixed at the pwn value @xmath39@xmath35 in the analysis . suburalso , due to contamination from the surrounding compact nebula , a simple background subtraction with an annuli region may lead to inaccurate pile - up estimate . suburhence , we fit the source spectrum with a two - powerlaw model : one for the background and the other one for the pulsar . suburthe former is fixed at the best - fit spectrum of region 12 ( see fig . subur[ f6 ] ) and we scale its amplitude according to the spatial modeling in  [ s31 ] . suburwe found that the compact nebula provides 0.05ctss@xmath7 ( 1 - shorter frame time . comparing the individual spectrum in the 2006 observation shows no short - term flux or spectral variation for the pulsar at this time . as a check for consistency , we convert the above results to the un - piled count rates for the pulsar plus the nebular background .the inferred count rates in the 1 - 8kev band are 0.17 and 0.77ctss@xmath7 for the 2000 and 2006 observations respectively .the inferred count rates in the 1 - 8kev band are 0.17 and 0.77ctss@xmath7 for the 2000 and 2006 observations respectively .this is in good agreement with the independent estimate from the readout trails in the previous section .we also note that our results are mostly consistent with the values reported by @xcite and @xcite , but the pulsar spectral index for the first epoch is slightly lower than the value reported by @xcite .the difference is probably the result of improvements in the pile - up model .    in order to look for any thermal emission from the neutron star, we have tried adding a blackbody component to the fits . as shown in table  [ tab3 ] , the pl+bb model provides a better fit to the 2006 data in the pulsar spin - down of @xmath55yr implies a nebula field of @xmath56 g @xcite .

The pulsar spin - down of @xmath55yr implies a nebula field of @xmath56 g @xcite . The pulsar spin - down of @xmath55yr implies a nebula field of @xmath56 g @xcite . The pulsar spin - down of @xmath55yr provides a better handle on the magnetic field @xcite . in a one zone model assuming all the tev photons come from inverse compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the x - ray and @xmath3-ray fluxes are related to the energy densities of of pwn evolution within an expanding snr suggest that during the first @xmath67 years , a pwn expands freely into the surrounding ejecta before the supernova reverse shock is reached ( e.g. * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin. given the young age of kes  75 , the pwn is likely to be in the free expansion phase .the expansion of light pulsar wind materials into the dense supernova ejecta could result in rayleigh - taylor instabilities .this may be associated to the protrusions in the pwn boundary , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula @xcite . this may be due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn .alternatively , the protrusions in the north could also due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn . although a comparison to optical observations will help to identify the nature of these structures, this may not be observationally in general, we do not expect any significant synchrotron emission inside the termination shock . in this case , the compact nebula surrounding the pulsar could be a result of particle injection from previous outbursts . the synchrotron cooling timescale for a particle emitting at @xmath77kev in the nebula is @xmath78 if an outburst occurs every decade , as suggested by @xcite , then based on the timescale , this could possibly power the emission of the compact nebula .    as an alternative to the pulsar, one could identify the compact nebula as a termination shock . in our case ,the smaller radius @xmath79 only requires a slightly larger magnetic field in the nebula and the ambient pressure is still much lower than the thermal pressure in the rims . in this scenario ,the arc - like feature could be interpreted as an analogue to the outer arc in g320.41.2 powered by psr b150958 , which @xcite argue is a wisp in the equatorial outflow based on the particles flowing timescale . in our case ,the flowing timescale from the compact nebula to the arc - like feature is @xmath80 which is shorter than @x the pwn .the slightly softer spectrum in the innermost bin could be due to the injection of lower energy particles from any pulsar bursts in the past , or simply because the next two bins are contaminated by the polar outflow which has a harder spectrum .the jet - like features along the pwn symmetric axis show systematically harder spectra than their surroundings , indicating a large velocity in the polar outflow , i.e.  @xmath83 .the jet - like features along the pwn symmetric axis show systematically harder spectra than their surroundings , indicating a large velocity in the polar outflow , i.e.  @xmath83 .if the absence of a counter inner jet in the north is due to doppler boosting , then its detection limit provides an estimate of the flow speed .the flux ratio between the inner jet and its expected counterpart is given by @xmath84 @xcite .the flux ratio between the inner jet and its expected counterpart is given by @xmath84 @xcite .the flux ratio between the inner jet and its expected counterpart is given by @xmath85 @xcite .from the the best - fit inclination angle @xmath85 and the photon index @xmath86 for the jet , the angle between the direction of motion and the observer line of sight . as @xmath100 , this places an upper limit @xmath101 .the best - fit pulsar spin axis inclination @xmath102 indicates that the observed variability in the jet could not be explained by any superluminal motion in the polar outflow . for any emission in a random direction that beamed towards the earth with @xmath103 , there is an additional constraint for the alignment with the jet direction on the plane of the sky .the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @xmath103 .the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @xmath104 .given the two epochs separate by 6 years , we could not distinguish whether the inner jet variability is due to mhd instability as is possibly so in the cases of vela and psr b150958 jets @xcite , or simply due to the recent bursts . a similar argument also applies to the northern clump . due to the strong magnetic field and compact size of the inner jet , the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @x in the clump . suburthe one in the north is less obvious , which could be due to projection effects . comparing to other pwn systems, a similar scenario has been proposed to associate the x - ray features in rcw  89 with psr b150958 @xcite . suburthe difference in our case is that the clumps are found on both sides and much closer to the pulsar . suburbesides , the clumps are likely to be non - thermal . also , due to the younger age of kes  75 , the jets would encounter a cold ambient medium which has not yet been heated up by the supernova reverse shock . suburif we compare to other astrophysical jets ( e.g. * ? ? ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? - ray efficiencies for the pulsar and the pwn . suburthe new distance estimate of 6kpc greatly reduces the pulsar luminosity by an order of magnitude . suburnow the pulsar has an x - ray efficiency @xmath109 , which is no longer an outlier , but rather typical among young neutron stars ( see * ? ? ? * ) . for the pwn , the pulsar has an x - ray efficiency @xmath110 , which is not exceptional , but rather typical among young neutron stars ( see * ? ? ? * ) . for the pwn ,the luminosity @xmath110ergss@xmath7 and efficiency @xmath111 are still larger than many others , but not exceptional . also , @xmath112 is close to the mean value of 4 obtained by @xcite . suburour results indicate that the x - ray properties of psr j18460258 in quiescence are not much different from an ordinary young neutron star s . suburas compared to the crab pulsar , psr j18460258 has a higher surface magnetic field but its nebular field is much weaker . suburthis seems to imply no direct correlation between the magnetic field strengths on a neutron star surface and in its surrounding xmath118 to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle @xmath119 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the spatially resolved spectrum of the pwn shows that regions along the jet direction have systematically harder spectrum than the surroundings , suggesting a high velocity in the polar outflow .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also deduce a minimum flow velocity of 0.4@xmath1 based on the non -

@xmath6 is the matrix element of the corresponding transition . in this way,the presence of boundaries ( e.g. , in the case when the atom is inserted into a high-@xmath0 microwave cavity ) changes the local density of field modes and thereby the spontaneous emission can be suppressed or enhanced . in this way,the atom can be suppressed or enhanced by the presence of other atoms which can take part in absorption and re - emission of the radiation field . in this also analyze how the dynamics of an initially excited atom is modified in the presence of other initially deexcited atoms in the cavity which play the rle of a dielectric ( see section  [ sec5 ] ) and we study in detail the time evolution of atomic populations and quantum - statistical properties of the multimode cavity field .in particular , in section  [ sec6 ] we focus our attention on the spectrum of the field .in addition we will also discuss specific technical questions such as the rle of the frequency cut - off employed here .in section  [ sec7 ] we present the convolutionless master equation describing the dynamics of the initially excited atom in dielectrics interacting with multimode cavity field .in section  [ sec7 ]we summarize our results in section  [ sec8 ] .in section  [ sec7 ]we consider a simple one - dimensional model of a cavity in which two - level atoms interact with the cavity modes in the dipole and the rotating - wave approximations . to simplify the model ,we neglect all mechanical effects of the cavity field on the atom ( i.e. , the mass of the atom is assumed to be infinite ) .in section  [ sec8 ]we summarize our results in section when the radius of the atom is much smaller than the wavelength of the resonant electromagnetic radiation then the atom - field interaction can be described within the electric - dipole approximation , i.e. , @xmath24 . neglecting for simplicity all polarization effects , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath24 . neglecting for simplicity all polarization effects , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ,the resulting interaction hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) reads @xmath25 , \\label{hint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pauli spin - flip operators are @xmath26 and @xmath27 . embodimentsthe position dependent coupling constants @xmath28 are given by the expression g_n^(j ) = ( ) ^1/2 d_eg^(j ) ( k_n r_j ) [ lambda ] where @xmath29 denotes the dipole matrix elements of the atoms . embodimentsthe position dependence of the atom - field coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) given by space iphonethe position dependence of the kutta methods .alternatively one can apply the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) . numerical solution allows us to investigate processes with low initial excitation numbers ( e.g. initially just one or two atoms are excited ) .attributethe number of cavity modes can in this case be thousands and the total number of atoms can be up to hundreds .    using numerical methods , we can analyze the time evolution of the mean values of the following observables : the occupation of the upper level of the @xmath34-th atom _ e^(j)==|e_je| .attributethe amplitude of the electric field ( r)=_n=1^n()^1/2 ( k_n r ) .attributethe number of excitations of the @xmath35-th mode ( k)= ^_k_k , [ spec1 ] which is used to study the spectrum of the radiation . to analyze the space - time propagation of radiation wave packets we evaluate mean values of the normally - ordered operator for the energy density @xmath36 here normal ordering ( the colons above ) is adopted to eliminate the vacuum - state contribution to the energy density of the emitted radiation . by the fermi golden rule ( [ golden ] ) , i.e. , p_e(t)=(-_a t ) , _-a= [ decay1 ] , _-a= [ decay1 ] .in 1d `` free '' space ( @xmath37 ) the decay process is accompanied by the emission of two wave packets ( representing the one - photon state ) propagating to the left and to the right from the atom . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions in 1-d ( this corresponds to spherical symmetry in 3-d ) the emission of two wave packets propagates to the left and to the right from the atom . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions in 1-d ( this corresponds to spherical symmetry in 3-d ) the emission of two wave packets propagates to the left and to the right from the atom .when the atom is positioned at the center of the cavity it is coupled only to odd modes of the field ( for even modes the coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) is equal to zero ; for more details see below ) . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions bowing to the position dependence of the atom - field coupling ( [ lambda ] ) the even modes start to interact with the atom and the interaction with the odd modes decreases . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see '' the cavity mirrors . in other words , the atom does not `` see , then after the second reflection they accumulate a phase difference of @xmath50 so the corresponding poincar recurrence can then be seen ( i.e. in this case the atom needs an elapsed time which is twice as long compared with the situation when @xmath51 to `` see '' the cavity mirrors ) .    for the case of an atom positioned at @xmath52the evolution of the atomic inversion is almost indistinguishable from the case where @xmath53 . at the time of appearance of the first poincar recurrence,there is a constructive interference of the wave packets .   the trivial phase shift @xmath50 results from the difference of the geometrical paths which is then equal to @xmath54 .    in the case of an atom positioned at @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 and the first poincar recurrence is intermediate between the extreme cases ( @xmath57 ) considered above .    for the case of an atom positioned at @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 .    for the case of an atom positioned at @xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 and the xmath61 of the total hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) : a poincar recurrence , i.e. , a partial restoration of the initial state , can appear at time @xmath62 such that the relation @xmath63 is valid for many values of @xmath35 ( for more details see @xcite ) .    in fig . subur[ fig1 ] we present a stroboscopic set of plots describing the space - time propagation of the energy density of the cavity field for the same physical situation ( initial state ) as considered in fig . subur[ fig1 ] when the atom is in the center of the cavity . suburwe see two distinct wave packets propagating to the right and to the left . suburreflection of the wave packets from the cavity mirrors ( at time @xmath64 ) is nicely demonstrated and the subsequent re - excitation of the atom is synchronized with the interference of the wave packets in the center of the cavity ( compare with fig . subur[ fig1 ] ) . suburin the previous section we have considered situations when the atom is `` far '' from the cavity mirrors [ i.e. @xmath41 ] and the wave packets reflected by the mirrors do not directly affect namely , for the atomic positions @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( here @xmath73 ) we clearly see that the closer the atom is to the mirror the slower the spontaneous decay is , that is the inhibition of spontaneous radiation is transparent for the considered positions of the atom . on the other hand for very specific atomic positions close to the mirror the opposite effect - the _ enhancement _ of spontaneous emission - takes place .namely , for the atomic distance @xmath74 the atom decays as @xmath75 , i.e. , it radiates twice as fast compared with the free - space case [ see the reference case @xmath68 ] .namely , for the atomic positions @xmath74 the atom decays as @xmath74 the atom decays as @xmath75 , i.e. , it radiates twice as fast compared with the free - space case [ see the reference case @xmath68 ] .namely , for the atomic positions @xmath74 the atom decays as @xmath74 , i.e. , it radiates twice as fast compared with the free - space case [ see the reference case @xmath68 ] .namely , for the atomic positions @x the mirror larger than the wavelength of the resonant transition @xmath54 the interference with the reflected wave packet can either stimulate or suppress the emission of the atom .the cavity qed system with trapped atoms in the cavity .the cavity qed system with trapped atoms in the cavity .the cavity qed system with trapped atoms in the cavity .the cavity qed system with trapped atoms in the cavity .[ fig3 ] the time evolution of the population of the upper level of the atom which is positioned at three distances @xmath89 ( dashed line ) ; @xmath90 ( dotted line ) ; and @xmath91 ( dashed - dotted line ) ; and @xmath91 ( dashed - dotted line ) which are compared with the exponential decay of the atom in the cavity center ( solid line ) . [ fig4 ]the phase accumulated by the wave packet during the round trip from the atom to the neighboring mirror and back is in the case @xmath89 equal approximately to @xmath92 ( here the additional contribution of @xmath49 is due to the reflection from the mirror ) , i.e. there is a destructive interference between the wave packet and the atom which results in the suppression of the radiation . on the other hand , the wave @xcite represents a quite new experimental system . suburthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . suburthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . suburthe modification of the spontaneous emission of the atom embedded in a linear `` crystal '' of two  level atoms is shown in fig . suburthe regular crystal built of @xmath96 atoms fills the central part of the cavity . suburinitially the only excited atom is located at the cavity center and decays in the vacuum field . suburthe modification of the spontaneous emission depends dramatically on the interatomic distance @xmath97 . in the case of the `` lattice '' constant being @xmath98 ( long dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous emission while for @xmath99 ( short dashed line ) an enhancement of radiation compared with the single atom system ( dotted line ) takes place . suburthe origin of this behavior is related to either destructive or constructive interference effects , respectively . from other examples , for @xmath100 ( solid line ) and @xmath101 ( dot  dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous of the initially excited atom when the atoms are regularly positioned with the lattice constant @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , representing enhancement ( suppression ) of radiation with respect to the `` free - space '' decay ( solid line ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the results of numerical simulations corresponding to averaging over many ( 100 ) random configurations of atoms are presented for the average distance between atoms @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) . in both cases the radiation of the atom is suppressed compared with the `` free - space '' decay .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\another common feature of the dynamics in this case is that in both cases the atom does not radiate away completely the initial excitation energy .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\both effects ( suppression of radiation and `` excitation trapping '' ) are caused by the collective influence of the crystal atoms .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\an increase of the density of the linear `` crystal '' ( e.g. for @xmath101 ) rapidly diminishes differences between the regular crystal and the corresponding `` random '' crystal with one atom randomly positioned within the lattice constant . for completeness, we included in fig.[fig5 ] also the case of the regular `` crystal '' with @xmath98 ( ) and the average over random configurations with results partially resemble the case of the single atom in the vicinity of a mirror ( compare fig . subur[ fig4 ] with fig . subur[ fig4 ] with fig . subur[ fig2 ] ) . suburwithin the framework of cavity qed when the field interacting with the atoms is confined within ideal mirrors , there is nothing like a stationary regime which is necessary for the derivation of a time - independent spectrum of the field . suburthe spectrum is intrinsically time dependent . in this case, it should be stressed that there is nothing like a stationary regime which is necessary for the derivation of a time -

therefore a higher than solar metallicity is not a suitable reference point .ghostthe number density of gas and solid species comes from a gibbs free energy chemical equilibrium calculation ( described in seager et al . practition( 2000 ) ) which specifies the species abundance as a function of temperature and pressure .shieldthe opacities for h@xmath6o , ch@xmath7 , na , k , and pressure - induced h@xmath6-h@xmath6 and h@xmath6-he and mgsio@xmath8 are used . note that h@xmath6o is the most important gas in determining the temperature - pressure structure due to stellar irradiation .shieldfull references for the opacities used are listed in seager et al .shieldnote that our more recent work ( seager & sasselov in preparation ) shows that use of more recent opacities results a similar temperature - pressure structure to the one used here ( seager & sasselov , in preparation ) , certainly similar enough for the goal of this paper . with a self - consistent solution for the vertical temperature - pressure profile in a plane many other uncertainties in the atmospheric models . embodimentshigh - temperature condensates such as mgsio@xmath8 , al@xmath6o@xmath8 , and fe are stable at the expected cegp atmosphere temperatures and pressures ( see e.g. , seager et al . );these high - temperature condensates form clouds , just as water ice does here on earth . embodimentsthese clouds present a major complication for egp modeling because the strong condensate opacity is highly sensitive to the composition and size distribution of particles . embodimentsthe size distribution is determined by a number of physical processes that compete for grain growth and grain destruction , including condensation , coalescence , sublimation , and sedimentation . embodimentstwo recently developed cloud models ( ackerman & marley 2001 ; cooper et al . warr2003 ) aim to predict particle sizes and are meant to be used consistently in a model atmosphere that determines the temperature , pressure , and radiation field ( e.g. , marley et al . warr2002 ) . nevertheless even these cloud models are used in homogeneous layers , not patchy clouds that may exist , and the models still have other uncertainties . embodimentswe use the results of such computations as a basic guide for our choice species . species .species .species .species .species .species .in addition , mgsio@xmath8 is likely to be the `` top '' cloud that the stellar photons will reach first .species .species .species .species .species .species .species.this is because mgsio@xmath8 is likely to be the lowest - temperature condensate at the relevant cegp temperatures .    for comparison we use a second fiducial model of a cloud - free planet where the scattering is due to rayleigh scattering mostly from gaseous h@xmath6 .species .species .species.the case of no condensates on the dayside may be realized in some cases of atmospheric circulation where condensates are transported to a much cooler night side where they settle out permanently from the atmosphere ( guillot & showman 2002 ) . for more details of the temperature - pressure profiles and the corresponding emergent spectra ,see seager & sasselov ( in preparation ) .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species .species . 400 nm to 750 nm and we have chosen ten wavelength bins to represent this bandpass ( based on the planet atmospheric spectrum generated in  2.1 ) .    _the initial coordinates and trajectory _ of the photon must also be generated .    _the starting coordinates are produced by generating random @xmath14 , @xmath15 coordinates on a disk of the same radius as the planet .     _the egps with measurable scattered light curves will have semi - major axes within 0.1 au ;

guillot et al . 1966 ; guillot et al . 1966 ).the stellar atmosphere may also be affected by tidal interactions with the cegp .the stellar atmospheres may also be affected by tidal interactions with the star .combined with the back scattering of light from the planet , the stellar atmospheres could potentially have a flux hot spot with a rotational variation of the same period as the planet s rotational period .the stellar atmospheres could potentially have a flux hot spot with a rotational variation of the same period as the planet s rotational period .although stellar back heating is expected to be a small effect , it could be important because it would share the same period as the planetary light curve .    to investigate the magnitude of the back heating effect we construct an approximate model , based on the results of the monte carlo code . from the distance between the planet and the star , a light curve is produced for each ring using the limb darkening profile of the star .attributethe profile is constructed using an approximation for solar limb darkening ( carroll & ostlie 1996 ) .attributethe profile is constructed using an approximation for solar limb darkening ( carroll & ostlie 1996 ) .attributethis limb darkening approximation has good agreement with measurements averaged over the visible spectrum .attributethe increase in stellar flux is spatially integrated over the stellar disk for each time interval . because of the small size of the scattered light ratio and @xmath47 , our estimate shows back heating to be a small effect ( on the order of 10@xmath33 ) compared to the @xmath48 cegp light curve .attributethe increase in stellar flux is spatially integrated over the stellar disk for each time interval .attributethe increase in stellar flux is spatially integrated over the stellar disk for each time interval .attributethe variation in filling factor and contrast of the granulation pattern is also an important noise source in ultra - precise photometry of solar - type stars .attributethe level of granulation noise is correlated with chromospheric activity , which in turn depends on stellar rotation rate , surface magnetic activity , as well as depth of the surface convection zone per million in integrated optical broadband light ( see , e.g. , kjeldsen & bedding 1998 ) . suburwe have been guided by this in our simulations , since ground based photometry of other solar - type stars does not set useful upper limits on the granulation noise at relevant frequencies . suburmost is a small optical telescope ( aperture = 15 cm ;

( e ) slight variations in readout - channel gain ; and ( f ) uncertainties in the integration times .    in our simulations , by far, the dominant sources of noise are poisson statistics ( photon noise ) and stellar granulation . practitionthe photon noise in the @xmath0 botis simulations shown in  5 is at a level of 0.74 ppm ( 1@xmath37 ) . if granulation noise is included in the simulations , the 1-@xmath37 noise rises to 1.40 ppm . practitionthe other noise sources turn out to be negligible for the timescales associated with cegp scattered light curves . practitionhowever , for addition of stellar back heating was found to be negligible even for space - based photometry of precision 1 ppm .ghosttypically , stellar back heating contributed a flux ratio of @xmath68 or less .ghosttypically , stellar back heating contributed a flux ratio of @xmath68 or less .ghostthe effect of tidal distortion was slightly larger than back heating .ghostthe tidal distortion alone can change the scattered flux of a planet at 0.045 au from 0.9956 at minimum projected area to 1.0022 at maximum area , where 1.0 is the undistorted value .ghostthe effect of tidal distortion was slightly larger than back heating .ghostthis translates to an additional variation of @xmath69 about the mean in the light curve .ghostalthough treatment of both these effects was approximate , our initial estimates suggest that their influences will not be detectable in most observations of extrasolar planets .ghosthowever , they could be important diagnostics in data from later space missions like kepler and eddington with improved sensitivity and long - term stability .ghosttherefore , we have retained these effects in our models .    given that the orbital inclinations , radii and atmospheric structure and compositions are unknown for most extrasolar planets , it is important to understand light curve ( figure 3b ) . as the semi - major axis increases , the angular size of the star as viewed from the planet decreases . as a result , beyond 0.07 au distinct features of the phase function of the star ( see figure 3b )become visible because they are not `` washed out '' by multi - directional photon trajectories ( see figure 2 ) .the light curve model does allow for changes in the incident flux and angular size of the star as seen from the planet in the case of a non - circular orbit .attributehowever , modeling the change in the planet atmosphere as a function of its changing temperature in an eccentric orbit is much more complicated .attributehow temperature variations will also affect the photon wavelength distribution and the level of tidal distortion .attributehowever , only close - in extrasolar planet systems with nearly circular orbits have been selected as most primary targets so the current assumptions of zero eccentricity are valid .attributethe outputs of the extrasolar planet light curve model described in  2 and  3 were used as the inputs to the most photometric simulation program described in  5.2 .attributethe light curve model gives the intrinsic variability of the ( star + planet ) system as seen from above the earth s atmosphere , while the phot stray light and temperature due to orbital modulation . in these simulations , we have adopted a granulation noise amplitude and spectrum comparable to the sun ( see  3 ) . embodimentsthe simulated photometry for @xmath0 botis observed at an orbital inclination of @xmath72 is presented in figure 5 , showing the unbinned data ( filled symbols ) and the same data binned into groups of 100 min each ( open symbols ) . embodimentsthe modulation of the flux due to the extrasolar planet orbit orbital period is just barely discernible by eye in the data presented in this form . embodimentsthe periodic modulation becomes more obvious in figure 6 , where those data have been binned in phase according to the known orbital period of @xmath0 botis b. also shown in this figure are the original input models for the three different inclinations modeled . embodimentsthe binned data clearly follow the input model appropriate for this data set .       the detection and characterization of the planet scattered light variation is even more obvious in fourier space . in figure 5 , we showthe periodic modulation becomes more obvious in figure 6 , where those data have been binned in phase according to the known orbital period of @xmath0 botis b. also shown in generated a more complete grid of models sampling orbital inclination @xmath75 , for two planet radii ( 1.1 and 1.5 jupiter radii ) , and plotted the fundamental and harmonic peak amplitudes as a function of orbital inclination @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : harmonic ] ) . embodimentsthis figure also quantifies our ability to detect light variations for various inclinations and radii ( for our fixed fiducial model atmosphere ) . embodimentswe show in figure 8 a very conservative detection limit of 4.2 ppm ; this is @xmath76 the mean noise level , corresponding to about 99.7% confidence . embodimentswe emphasize that the detection threshold given in figure 8 is extremely conservative , based on the detection of signal peaks in amplitude ( not power ) whose frequencies are not known a priori . in a power spectrum , the signal - to - noise evident in figure 8 would be squared , but we prefer to present amplitude spectra to err on the side of caution . also , we will know in advance the frequencies of the fundamental orbital period and its harmonics , so the standard @xmath77 detection limit is a severe overestimate . embodimentswe emphasize that the detection threshold given in figure 8 is extremely conservative , based on the detection a specific fiducial atmospheric model of the planet @xmath0 botis b ( described in  [ sec - atm ] ) . extingother atmosphere models will result in different light curve shapes and amplitudes ; however , the condensate size distribution we have adopted is plausible for a quiescent atmosphere ( ackerman & marley 2001 ; cooper et al . 2003 ) . extingthe parameter space of cegp atmospheric unknowns is so large at present ( see  [ sec - uncertainties ] ) that a full exploration is beyond the scope of this initial study . extingmost will soon return real data , either measuring the albedo and the cegp light curve shape , or setting a meaningful upper limit . extingthis will greatly narrow the allowed range of parameter space of atmospheric models .    using our fiducial model for @xmath0 botis b , orbiting with a period of about 3.3 days , we have shown that most s conservative threshold for detection of a light variation is about 2.5 ppm , with binned data taken over 50 days . extingthis estimate includes realistic models of both stellar granulation noise and of most s noise environment . extingsuch a low limit means we have a good chance to measure the planet known phase angle and radius .   in addition the shape of the light curve will aid us in first determining a light curve signature to be used in detection of light curves from planets with non - edge - on inclinations , and in progressing towards a workable model of the atmosphere .   we are currently working on simulations of hd 209458b .    in modeling cegp light curves we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   in addition, we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   in addition, we have made several improvements and extensions upon previous work .   one significant point is that the angular size of the star is important for planets with semi - major axes @xmath79 0.1 au .  this affects the high - angular - resolution features of the light curve compared to using a point - source star ( see figure  [ fig : lc1 ] ) .   in addition , modeling the light curve with a star of finite angular size instead of a point source causes a reduction in amplitude of a highly backscattering - peaked light curve by approximately 20 percent ( as first noted in seager et al . ).   the other new , apj , 568 , 377 charbonneau , d. , brown , t. , latham , d. , & mayor , m. 2000 , apj , 529 , l45 charbonneau , d. , noyes , r. w. , korzennik , s. g. , nisenson , p. jha , s. , vogt , s. s. , & kibrick , r. i. 1999 , apj , 522 , l145 cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , & cho , j. y - k . , , p. 1 , p. 1 , p. 1 , p. 1 , p. 1 , p. 1 , p. 1 , pasp , pasp , pasp , 104 , 413 konacki , m. , torres , g. , jha , s. , & sasselov , d. 2003 , nature , 421 , 507 kurtz , d.w . 2003 , a&a 398 , 1117 kurtz , m. , dolez , n. and chevreton , m. 2003 . a&a&a 398 , 1117 kurucz , r. 1992 , in iau symp . pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , pasp , & a. renzini ( dorderecht : kluwer ) , 225 kuschnig , r. , matthews , j. , lanting , t. , & walker g. , 2003 , in preparation leigh , c. , collier cameron , a. , horne , k. , penny , a. , & d. j ney , c. , butler , p. , marcy , g. , jones , h. , penny , a. , mccarthy , c. , & carter , b. , 2002 , apj , 571 , 528 von zeipel , h. 1924 mnras , 84 , 665 walker , g.a.h . , matthews , j. , kuschnig , r. , johnson , r. , rucinski , s. , pazder , j. , and others , 2003 , pasp submitted submitted submitted , & carter , b. , & carter , b. , 2002 , apj , 571 , 528 von zeipel , h. 1924 mnras , 84 , 665 walker , g.a.h . , matthews , j. , kuschnig , r. , johnson , r. , rucinski , s. , pazder , j. , and others , 2003 , pasp submitted submitted submitted submitted submitted submitted submitted submitted , 2002 , pasp submitted submitted , 2002 , apj , 571 , 528 von zeipel , h. 1924 mnras , h. 1924 mnras",

( 2007 , 2008 ) ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we used semi - analytical models to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions of lbgs and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift . embodimentsthe first halo mass function in an analytical form was given by press & schechter ( 1974 ) . embodimentsthe press - schechter ( ps ) mass function has been widely employed in osity functions and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in paper  i and ii , we concluded that the observed redshift evolution of the luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath5 requires evolution in physical properties that govern the star formation activity on top of the evolution in the number density of dark matter halos coming from the structure formation model .    in paper  i and ii ,we found that the required amount of redshift evolution in the star formation activities depends on the redshift evolution of the number density of dark matter halos and hence on the assumed form of the halo mass function .    in paper  i and ii , we showed that galactic scale outflows originating predominantly from small mass halos with mass @xmath6 can pollute 60% of the igm with metals at @xmath7 with a metallicity floor of @xmath8 .    in paper  i and ii , we showed thatinclusion of star formation in even smaller mass halos which cool due to the presence of h@xmath9 or hd molecules , helps more in spreading the metals . to other mass functions ( ripamonti , 2007 and also see discussion in section  2 ) . an alternative is to simply take the derivative of the mass function under the assumption that it is sufficiently close to the net formation rate of objects in the mass range that is of interest to the semi - analytic models . embodimentsthis approach is widely used in several semi - analytical models in the literature ( for example haehnelt & rees 1993 , scannapieco 2005 ) . embodimentsthe derivative includes not only the formation rate of halos , but also their destruction rate at the same redshift . embodimentstherefore it is not guaranteed to be positive definite . embodimentsthis is the disadvantage of using the derivative of the mass function . embodimentsnevertheless , in the range of halo masses that we will be interested in at different redshifts , we will see that the derivative of the mass function is indeed positive definite . embodimentstherefore , for other mass functions consider in this work , we simply use its derivative to model the net formation rate of dark matter halos . embodimentstherefore it is not guaranteed to be positive definite . embodimentswe will also compare results obtained using the derivative as an alternative to the sasaki formalism for the ps mass function . embodimentsthe given redshift @xmath22 . embodimentsthe differential halo mass function is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average density of the universe at that redshift . embodimentsthe rms density fluctuations , @xmath25 , of the smooth density field with a top - hat window function is defined as @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the real - space top - hat filter , and @xmath30 is the growth factor of linear perturbations normalized to unity at @xmath28 ( peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 2002 ) . embodimentsthe idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq . suburthe idea of the halo mass function is that different analytical forms of the halo mass function can be represented with different forms of the function @xmath31 in that equation . embodimentsfor example , @xmath31 for the ps mass function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical over density for collapse , usually taken to be equal to @xmath34 . embodimentsthe simple form of ps mass function has been widely used in the semi eq . weap[ eqn_st ] then the st mass function reduces to the ps mass function . weap[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . weap[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . weap[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . weapfurther , jenkins et al . weap( 2001 ) found deviation from the st mass function in their simulations of the @xmath42cdm and @xmath43cdm cosmologies . weapthey proposed another @xmath31 which fits better their own simulations over more than four orders of magnitude in mass , @xmath44 to @xmath45 . weapthis mass function , referred to here as jenkins & white ( jw ) mass function is given by @xmath46}. \\label{eqn_jw}\\ ] ] another study of @xmath31 was made by reed et al.(2003 ) . weapthey used high -

analytical models are to the assumed form of the halo mass function .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we begin by comparing the net formation rate of dark matter halos for different halo mass functions described above .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this is the section 1 , we rather model the net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos , by taking the redshift derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath65 .        in fig . [ fig_rates ] we show the ratio of the redshift derivatives for different halo mass functions to that obtained for the ps mass function . in panels with @xmath66 we show three characteristics masses related to our star formation model at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]in addition with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows we show the masses corresponding to halos with circular velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . this is the mass range where radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background becomes important ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see in sec .  3 ) . [ fig_rates ]in this redshift range the process of reionization is believed to be already over ( fan et al . (2006 ) star formation for halos of mass above @xmath76 , attributed to the agn feedback ( see section  2 of paper  i ) . suburthis reduces the difference in the prediction of our semi - analytical modelling of star formation arising due to different halo mass functions at these redshifts . suburhence , for @xmath75 all the mass functions predict a halo formation rate within a factor 2 of each other , for typical masses which contribute to the star formation . suburthe abrupt cut - off seen in the formation rate at @xmath77 around @xmath78 is due to the fact the derivative of the ps mass function is becoming negative . suburthis shows the unphysical behavior in calculating the net formation rate by taking derivative of the mass function . however , star formation in such low mass halos ( @xmath79 ) at @xmath80 are suppressed by the radiative feedback ( see below ) . suburit is interesting to note that all the mass functions other than the ps mass function predict similar @xmath81 . suburthis clearly shows that semi - analytical models using different mass functions ( except the ps mass function ) , will all give similar results . suburit is a nontrivial exercise to demonstrate the difference between the formation , @xmath85 is the fraction of total baryonic mass that goes into stars in the entire lifetime of the halo and @xmath86 is a parameter which governs the duration of the star formation activity in the halo . as in papers i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .further , @xmath88 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath22 ; thus @xmath89 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath90 is the dynamical time at that epoch .furtherthe star formation rate is converted to luminosity at @xmath91     assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed [ see eq .  ( 6)-(8 ) of paper  i ] .furtherthe star formation rate is converted to luminosity at @xmath91      assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed [ see eq .  ( 6)-( i ) . the reionization history of the universe is required to self - consistently incorporate radiative feedback for each model . in table  [ tab_reion ]we compute it following again the method set out in paper  i ( section 2.4 ) . in table [ tab_reion ] we summarize the reionization history in terms of the electron scattering optical depth to the reionization ( @xmath102 ) and the redshift of reionization ( @xmath103 ) for some of our models .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction

photons escape into the igm .note that we have assumed only 10% of the created uv photons escape into the igm .note that not differ greatly amongst themselves . suburit is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model . suburthus to get the same @xmath102 we need a smaller efficiency ( or @xmath85 ) for models with st and other mass functions compared to models using the ps mass function . suburthis basically reflects the smaller abundance of rare high mass collapsed halos for the ps halo mass function at high @xmath22 . suburhowever for ` molecular cooled ' models , one needs to lower @xmath85 considerably in the molecular cooled objects , to be consistent with the observed value of @xmath102 for the st and other mass functions . suburthis can be seen in table  [ tab_reion ] , that to be consistent with the observed @xmath102 , one needs to adopt a value of @xmath108 for molecular cooled halos . suburalso note that @xmath103 is less in molecular cooled models though @xmath102 is higher . suburthis is because of radiative feedback : more uv photons are generated by the molecular cooled objects which increase the degree of ionization of the igm at see fig . subur[ fig_uv_lf ] ) . herewith the ps halo mass function, we do not make any attempt to fit the observed luminosity function . suburthis will be done in the latter part of this section . suburin our model we assume @xmath109 , @xmath110 with cosmological parameters mentioned in the introduction . suburwe apply a constant dust reddening correction of factor @xmath111 for all redshifts and masses . suburit is clear from this figure that at @xmath112 , the ps halo mass function ( solid lines ) predicts lower number of lbgs compared to any other mass functions in the observed luminosity range . suburthis is simply a manifestation of the fact that the ps mass function predicts less number of rare high mass halos compared to other mass functions . suburbut at the low mass end the ps mass function predicts a higher number density of collapsed objects . suburthis effect can be seen at @xmath113 where the uv luminosity function at @xmath114 is slightly higher for the models with ps mass function . suburthe difference between the ps mass function and other mass functions is mass dependent which leads to a different slope in the luminosity function calculated from different mass functions . . at @xmath115 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at

matching at the low luminosity end of the luminosity function ( see fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] ) and a very strong deviation at the high luminosity end for @xmath120 . extingthus the reasonable match in the luminosity function at @xmath113 and strong disagreement at high-@xmath22 could be attributed to the fact that as one moves to higher and higher the two methods first approach each other for @xmath132 , after which the derivative method starts to produce a larger luminosity function . nevertheless , since @xmath90 is much smaller than the hubble time , we find the differences between the luminosity function calculated by these two methods , are less than @xmath122 for all @xmath22 . extingthis difference is much smaller than the difference between luminosity functions , that are obtained using ps and other mass functions for @xmath133 . extingit is also clear from fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] that the shape of the uv luminosity functions ( the slope and characteristic luminosity ) and its redshift evolution , does depend on the assumed form of the halo mass function . extingthis is expected as we have seen in fig . extingit is also clear from fig . extingit is also clear from fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] that , in principle we would be able to constrain the form of the halo mass function , just by fitting the luminosity functions . in what follows we use @xmath0 minimization to address this issue . extingwe use @xmath0 minimization technique to quantify how well the models using different mass functions reproduce the care of this aspect by calculating the intrinsic luminosity at appropriate wavelengths .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the observed data and the best fit lf for the st ( solid line ) and ps ( dashed line ) mass functions are given fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the observed

several independent fields , the errors take into account the cosmic variance very well .is obtained using several independent fields , the errors take into account the cosmic variance very well . as can be seen from the table  [ tab_fit ] the model using the st mass function provides a good fit to the data ( with a reduced @xmath138 ) . whereas the reduced @xmath0 for the model using the ps mass function is high ( @xmath139 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this is mainly because the ps mass function overpredicts low luminosity objects and under predicts high luminosity objects xmath166 & @xmath167 & @xmath168 + @xmath169 & @xmath168 + @xmath169 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & @xmath172 & @xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 +   +   +   +   +   +   [ tab_fit ]    we now consider the luminosity functions for @xmath176 . suburthe observed luminosity function at this redshift covers a much wider luminosity range , thanks to the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) and goods ( the great observatories origins deep survey ) data . suburtabulated luminosity functions based on hudf and goods are available in beckwith et al . subur( 2006 ) and bouwens et al . suburwe use bouwens et al s data for our analysis . suburthey estimate rms due to cosmic variance to be @xmath177% . suburthis fractional uncertainty is added to the poisson error in quadrature ( as done in beckwith et al . subur2006 and bouwens et al 2009 ) . suburwe find that this is essential to get @xmath178 while fitting it is clear from table  [ tab_fit ] and fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf_fit ] that the observed lf at this redshift is not reproduced well either by models using st mass function or ps mass function . observed points in the lower luminosity end are systematically lower than model predictions . suburin particular the discontinuity seen at @xmath182 contribute appreciably to the @xmath0 . suburnote such a structure in lf , if true , can not be reproduced by our models . suburhowever , what is interesting is that for this redshift bin the model using the st mass function provides better fit to the data than the one that uses the ps mass function . suburthe observed luminosity function at @xmath183 are from bouwens et al . challeng( 2007 ) . a fractional uncertainty of @xmath184 ( bowens et al . challeng2007 ) is added to the poisson error in quadrature . suburmodels with both ps and st mass functions provide acceptable fits to the data , with the latter having better fit to the data than the one that uses the ps mass function . suburthe observed luminosity function at @xmath185 are from ( bouwens et al . challeng2009 ) the models with the st mass function provide a better fit to the observed data . suburat least for @xmath7 , where the lf is well defined in the high luminosity end , we find that even changing the agn feed back in model that uses ps mass function does not help in producing a @xmath0 better than that obtained for models with st mass function . suburwe now consider the best fit values of @xmath134 at different redshifts . suburcolumns  2 and 5 of table  [ tab_fit ] list the best fit values of @xmath134 obtained at the observed wavelength for which the luminosity function has been measured , for the models with the st and ps mass functions respectively . suburnote that in principle , the amount of dust reddening correction depends very much on the wavelength . extinghence , in order to compare the best fit values of @xmath134 at different redshifts we use the dust model like that applicable to the galaxy or large magellanic clouds @xcite , and bring all the @xmath134 values to the wavelength of @xmath91   . suburthese values are also tabulated in table  [ tab_fit ] ( in column  4 and 7 for the molecular cooled models . practitionhowever , the molecular cooled objects play an important role in setting up the metallicity floor in the igm at high redshift as shown in paper  ii . therefore, we will also consider the models with star formation in molecular cooled objects for galactic outflows . practitionwe turn now to models of galactic outflows and their feedback into the igm , an issue that was addressed in detail in paper ii . note that the metals detected in the igm can only have been synthesized by stars in galaxies , and galactic outflows are the primary means by which they can be transported from galaxies into the igm ( silk ,

velocity drops to the sound speed of the surrounding igm . embodimentsthe extent @xmath195 , to which an individual outflow can propagate into the igm , depends mainly on the rate of sne productions and the energy efficiency of the outflow , @xmath196 . in paper ii , we showed that @xmath195 is fairly independent of other parameters as long as the outflow escapes the halo potential . embodimentsnote that we have already constrained @xmath134 by fitting the uv luminosity functions of lbgs . embodimentshowever , we need some specific values of @xmath85 to calculate the effect of outflow . for the ps mass function, we take @xmath197 and for st and other mass functions @xmath198 for the whole @xmath22 range .    after calculating the evolution of a the porosity weighted averages of various physical quantities associated with the outflows , and their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in our models , we compute the metallicity of the outflowing gas and the global average metallicity assuming instantaneous metal mixing within the galaxy ( see appendix  a of paper  ii ) .          in fig . and in fig . [ fig_filling ] we show the filling factor of the universe as predicted by using different halo mass functions . in all these models ,the different models considered are : the st ( long dashed green ) , jw ( short dashed blue ) , warren ( dot dot dashed magenta ) and reed ( dotted dashed violet ) halo mass functions . in all these models we take @xmath207 . in all these models we take @xmath211 . in all these models we take @xmath210 . in all these models we take @xmath211 . in all these models we take @xmath212 . in all these models we take @xmath211 . in all these models we take @xmath210 . in all these models we take @xmath211 . in all these models we take @xmath207 . in assumes that the outflowing material no longer contributes to the volume filling factor .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\but in the models with the derivative of the ps mass function once an outflow is formed it contributes to the volume filling factor for ever ; although the derivative itself gives the net ( formation minus destruction ) rate , at @xmath60 . and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus leads to a smaller formation rate of halos at @xmath60 . the net difference between sasaki formalism and the derivative of the ps mass function is about a factor of @xmath60 , at @xmath216 , at @xmath214 , at @xmath217 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath113 , the net difference between sasaki formalism and the derivative of the ps mass function is about a factor of @xmath60 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\can be seen from fig . 神[ fig_sasaki_deriv ] .    in this figure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we show @xmath82 and @xmath215 as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath216 and @xmath214 halos , while fixing @xmath217 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\note that @xmath82 and @xmath215 come as a part of the integrand over @xmath60 unity . in this case,we find that the volume filling factor is the largest , even higher than that obtained when one uses the derivative of the mass function to calculate the halo formation rate .    we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] .    the volume filling factor that realistically obtains will be bracketed by these two cases ( the thick / thin solid lines of fig .  [ fig_filling ] ) .    the volume filling factor that realistically obtains will be bracketed by these two cases ( the thick / thin solid lines of fig .  [ fig_filling ] ) .    this difference also gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the volume filling factor obtained in semi - analytic models .    we see from fig  [ fig_rates ] that the net formation rates , calculated using the derivative of all the mass functions , agree reasonably well , for halos that contributes dominantly to @xmath208 .    this is the reason behind the close agreement behind @xmath208 estimated using the derivative of different mass functions .    next we compare various physical properties of outflows for different halo mass functions .    .    in panel ( b ) and ( c ) we show the por . in panel ( e ) and panel ( f ) we show thathence at @xmath212 average mass contributed to the volume filling factor is less in the models with the st mass function compared to that with the ps mass function . in panel ( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity weighted average radius of outflows whereas panel ( d ) compares the global average metallicity produced by star formation ( the top set of curves ) , and that which is injected into the igm ( the lower set of curves ) . due to the reason already mentioned above ,the average radius of the outflow and the metallicity show a similar behavior as the average halo mass for different models . in panel( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively . in panel( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively . in panel( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively . in panel( e ) and panel ( f )both the average peculiar velocity and the temperature for such distortions .the volume filling factor is much smaller when one employs the sasaki formalism and the sasaki formalism .however , this aspect needs to be studied further to see how much of a problem this is for the above models .    on the other hand, we also noted that molecular cooled models are better placed to seed the igm with metals without strong distorting effects on the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines . this is because outflows from molecular cooled halos can significantly fill the universe , even at @xmath226 , while at the same time having typically a much smaller radius .the volume filling factor is much smaller when one employs the sasaki formalism and the sasaki formalism .we therefore also consider here the effect of changing the halo mass function in such models .        in fig .[ fig_wind_m ] we show the volume filling factor predicted by the molecular cooled models , as obtained from the models with derivative of the ps ( dashed ) and st ( solid ) mass function .attributewe also show the @xmath227 when we use the sasaki formalism and the ps mass function ( dotted dashed line ) .attributewe take @xmath228 in the igm . suburin all these models one of the main ingredients is the halo mass function . suburwe used the standard ps mass function with the halo formation rate given by sasaki ( 1994 ) . however the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation , and the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation , and the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation , and the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation ,differ considerably from the ps mass function , especially for rare objects . suburit is then necessary to examine how this affects the model predictions given in paper i and ii . here, we present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass functions . suburfurther , two methods are normally used in the literature to compute the net formation rate of halos for the ps mass function ; ( i ) the formalism of sasaki is used to calculate a formation rate of halos at collapse and then fold in the halo survival probability to later epochs , or ( ii ) the derivative of the ps mass function is employed to get a net formation rate ( formation rate minus destruction rate ) at any redshift . we had st and other mass functions obtained from simulations compared to that with the ps mass function . suburthis decrease has to be much more in the small mass molecular cooled halos if they also contribute to the reionization process . * all new sets of data points , which extend the uv luminosity function of lbgs to the faint end and to higher @xmath22 ,suggestcan be naturally explained in the framework of our earlier models . * suburthe luminosity function determined using the ps and st mass functions match reasonably at @xmath113 , but they differ more and more strongly as one goes to higher redshifts , and especially at the bright end ( right panel of figure  [ fig_uv_lf ] ) . suburthis is because as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects and the ps mass function predicts a lower net formation rate compared to the st mass function or other mass functions derived from simulations . suburthe uv luminosity functions determined from all mass functions , other than the ps mass function , agree reasonably with each other . suburthis is because as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects and associated with outflows and the conclusions of paper ii appear to be largely insensitive to the adopted form of the halo mass function .    the next important step in the development of our models could be to implement it in the framework of a numerical simulation or by generating merger trees .    we hope thatthis will help in unambiguously determining the halo formation rate and its survival probability . 0548 bower , r. g. , benson , a. j. , malbon , r. , helly , j. c. , frenk , c. s. , baugh , c. m. , cole , s. , lacey , c. g. , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 645 bromm , v. , loeb a. , 2002 , apj , 575 , 111 cole , s. , aragon - salamanca , a. , frenk , c. s. , navarro , j. f. , navarro , j. f. , zepf , s. e. , 1994 , mnras , 271 , 781 chiu w.  a. , ostriker j.  p. , 2000 , apj , 534 , 507 dijkstra , m. , haiman , m. , haiman , z. , rees , m. , weinberg , d. h. , 2004 , apj , 601 , 666 dunkley , j. et al . , 2008 , arxiv:0803.0586 fan , x. , strauss , m. a. , h. m. p. , yoshida , n. , 2001 mnras , 321 , 372 kauffmann , g. , white , s. d. m. , guiderdoni , b. , 1993 , mnras , 264 , 201 madau , p. , ferrara , a. , rees , m. , 2001 , apj , 555 , 92 mannucci , f. , buttery , h. , maiolino , r. , marconi , a. & pozzetti , l. 2007 , a&a , 461 , 423 miralda - escude , j. , rees , m. j. , 1997 , apj , 478 , 57 nagamine k. , ostriker , j. p. , fukugita , m. , cen , r. , 2006 , astro - ph/0603257 nath , b. b. , & trentham , n. , mnras , 291 , 505 oesch , p.  a. , et al . , 2006 , apj , 671 , 1212 oppenheimer , b. d. , dave , r. , 2006 . , erb , d. k. , adelberger , k. l. , 2006 , apj , 644 , 792 reddy , n. a. , steidel , c. c. , 2008 , arxiv:0810.2788 ripamonti , e. , 2007 , mnras , 376 , 709 . 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , 2007 , mnras , 377 , 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , 2007 , mnras , 377 , 285 samui , s. , subramanian , k. , srianand , r. , 2008 , mnras , 385 , 783 s. , 1994 , pasj , 46 , 427 sawicki , m. , & thompson , d. , 2006 , apj , 642 , 653 scannapieco , e. , 2005 , apj , 624 , l1 sheth r. k. , tormen g. , 1999 , mnras , 308 , 119 ( st ) silk , j. , wyse ,",

      "generated": "recent years , the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy has been extensively investigated within the framework of transport theories , such as the nordheim approach , in which the vlasov equation for the one - body phase space density , @xmath1 , is supplemented with a pauli - blocked boltzmann collision term @xcite .the basic ingredients that enter the resulting transport equation , often called boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation , are the self - consistent mean - field potential and the two - body scattering cross sections .these transport models hence describe the time evolution of the reduced one - body density in phase - space and , consequently , they are suited for the description of one - body observables , such as inclusive particle spectra in nuclear collisions , average collective flows and excitations . however , they can not provide a reliable description of fluctuation phenomena , such as multi - fragmentation processes , i.e. the break - up of excited nuclear systems into many pieces .in fact , neither fluctuations of one - body observables nor many - body correlations can be addressed with this class of mean - field models . hence suitable extensions , including fluctuations of the one - body density , have to be considered .in fact shape , the method would become identical to standard mean - field descriptions . embodimentswhile the wave function localization appears appropriate to describe final fragmentation channels , where each single particle wave function should be localized within a fragment , the use of fixed shape localized wave packets in the full dynamics could affect the correct description of one - body effects , such as spinodal instabilities and zero sound propagation @xcite . embodimentson the other side , in the so - called stochastic mean - field approaches , the stochastic extension of the transport treatment for the one - particle density is obtained by introducing a stochastic term representing the fluctuating part of the collision integral @xcite , in close analogy with the langevin equation for a brownian motion . embodimentsthis can be derived as the next -

fragmentation mechanism , that is dominated by spacial density fluctuations , a more accurate representation of the full phase space dynamics , including fluctuations , would allow to improve the description of the fragment kinematical properties and correlations . embodimentswe also stress the general interest of this effort . embodimentsindeed transport phenomena occur in many physical systems , for which a more precise description of the time evolution of the one - body distribution function , including the effect of many - body correlations , would be important . embodimentsa first attempt to introduce a fluctuating collision term in a 3d transport approach was made by bauer et al . embodimentsthis method can be implemented relatively easily into standard transport codes that adopt the scattering of pseudo - particles ( or test particles ) as a method of attention to the definition of the phase - space metric that would optimize the value of this variance .sectionthe paper is organized as follows : we will first recall the main ingredients of the bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthe bl theory , in order to connect the formalism with the numerical implementation adopted ( section 2 ) .sectionthethen we will discuss in more detail the methods that have been proposed so far to solve the boltzmann -

classical framework , the stochastic transport equation of motion for the one - body distribution function @xmath2 can be expressed in the following form , @xmath6,f\\}\\   = \\ \\bar{k}[ - langevin treatment includes also the _ [part of the collision term , @xmath9$]@xcite .    in the simple physical scenario where the residual interaction can be considered as binary collisions that are well localized in space and time ,the correlation function for the fluctuating part of the collision term is given by @xmath10 and @xmath10 ( @xmath10 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a short - hand notation for @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the associated fermi blocking factor . The correlation function for the fluctuating part of the collision term is given by @xmath14 and @xmath14 is the degeneracy factor . the basic transition rate is simply related to the differential cross section for the corresponding two - body scattering process , @xmath15 being @xmath16 the relative velocity , and it thus has corresponding symmetry properties , @xmath17    since it arises from the same elementary two - body processes , the stochastic part of the collision term is fully determined by the basic transition rate as well , as a manifestation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . with respect to the binary collisions assumed to be local in space and time , the bl equation on a lattice ; phase space is therefore divided into a number of cells , each one having volume @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes a point in phase space : @xmath29 ) .the bl equation on a lattice ; phase space is therefore divided into a number of cells , each one having volume @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes a point in phase space : @xmath29 ) .the bl equation on a lattice ;each transition involves four locations , and the collision integral arises from the sum of the transitions evaluated for all possible combinations of the cells : from this consideration one recognizes that the practicality of the method is limited by the huge computational effort required .in fact , only two - dimensional implementations exist @xcite .in fact , only two - dimensional implementations exist @xcite .the bl equation on a lattice ;each transition represents a basic stochastic process , and , following the bl theory , the actual number of such transitions in a time step @xmath30 is dispersed around the mean value according to a poisson distribution , so its variance amounts to : @xmath31 where the average is given by : @xmath32 @xmath33[ni_med ] + this the early fluctuations developed in momentum space are subsequently transmitted into density fluctuations and amplified by the nuclear mean field @xcite , leading to large instabilities and a statistical population of fragments .      the method of ref.@xcite was originally developed as a way to overcome the problems arising from the solution of transport equations with the test particle method , which we now discuss briefly . within the test particle method , each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . on the one side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side ,the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically divided by @xmath42 . on the other side ,the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically math42 . practition2 .   then two test particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 are chosen as colliding partners , and will be moved from their positions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , to new positions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , according to the corresponding transition probability including the pauli blocking of the final states @xcite . practitionif the two particles can collide , the scattering actually involves two `` clouds '' of neighbouring test particles , corresponding to two entire nucleons ( @xmath50 particles ) . practitionthe contiguity criterion is based on the following definition of phase - space distance : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fermi momentum and @xmath53 is the radius of the considered system . practition( it should be noticed that the choice of this phase - space metric is rather arbitrary ) . practitionthe final states are adjusted using the average momenta of the two clouds as initial states . practitionthe final states are adjusted using the average momenta of the two clouds as initial states . practitiontwo important remarks have to be done :    * the pauli blocking is checked only for the collision of the test particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the fact that pauli blocking is checked only for the first two colliding partners , and the system progressively evolves towards an equilibrium configuration which is more consistent with the one of a classical system . from this discussion it is evident that a proper treatment of the pauli blocking is a fundamental requirement for any numerical implementation of the boltzmann - langevin theory for fermionic systems . however , apart from these problems , the pseudo - particle correlation method represents a simple and practical way to implement fluctuations into transport codes .the method is not very accurate for fermionic systems .therefore , it is worthwhile to think about some improvements to make it more accurate .this is the aim of the present work , as we will discuss in the next section .the method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems .this is the aim of the present work , as we will discuss in the next section .the method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems .the new procedure can be summarized in the following steps : this choice corresponds to the maximum of possible moves . nomine4 .   surrounding momentum space cells are searched with the same prescriptions , until two entire nucleons are found . nominethe search procedure is symmetric with respect to the center of momentum of the two partners and random in the vicinity of the original cells ( i , j ) . nominefinally , the two clouds are moved to the new states of the rotated frame ( see fig.2 ) , so that the conservation of energy and momentum is automatically obtained . nominehowever , a further check is performed . nominein fact , due to the finite number of test particles , the one - body density is not perfectly homogeneous inside each cell . nominethis causes slight violations of the conservations laws . nominehence the origin of the momentum space grid is eventually slightly displaced in order to have a perfect energy and momentum conservation . nominethis method involves two parameters , namely the radius of the sphere in @xmath69 space , @xmath59 , and the size of the momentum cells , @xmath60 . nominethe radius @xmath59 fixes the spatial extension of the nucleon , that in turn influences its spreading in momentum space . nominehence the origin of the momentum space grid is eventually slightly displaced in a connection between the proposed method and the lattice simulation method to build fluctuations .    the numerical procedure described in ref . practition@xcite , where the phase space is discretized by a fixed grid of cells , allows to construct the correct value of the fluctuation amplitude in each cell of the grid , generally taken of volume @xmath40 ( but in principle it can be even smaller ) , on the basis of the fluctuating gain and loss terms . on the other hand , the contour procedure is based on a different philosophy : instead of constructing fluctuations in fixed cells , when a collision occurs we move all together the phase space volume containing one nucleon . in other words ,the shape of this volume is not fixed a priori and depends on the location of the four points ( @xmath70 ) that have been chosen as initial and final centroids of the considered two - body collision . in other words , the contour procedure is based on a different philosophy : the `` correlation volume '' , i.e. the volume of the sphere that envelops all test particles that move all together in each collision , is not fixed , but has to be considered as a dynamical variable that generally exceeds @xmath40 and could even reach rather on wave packet .    in both numerical implementations described above , two - body collisions among nucleons are treated as a stochastic process .are treated as a stochastic process . only the definition of nucleon wave packet and/or of the elementary cells where fluctuations are built change from one method to the other . as discussed above, this ingredient is not contained in the bl equation and such information is beyond its derivation . in any case,hence , both procedures can be considered as correct implementations of the boltzmann - langevin theory in the `` continuum limit '' , the definition of `` nucleon wave packet '' being rather arbitrary . in any case, it is also very interesting to investigate the differences between the various possible methods used to build the nucleon clouds , that in turn influence the correlation volume .in particular , one can also try to force the procedure in order to reduce the wave packet smearing and to correlate particles inside smaller volumes ( close to @xmath40 ) .      in the present first implementation of the method , we neglect the evolution in coordinate space , extending @xmath59 to the whole coordinate space .in particular , we neglect the evolution in coordinate space , extending @xmath59 to the whole for simplicity , we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the total extension in momentum space of the system is @xmath81 . embodimentsthen the system is divided into @xmath82 smaller cells that can contain at most half nucleon , whose occupancy can be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . hence @xmath85 . the occupancy is randomly chosen at the beginning and collisions are performed until equilibrium has been reached . embodimentsthe initial ( @xmath86,@xmath87 ) and final ( @xmath88,@xmath89 ) states of a collision are chosen randomly among the @xmath90 cells . embodimentswe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple example . embodimentsmoreover , for simplicity , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and , in this case , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively. hence only half of the considered space is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision to happen is proportional to the product @xmath93 . according to eq . isEnabled( [ scaling ] ) , the expected fluct ( of volume @xmath98 ) that are contained inside the volume @xmath76 where the function @xmath2 is evaluated . the fluctuation value presented in the figure below is multiplied by @xmath97 .the fluctuation value presented in the figure belowis multiplied by @xmath97 .the fluctuation value presented in the figure belowis multiplied by @xmath97 .as one can see in the figure , the correct value of the fluctuations , i.e. @xmath99 , is approximately recovered ( within @xmath100 ) for volumes @xmath101 .the slight deviation is due to the upper bound considered for the `` correlation radius '' and to the constraints imposed by the total mass conservation , that are also responsible for the decrease of fluctuations observed for large @xmath97 values . from this simple example, it already appears that the exact fluctuation value @xmath102 is reached only asymptotically .the fluctuation value is reached only asymptotically .the fluctuation value is reached only asymptotically .the fluctuation value is reached only asymptotically .the fluctuation value is reached only asymptotically .this is due to the arbitrariness of the nucle velocity @xmath105 is constant , since only particles with opposite momenta can collide , in order to stay on the fermi surface . undenso the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath106 . undenso the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath106 . undenthis simplified system will allow us to study the sensitivity of the results to the ingredients of the procedure used to build , step by step , the nucleon clouds . undenas also discussed before , we will show that the correct fluctuation amplitude is recovered in the `` continuum limit '' , i.e. in large volumes . undenhowever , in the following we will mostly concentrate on the fluctuation amplitude in volumes of size @xmath98 , in order to probe the extension of the nucleon wave packet . undenthe latter could influence significantly the evolution of actual nuclear collisions , where it could be important to work with more compact nucleon configurations .    using this simple model , we will find that building the maximum fluctuation value ( e.g. @xmath107 ) in such a volume , i.e. correlating particles inside @xmath103 , is a quite difficult task and additional efforts are required in order to reduce the nucleon cloud , whose size is chosen to accommodate one nucleon at most , so that @xmath117 .attributewe have checked that the results do not depend on the number of cells , i.e. the number of nucleons considered , by performing the same calculations on a @xmath118 system .attributewe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon .attributewe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon .attributethe growth of fluctuations is described by the variance @xmath77 of the distribution function , as discussed before .attributeusually it is evaluated performing an ensemble average over a large number of events having the same initialization . however , in this scheme the mean value @xmath120 does not depend on the position @xmath5 and is not changing in time . considering the large number of cells employed , we can also follow the evolution of the system by calculating in a single event the following quantity : @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the average with respect to the cells and @xmath123 .       in order to understand how the recognition of the nucleon wave packet can be influenced by the details of our procedure ,attributewe first further simplify the problem by using a single fixed grid to make the collisions , fixed grid , with increasing number of collisions ( i.e. as a function of time ) . practitionit saturates approximately when almost all nucleons have suffered one collision . in the equilibrium configuration , the fluctuations reached in @xmath103 also depend on the variance of the initial configuration . practitionthe number of cells with the three possible values of @xmath2 is roughly the same , as shown in fig . practition[ full_esa ] ( lower panel ) , so the fluctuation variance is @xmath129 , which is about @xmath130 of the maximum .    , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases : fixed grid with @xmath131 ( dot - dashed ) , fixed grid with randomly distributed test particles ( full ) , moving grid ( dashed ) . practitionlower panel : distribution of the number of cells as a function of their occupation @xmath2 at equilibrium , for the three cases indicated above . ]    , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases : fixed grid with @xmath131 ( dot - dashed ) , fixed grid with randomly distributed test particles ( full ) , moving grid ( dashed ) . practitionlower panel : distribution of the number of cells as a two reference frames used to make the collision ( the one concerning the initial states and the one for the final states ) are now shifted along the @xmath115 axis , since the angle @xmath115 of the initial and final states can assume any value between @xmath83 and @xmath136 , according to the initial and final positions of the colliding test particles , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . embodimentsthis carries two important consequences . embodimentsfirst of all , even being the pauli blocking checked for each collision in a particular frame , the prescription @xmath137 can be violated in another frame . embodimentshowever , we checked that this violation concerns only about @xmath138 of the cells . embodimentssecond , the correlation between the cells representing the reconstructed nucleon , which is maximum in the search frame , will be systematically broken in another ( shifted ) reference frame , increasing the nucleon delocalization and thus reducing fluctuations in @xmath103 . embodimentsthe dashed curve in fig . [ full_esa ] shows the fluctuations obtained in @xmath103 in this case . since embodimentshowever , we checked that this feature is due to the arbitrary position of the centroid of the constructed nucleon with respect to a fixed reference frame @xmath103 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . 神[ smallphi_full ] ) . 神, also shown in fig . 神[ full_esa ] . ] 神the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure . 神the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath145 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure . 神moreover , it further reduces for @xmath145 . 神nevertheless , this smearing effect is partly compensated by the fact that the procedure used to select the cells belonging to the nucleon clouds favours compact , symmetric configurations . 神it is interesting to evaluate the effect of the use of a small search cell on the fluctuations also in the general case , i.e. when the fixed grid condition is relaxed . 神intuitively , we expect a small effect on the variance , as long as @xmath146 is not too small : the main reduction of fluctuations comes already from the _ centroid effect _ 神( see previous subsection ) , which is equivalent to an infinitely small step . 神in fact , the differences between calculations with @xmath85 and @ is recovered in large volumes . 神this last point has been checked for all the simplified situations considered here ( fermi surface ) . 神for instance , this analysis is shown in fig.[fluct_new ] in the case of the fixed grid with @xmath140 and test particles randomly distributed inside the system ( last case of section 5.2 ) .    ) as a function of the number @xmath97 of nucleon cells @xmath103 , obtained in the fixed grid case with @xmath147 and test particles randomly distributed . ]    here fluctuations are evaluated in volumes @xmath76 , by considering an ensemble of 800 events . 神as expected , the fluctuation variance , rescaled by @xmath97 , almost approaches the expected value as the volume @xmath76 increases . as explained above for the idealized case presented in fig.3 , the fluctuation variance , rescaled by @xmath97 , almost approaches the expected value as the volume @xmath76 increases . as explained above for the idealized case presented in fig.3 ,the maximum value , @xmath99 , is not exactly reached because of the upper bound imposed to the correlation radius in the nucleon reconstruction procedure and of mass conservation 150 . ] suburwe get a confirmation of these findings by removing the fixed grid constraint . suburalso in this case , at the end we find no difference with the case described before ( initialization with randomly distributed test particles , section 5.3 ) , see fig . subur[ f1_rand ] . suburmoreover , in this case the convergence between the two calculations is rather quick . suburthen we can conclude that the final outcome does not depend on the initial conditions of the system , but only on the final equilibrium situation , as it should be . suburbut for @xmath147 and without the fixed grid constraint . ] suburguided by the simplified schematic cases illustrated above , let us now discuss the full case of a nuclear fermi gas of particles at a given temperature and density interacting through hard two - body scattering . as in the previous examples , since we focus on fluctuations in momentum space , only one large cubic cell is present in coordinate space , and all particles can be chosen to collide ( no restrictions in @xmath69 space ) . suburthe size of the box is @xmath152 , and we consider @xmath153 nucleons , so that the density has the saturation value @xmath154 ; each nucleon is represented by a collection of changes are observed , probably due to the finite extension of the nucleon packet , that induces a discretization of the phase space . in the following section ,we investigated the region in @xmath5 space , at the time @xmath162( solid ) and at the time @xmath161 ( dashed line ) . ]   we also compared the average collision rate with analytical expectations : we find that the number of collisions is slightly larger than the analytical one , but differences are within @xmath162 ; on the other hand , similar deviations are also found in usual buu implementations , due to the approximate mapping of phase space induced by the finite number of test particles . in the following section ,we analyze in more detail the capability of the procedure to build the fluctuations in the considered 3d scenario . in the following section ,we investigated the region in @xmath5 space where collisions are most probable and the extension of the nucleon cloud . from the left panel of fig .10 , right ) and from the right panel of fig .10 ,[ polar ] it is evident that most collisions involve nucleons lying on the surface of the fermi sphere , as expected .besides , the right panel illustrates the extension of the clouds in the radial xmath103 are considerably underestimated , as shown in fig.[flu_vp ] , where the variance @xmath77 is reported as a function of the energy @xmath173 .    , in cubic cells of size @xmath103 , for a fermi gas at equilibrium . ]    in the following , to test our procedure , we will evaluate fluctuations considering big volumes , that contain many nucleons .    , in cubic cells of size @xmath103 , for a fermi gas at equilibrium .    , in cubic cells of size @xmath103 , for a fermi gas at equilibrium .    in the following , to test our procedure , we will evaluate fluctuations considering big volumes , that contain many nucleons .    , in the geometry considered , it should be noticed that , in the geometry considered , it is not trivial to predict which is the size and shape of the most appropriate volume to recover the expected value of fluctuations . while , from one side , it is desirable to consider volumes containing a large number of nucleons , from the other side one should keep in mind that spurious fluctuation reduction , due to the conservation of the total number of particles , may be a problem . 79 . suburnow we can observe that , increasing the angular spread , the variance first increases , then decreases again , due to the mass conservation constraints . suburthe variance gets larger when considering the angular spread @xmath184 , but the expected value is still underestimated by about a factor @xmath185 , at the peak . suburthis result can be understood on the basis of the results obtained in @xmath103 and displayed in fig.[flu_vp ] . suburin fact , in order to recover the expected fluctuation value , the volume employed for the calculation of the variance must be much larger than @xmath186 in all the directions @xmath187 . due to the considered geometry , while this can be easily obtained along the @xmath188 direction without losing locality for the value of @xmath2 and related fluctuations . suburactually , in the case of @xmath189 , the corresponding extension along the @xmath188 direction , @xmath190 , of the volume considered to evaluate the function @xmath2 is approximately equal to @xmath191 at @xmath192 . due to the considered geometry , while this can be achieved in the angular coordinates , this can not be easily obtained along the @xmath188 direction without losing locality for . by approximating the volume dependence of the rescaled variance by a linear behaviour for small volumes ( see fig.[flu_joseph ] for instance ) , the fluctuation variance presented in figs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\12 - 13 can be rewritten as : @xmath202 we notice that @xmath190 is also depending on @xmath180 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the fluctuation variance presented in figs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the fluctuation variance presented in figs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the fluctuation variance presented in figs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\12 -

space may affect the transport dynamics and it may be important to correlate the test particles belonging to the nucleon clouds inside smaller volumes . in the context of the simplified model ( fermi surface ) discussed in sect.5 we attempted to find a method to reduce the nucleon cloud smearing and enhance the fluctuations in @xmath103 without losing the consistency of the original procedure _esa ] is also shown for comparison ( solid line ) . as the dashed curve in fig . subur[ opt_full_esa ] clearly shows , this optimization procedure is successful in enhancing the fluctuations , which eventually reach almost their upper limit @xmath107 . suburactually , this maximum value is not obtained due to the fact that only adjacent cells are considered in the nucleon construction . in this way, some half - filled cells remain `` isolated '' and are not involved in a collision anymore . indeed , at the time when we stop the calculation , isolated cells amount to about @xmath138 of the total . suburthe method works also in more general situations , for instance in the case corresponding to fluctuating initial conditions ( see sect.5.2 ) . subur, as a function of the number of collisions , in the fixed grid scheme with fluctuating initial conditions . subursolid line : no optimization ; dashed line : optimized procedure . subur[ opt_full_rand ]    the comparison between variances with and without the optimization procedure is shown in fig . subur[ opt_full_rand ] . as in the previous case , suburthe optimization favours a faster growth of the fluctuations . suburtheir saturation value for @xmath224 is now enhanced one nucleon each , as proposed in ref.@xcite . however , while in the original procedure the pauli blocking was checked only for the centroids of the nucleon clouds , here we propose a new method that allows to construct nucleon wave packets by carefully checking the pauli blocking for the entire swarm of test particles . extingthe last point is essential in the construction of the correct fluctuation value in fermionic systems . extingthe nucleon wave packet may take , in principle , any shape . extingthus the correlation volume , i.e. the volume of the sphere that contains all test particles that move together is generally larger than @xmath226 . extingmoreover , the nucleon centroid is chosen randomly among the test particle distribution , leading to a partial overlap of nucleon configurations from one collision to another . extingall these effects lead to a reduction of fluctuations in the cells of volume @xmath226 . extinghowever , the correct fluctuation value is recovered in larger volumes , where all possible nucleon configurations may be accommodated . extingthe procedure , and its numerical ingredients , has been tested carefully in several idealized situations , studying in particular the relation between the results obtained for the fluctuations in cells of volume @xmath az and f.gulminelli , nucl . nutritive* a647 * ( 1999 ) 153 ; f.gulminelli , ph.chomaz , al.h.raduta , ad.r.raduta , phys.rev.lett . * b647 * ( 1999 ) 153 ; f.gulminelli , nucl . nutritive* a647 * ( 1999 ) 153 ; f.gulminelli , ph.chomaz , ad.r.raduta , phys.rev.lett . * b647 * ( 1999 ) 153 ; f.gulminelli , ph.chomaz , al.h.raduta , ad.r.raduta , phys .rev.lett . * b647 * ( 1999 ) 148 j.aichelin , nucl . nutritive* 202 * ( 1991 ) 233 h.feldmeier , nucl.phys . * carbohyda515 * ( 1990 ) 147 a.ono , h.horiuchi , t.maruyama and a.ohnishi , phys . nutritive* 68 * ( 1992 ) 2898 ; a.ono , h.horiuchi , t.maruyama and a.ohnishi , prog w.bauer , g.f.bertsch , and s.das gupta , phys . nutritive* 58 * ( 1987 ) 58 , proc . warrr.  soc . , phys . nutritivelondon * a119 * ( 1928 ) 689 , phys.rev . nutritive* 43 * ( 1933 ) 552 w.  bauer , g.f .bertsch , and h.  schultz , phys.rev.lett . * nutritive* 69 * ( 1992 ) 1888 b.  borderie , b.  remaud , m.f . brivet and f.  sebille , phys.lett . * b302 * ( 1993 ) 15    b. a. li and w. bauer , phys . lett . * b254 * ( 1991 ) 335 ; phys . nutritivelondon* c44 * ( 1991 ) 450 f. chapelle , g.f . warrburgio , ph . chomaz , and j. randrup , nucl . phys . * carbohyda540 * ( 1992 ) 227 g.f . warrburgio , ph . chomaz , and j. randrup , phys . nutritivelondon *",

field and/or deep surveys of galaxies , clusters and quasars are planned and operating at various wavelengths .the purpose of such cosmological surveys is two - fold ; to understand the nature of the astronomical objects themselves , and to extract the cosmological information . from the latter point of view , which we will pursue throughout this paper ,the objects serve merely as tracers of dark matter in the universe .the objects serve merely as tracers of dark matter in the universe .the objects serve merely as tracers of dark matter in the universe .since such _ luminous _ objects should have been formed as a consequence of complicated astrophysical processes in addition to the purely gravitational interaction , it is quite unlikely that they faithfully trace either the spatial distribution of dark matter or its redshift evolution .the objects serve merely as tracers of dark matter in the universe .rather it is natural to assume that they sample the dark matter distribution in a developed in a seminal paper by dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) , which inspired numerous recent activities in this field ( e.g. , pen 1998 ; taruya , koyama & soda 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; koyama & soda 1999 ; matsubara 1999 ; taruya 2000 ; somerville et al . 2000 ; taruya et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; koyama & soda 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al . 1999 ; blanton et al thus one can compute the various biasing parameters in an arbitrary cosmological model at a given redshift and a smoothing length in a straightforward fashion . embodimentswe derive the joint probability function assuming the primordial random - gaussianity of the dark matter density field , and thus the results are sufficiently general . embodimentswe note here , however , that our primary purpose is to present a general formulation to predict biasing properties of halos , and not to make detailed predictions at this point . embodimentsin fact we adopt a few approximations with limited validity in presenting specific examples , but this is not essential in our paper and the resulting predictions can be improved in a straightforward manner if other analytical / numerical approximations become available . embodimentsnevertheless we would like to emphasize that our simple analytical prescription largely explains the basic features of the biasing parameters reported in the previous numerical simulations ( kravtsov & klypin 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 ; somerville et al . 1999 we evaluate these quantities smoothed with a spherical symmetric filter function @xmath16 : @xmath17 which corresponds to quantities in equation ( [ eq : dgdm ] ) .    in general , we evaluate these quantities smoothed with a spherical symmetric filter function @xmath16 : @xmath17 which corresponds to quantities in equation ( [ eq : dgdm ] ) .    in general ,the one - point statistics of galaxies and the mass are calculated from equation ( [ eq : smoothed - delta ] ) .    in general , fluctuations of the biased objects , @xmath10 , @xmath9 are specified by multi - variate functions of @xmath10 and other observable and unobservable variables , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , characterizing the sample of objects .    in general ,then one can formally write @xmath20 where we use @xmath21 to denote the galaxy number density contrast at a position @xmath3 and redshift @xmath2 smoothed over a scale @xmath4 as a function of @xmath10 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . in the above expression , @xmath19 and xmath19 . to be more specific ,the statistical information of galaxy biasing is obtained by averaging over the joint pdf @xmath24 . to be more specific ,the statistical information of galaxy biasing is obtained by averaging over the joint pdf @xmath24 . to be more specific ,the statistical information of galaxy biasing is obtained by averaging over the joint pdf @xmath24 . to be more specific ,the joint average of a function @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 where we use @xmath27 so as to explicitly denote the joint average over the two stochastic variables , @xmath10 and @xmath9 .    in our prescription , however , it is more convenient to perform the averaging over @xmath28 instead of @xmath24 : @xmath29 where the variable @xmath21 in the argument of @xmath30 should be regarded as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath18 ( eq.[[delta -

hat _ shape of the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) .the mass density contrast @xmath2 smoothed over the top - hat _ shape of the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) .the mass density contrast @xmath10 computed in the eulerian coordinate relates @xmath4 with its lagrangian coordinate counterpart @xmath63 assuming the spherical collapse .the mass in the sphere @xmath64 is simply given by @xmath65 ,then the mass in the sphere @xmath64 is simply given by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the physical mass density at @xmath2 .also the linearly extrapolated mass density contrast @xmath67 in the sphere can be evaluated from @xmath10 on the basis of the nonlinear spherical collapse model ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) .the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) .each sphere of the eulerian radius @xmath4 should contain a number of gravitationally virialized objects i.e. , _ dark matter halos_. given @x chastic behavior in the resultant halo biasing .      in what follows ,we assume that the primordial mass density field obeys the random - gaussian statistics ( e.g. , bardeen et al . 1986 ; bardeen et al . 1986 ) . in this case , the ( unconditional ) mass function of dark halos ( press & schechter 1974 ) : @xmath71 } \\left|\\frac{d\\sigma^2(m_{1},z)}{dm_{1}}\\right|dm_{1}\\ ] ] proves to be in reasonable agreement with results from @xmath72-body simulations ( e.g. , efstathiou et al . 1988 ; suto 1993 ; lacey & cole 1993,1994 ) . equation ( [ universalmf ] ) corresponds to the comoving number density of halos exceeding the critical density threshold @xmath69 and of mass between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .the value for @xmath75 will be specified when we consider the one -

Additionally, one may numerically compute the conditional pdf @xmath14 , and the joint pdf @xmath137 from equation ( [ eq : jointpdf ] ) . embodimentsthen all the statistical quantities can be evaluated using equation ( [ ensemble - average2 ] ) . in practice , however , it is more convenient and even accurate to use ( [ ensemble - average ] ) which in the present case is written explicitly as @xmath138 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the above expression in evaluating the various biasing parameters below except in presenting the pdfs directly . embodimentswe present several specific predictions applying our nonlinear stochastic halo biasing model to representative cdm models mentioned in  [ subsec : formation epoch ] . throughout the analyses , we consider the range of halo mass between @xmath139 and @xmath140 unless otherwise stated . embodimentsthe general formulation described in the previous section should work in principle even on fully nonlinear scales . in practice , however , the plotted in figure [ fig : prob_dh ] for a given mass density contrast ; @xmath148 ( solid ) , @xmath149 ( dotted ) , @xmath150 ( dashed ) and @xmath151 ( dot - dashed ) . suburthe upper and lowers panels show the results at @xmath78 and @xmath152 , respectively , with the top - hat smoothing radius of @xmath153mpc ( _ left _ ) and @xmath154mpc ( _ right _ ) . suburthe ticks on the upper axis in each panel indicate the corresponding conditional mean @xmath155 ( eq.[[eq : conditional_mean ] ] ) . suburthe peak position of the distribution is in reasonable agreement with @xmath155 . suburas figure [ fig : dhdm ] indicates , @xmath97 given @xmath2 and @xmath4 is fairly monotonically dependent on @xmath98 and @xmath35 . suburthus the peak in the conditional pdf reflects that of the formation epoch distribution @xmath156 . suburthe width of the distribution around the peak , on the other hand , is dominated by the mass distribution since @xmath97 becomes more sensitive to the halo mass in a dens at moderately dense environment . practitionfor both reasons , the mean bias @xmath155 as a function of @xmath10 decreases at lower redshifts .    at @xmath78 , the joint pdf @xmath156 decreases at lower redshifts .    at @xmath78 , the joint pdf @xmath161 shows slightly anti - biasing behavior , i.e , @xmath162 . practitionthis is partly due to the fact that a fraction of halos with @xmath163 are merged into a part of larger mass halos since the typical virialized halo mass @xmath164 at @xmath78 approaches the mass scale @xmath165 , corresponding to our adopted smoothing radius @xmath153mpc itself . in other words , this is a natural consequence of our bias model in which the contour halo model generally predicts the positive - biasing except for those halos of @xmath166 for given @xmath4 and @xmath2 .    while figure [ fig : dhdm_lincont ] elucidates the global feature of the joint pdf , i.e.the statistical weights are practically dominated by the relatively narrow regions around @xmath167 m ] . suburincidentally this feature may be visually exaggerated by the contours of very small probabilities ; if one focuses only on the contours of @xmath173 , the effect does not look so strong . in reality , and thus in numerical simulations , additional stochastic processes other than the mass and formation epoch distribution ( including the dynamical motion of halos ) should further increase the scatter which makes the contour rounder than our predictions . suburwe will return to these contour plots in understanding the behavior of the biasing parameters later . suburthe previous two subsections show that the joint and the conditional pdfs are dependent on both @xmath4 and @xmath2 . suburthis dependence is translated to the scale - dependence and redshift evolution of the second order statistics defined in  [ subsec : second - order ] . suburfigure [ fig : sigma_hh ] shows @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath128 at different redshifts as a function @xmath4 . we compute those statistics directly integrating equation ( [ average ] ) over @xmath98 , @xmath35 and @xmath10 , instead of using @xmath161 . suburwhile their scale- and time - dependence is noticeable above feature should be ascribed to the stochasticity due to the distribution of @xmath98 and @xmath35 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\in fact , this stochasticity on large scales is expressed explicitly in terms of the linear biasing approximation by mo & white ( 1996 ) : @xmath180 with @xmath181 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it should be noted that @xmath182 is often regarded as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath98 assuming @xmath183 , leading to the linear _ deterministic _ model .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus once a halo mass @xmath98 is specified , @xmath35 is specified , @xmath55 . in equation ( [ eq : mwbias ] ) , however , we explicitly keep the @xmath35-dependence which adds the stochastic nature in the model .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\more specifically , the definition ( [ eq : scatt ] ) with equations ( [ average ] ) and ( [ eq : mwbias ] ) reduces to @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the average over @xmath98 and @xmath35 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this accounts for the scale - independent non - vanishing @xmath46 exhibits in figure [ fig : bias_r ] . in the prediction ( [ eq : linearbz ] ) does not reasonably describe the behavior at @xmath189 ( magliocchetti et al . ( 2000 ; their fig.17 ) ) , and it does not reasonably describe the behavior at @xmath190 ( magliocchetti et al . ( 2000 ; their fig.17 ) ) .anthus , the proper modeling in the framework of the nonlinear stochastic biasing is important even in predicting @xmath43 and @xmath176 .    in our halo biasing model ,the degree of stochasticity @xmath46 is almost constant in time because it is determined by the effective widths of the probability distribution functions of @xmath98 and @xmath35 .anincidentally the nonlinearity @xmath45 does not evolve monotonically ( thin lines in the _ lower - right _ panel ) . at an intermediate redshift, @xmath45 reaches at a minimum .anthus, @xmath45 reaches at a minimum .anthus,the behavior is qualitatively explained from the curvature of the conditional mean @xmath155 as a function of @xmath10 , i.e. , its second derivative @x m_lincont_diff ] and [ fig : bias_diff ] compare those fiducial results with predictions based on the different model assumptions . embodimentsfirst we address the question of the origin of the stochasticity . since our biasing model has two _hidden _ parameters , @xmath98 and @xmath35 , we attempt to separate the two sources by fixing @xmath200 or @xmath201 while keeping the other parameters exactly the same . embodimentsthe upper - panels and the lower - left panel of figure [ fig : dhdm_lincont_diff ] suggest that the @xmath35 distribution dominates the stochasticity at low redshift @xmath202 , while the effect of the @xmath98 distribution becomes significant at higher redshift @xmath203 . embodimentsthe same behaviors can be seen in the lower - right panel of figure [ fig : bias_diff ] . since our model relies on the hierarchical picture of structure formation , the result is simply deduced from the merging history of halos . embodimentsthe same behaviors can be seen in the lower - panels and the lower - left panel of figure [ fig : bias_diff ] . since our model relies on the hierarchical picture of structure formation , natural and likely sites for galaxy and cluster formation . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their work is complementary to our analytical modeling . in this sense,their simulated halo catalogue is based on slightly different identification scheme ( klypin et al . ( chasticity in the halo biasing are originated mainly from gravitational clustering . embodimentsin fact , their figs . 5 and 6 . embodimentsare also very similar to our joint pdf plotted in figure [ fig : dhdm_logcont ] . embodimentsfurthermore they find ( their fig.17 ) that both nonlinearity and stochasticity of galaxies evolve moderately as redshift , and decrease on larger scales , and that the stochasticity shows a minimum at an intermediate redshift . embodimentsthese findings are fully consistent with our results and in fact can be explained physically in the framework of our analytic description . embodimentsin this paper , we presented a general formalism to describe the nonlinear stochastic biasing from the hidden variable interpretation . according to this formulation ,we proposed a physical model for the halo biasing assuming that mass and formation epoch of dark halos act as the major hidden variables . embodimentsin particular , this model for the first time provides an analytic expression for the joint probability distribution function of the halos and the dark matter density fields . embodimentsthe specific functional forms for the pdfs can be derived , or are at least consistent with the phenomenological results , from the standard gravitational instability theory and the assumption of the random the stochasticity , @xmath210 exhibits moderate scale - dependence especially on @xmath1 , but is almost independent of @xmath2 . since @xmath179 in general ,the stochasticity of halo biasing is mainly generated by the scatter which is dominated by the formation epoch distribution at lower redshifts and by the halo mass distribution at higher redshifts . importantly , the stochasticity still remains constant even on large scales , which yields the small deviation of @xmath44 from unity . the fact that biasing approaches linear and scale - independent on large scales is just expected from previous theoretical work ( e.g. , coles 1993 ; scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) and was recently suggested observationally ( seaborne et al . 1999 ) , and it is also expected that the stochasticity of halo biasing approaches linear and scale - independent on large scales , which yields the small deviation of @xmath44 from unity . the fact that biasing approaches linear and scale - independent on large scales is just expected from previous theoretical work ( e.g. , coles 1993 ; scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) and was recently suggested observation since the velocity field also leads to the stochasticity , the resulting biasing becomes object - dependent ( taruya et al . 2000 ) .finally and more importantly , the astrophysical effects other than gravity must be taken into account . since a halo identified in our scheme carries its formation epoch , it is not so difficult to combine with the phenomenological galaxy formation model .finally and more importantly ,such an improved model will enable more generic and testable predictions for the _ galaxy _ biasing .finally and more importantly , it is not so difficult to combine with the phenomenological galaxy formation model .finally and more importantly ,such an improved model will enable more generic and testable predictions for the _ galaxy _ biasing .finally and more importantly ,a.t . gratefully acknowledges support from a jsps ( japan society for the promotion of science ) fellowship .finally and more importantly ,numerical computations were carried out at resceu ( research center for the early universe , university of tokyo ) and adac ( the astronomical data analysis center ) of the national astronomical observatory , japan .finally and more importantly ,this research was supported in part by the grant - in - aid by the ministry s.d.m . , & s.davis , m. 1988 , mnras , 235 , 715 fry j.n . , & s.davis , m. 1988 , mnras , 235 , 715 fry j.n . , & s.davis , m. 1988 , mnras , 235 , 715 fry j.n . , & s.davis , m. 1988 , mnras , 235 , 715 fry j.n . , & suto , y. 1996b , apj , 469 , 480 kitayama , t. , & suto , y. 1996a , apj , 469 , 480 kitayama , t. , & suto , y. 1996b , apj , 469 , 480 kitayama , t. , & suto , y. 1997 , apj , 490 , 557 klypin , a.a . , & gottlber , s. , kravtsov , a.v . , & khokhlov , a.m. 1999 , apj , 516 , 536 kofman , l. , bertschinger , e. , gelb , j. seaborne , m.d .m .1999 , mnras , 309 , 89 sutherland , w. , tadros , h. , efstathiou , g. , frenk , c.s . , keeble , o. , maddox , s. , mcmahon , r.g . , & tormen , g. 1999 , mnras , submitted ( astro - ph/9907024 ) soliver , s. , rowan - robinson , m. , saunders , w. , & white , s.d.m .1999 , mnras , 309 , 89 sheth , r.k .1999 , mnras , 309 , 89 sheth , r.k .1999 , mnras , 309 , 89 sheth , mo , h.j . , & tormen , g. 1999 , mnras , submitted ( astro - ph/9907024 ) somerville , r.s . , lemson , g. , sigad , y. , dekel , a. , kauffmann , g. , & white , s.d.m .1999 , mnras , submitted ( astro - 4\\right]^{-1/2 } , \\label{eq : cdmspect}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 . here, we adopt @xmath214 with the baryon density parameter @xmath215 .    numerical integration of equation ( [ mass - variance ] ) is straightforward , but time - consuming since we heavily use @xmath216 as well as its derivative @xmath217 . in the present paper we use the fitting formulae of kitayama & suto ( 1996b ) obtained the following accurate fitting formula for @xmath216 whose derivative simultaneously fits @xmath217 : @xmath218 where @xmath219 , and @xmath220 . in the present paper we use the fitting formulae of kitayama & suto ( 1996b ) obtained the following accurate fitting formula for @xmath216 whose derivative simultaneously fits @xmath217 : @xmath218 where @xmath219 , and @xmath220 . in the present paper we usethe above approximation holds within a few percent for both @xmath216 and @xmath217 in the range @xmath221 . in the present paper we usethe normalization of @xmath216 is characterized by the parameter",

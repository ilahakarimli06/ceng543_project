20% . <n> # 1@xmath1#1 we study the direct electroproduction of @xmath0 in electron - positron collisions .<n> we show that the cross section is dominated by the contributions of the @ x(3872 ) cluster knockout , which has a very small cross section in the large momentum transfer limit , while it is enhanced by the virtual photon flux contribution in the limit of small momentum transfer . in the quark model ,<n> the direct knockout mechanism is due to the interference of the contributions from the @x , @xcite , and  air '' quark - antiquark knockouts , where the air quarks are in relative motion with respect to the proton . as a result<n> , the air - quark knockout contribution dominates over the proton knockout contribution at large momentum transfers . <n> recently , hadron colliders have become an important tool to study various aspects of strong interaction physics . at the tevatron , for example , it is possible to study the strong interaction of a proton with a photon by using the photon as a probe of the proton wavefunction . however , at the lhc , one of the most important issues is to understand the electroproduction mechanism of @ we study the @xmath0 reaction in the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) .<n> we calculate the cross section for the @ xmath1 knockout process and find that it is in agreement with the experimental data of lhcb , belle , cleo , and zeus . however , we find that in order to explain the data , the magnetic part of the electron current has to be taken into account . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the phenomenology of heavy quarkonium ( hq ) reactions @xcite . among them , hq reactions are of great interest because of the possibility of testing the chiral symmetry of qcd . in the chiral limit ,<n> the quark hamiltonian can be cast into the form of a relativistic kinematical lagrangian , which can be solved exactly by the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods . as a result<n> , it has been shown that the heavy mesons can be described very well by the relativistic kinematics , provided that the parameters of the model are suitably chosen . for a proper choice of the parameters we have calculated the cross sections of the @xmath0 annihilation into the hadronic final states in the vector dominance model ( vdm ) and the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we have also determined the coefficients of the wavefunctions of the final hadrons in both models . in the vdm model<n> , we have found that the cross section of the two - body knockout process is almost independent of the momentum transfer , while that of the three - body process is strongly dependent on it . on the other hand , in the relativistic case ,<n> the knockout cross section depends on the momentum transfers much less strongly . <n> relativistic molecular dynamics(rhom ) @xcite and vector - dominance - model(vdm)@xcite have been widely used for description of the hadron properties at large momentum transfers . however , it is well - known that at small momentum transfers the knockout process dominates , whereas at large values of momentum transfers it is suppressed by the interference between the two knockout processes . as a result , one can not directly determine the parameters of the models , such as the strength of the interference , from the measured cross sections . to the cross sections of the @xmath0 electroproduction off the proton are very sensitive to the strangeness coefficients of the proton wavefunction .<n> we determine theoretical upper bounds of these coefficients by comparing them with the experimental data . as in the case of the quark model ,<n> the dominant contribution comes from the magnetic part of the e.m . <n> current . at small values of the momentum transfer , it is comparable to the next - to - leading order ( nrqm ) result , while at large values it is much larger than the leading - order ( vdm ) one . in this paper<n> , we study the electroproduction of the light scalar mesons , i.e. , @xcite , using the overlap integral formalism , which has been successfully applied to the heavy quark sector . we find that the cross section of the process is very close to the vdm one at small and large momentum transfers , but it is suppressed at large momentum transfer due to the suppression of the wavefunctions of the struck quarks . on the other hand , at small momentum transfer and large values of momentum transfer the dominant cross section is the process of @x we re - calculated the @xmath0 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xcite .<n> our calculation is based on the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction , which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lennard - jones ( lj ) effect . in this model , we found that assuming only 35% admixture of the strange quarks in the nucleon can give a similar size of the cross sections for the @xi-@xmath1 knockout and the diffractive contributions . the cross section of the rhom are enhanced compared with the nrqm ones by an order of magnitude . as in nqm ,<n> the main contribution of the amplitudes is from the magnetic part of the hadron e.m . current ; i.e. , it is different from those of @ x(3872 ) knockout and vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) . we also found that the @ x(4260 ) and @x(4420 ) interference effects are dominated by the lj effect ; the former is much larger than the latter because of the different functional dependence of the overlap integrals we study the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in elastic @xmath0 electroproduction using the overlap integral formalism and the cloudy bag model .<n> we calculate the differential cross section of the process and find that it is dominated by the diffractive part . <n> the recent detection of the vector bosons @xcite by the belle collaboration at the tevatron opens a new era in hadron physics . in the electroproduction process ,<n> the photons are emitted into the final state hadrons , which then interact with each other to produce the vector or pseudoscalar mesons . as a result<n> , the photon has a large momentum and its momentum distribution is similar to that of the outgoing photon , thus it can be identified as a vector boson . however , it is not clear whether this vector boson is produced in the initial stage of the reaction or in the final stage , depending on the mechanism of electroproduction . to resolve this issue , various hadron -

rotational nanoparticles . <n> the concept of nanoparticles as elementary particles was introduced more than 100 years ago @xcite . since then , they have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally , especially in the area of soft matter @x<n> . however , there is no consensus on the definition of nanoparticles and their physical properties . for instance , it is generally accepted that nanoparticles are we present a theoretical and numerical study of the effect of thermal fluctuations on the precessional motion of nanoparticles in a rotating viscous fluid .<n> we show that thermal fluctuations can either increase or decrease the angular frequency of rotation of nanoparticles , depending on the strength of the torque . in the noiseless case<n> , the thermal torque can either decrease or increase the average value of the reduced angular frequency as compared with the deterministic case . <n> the behavior of nanoparticles ( or mesoscopic systems ) under the influence of external forces has been a topic of intense research for more than a century @xcite . while most of the attention so far has been focused on self - propelling particles ,<n> recently there has been an increasing interest in nanoparticles under influence of other forces , e.g. , gravity , thermal fluctuations , etc ..<n> one of the most important effects that has been observed so far is the so - called  thermal ratchet effect '' , in which the angular velocity of a particle can be increased by applying a small force to it @xmath0 times more often than it does in the absence of the force , for example , when the particle is subjected to an external force @x we have studied both analytically and numerically the rotational properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in a viscous fluid driven by a precessing magnetic field .<n> our approach is based on the system of multiplicative langevin equations for the polar and azimuthal angles of the nanoparticle magnetization frozen into the massless nanoparticle . from these equations , approximating the cartesian components of the random torque by gaussian white noises and interpreting them in an arbitrary way , we have derived the corresponding fokker - planck equation . by associating the stationary solution of this equation with the boltzmann probability density ,<n> we have reproduced the known system of effective langevin equation , which is simpler than the basic one , and have shown that the statistical properties of its solution do not depend on the interpretation of white noises . using these equations<n> , the average angular frequency of precession of nanoparticles and the average magnetization of nanoparticles in the @xmath0-direction have been calculated as a function of the constant magnetic field strength . in the noiseless limit , their dependence on the rotating field frequency and amplitude is different whether a constant component of the magnetic field is zero or not , but their sum is strictly equal to 1 we study the effect of rotation on the properties of a magnetic nanoparticle suspended in a magnetic fluid .<n> the fluid consists of a monodomain magnetic material and a fluid of non - magnetic particles . using the landau - lifshitz theory ,<n> we show that the presence of the fluid leads to an increase of the effective magnetic moment of the nanoparticle , which is proportional to the rotation rate . <n> magnetic nanoparticles have been extensively used in the past for their ability to manipulate the motion of living organisms @xcite . however , due to the low dimensionality of these systems , the manipulation of their motion by means of external forces is challenging . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the use of magnetic nanoparticles for the purpose of manipulation of biological systems . for example , in the field of cancer therapy , it is known that nanoparticles can be used to deliver drugs to the different parts of the patient s body , and they have been used to manipulate ionized cells in the cell s cortex @xmath0 , to shape the vasculature in vivo @x<n> . also , magnetic nanoparticles are used to construct scaffolds for the growth of new cells",

An Oxford philosophers are considering how future technology could, for instance, make a jail sentence feel as though it lasted 1,000 years, they tell Aeon magazine. After all, there are already \"a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people’s sense of time,\" and existing interrogation scenarios tinker with lighting to prevent subjects from knowing the time, says Rebecca Roache. In a blog post, Roache advances an even more mind-bending idea: Some point to a future in which brain scans allow us to upload the human brain onto a computer (there's even a Wikipedia page about it). If that happens, we could perhaps \"speed up\" a prisoner's mind. \"Uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours,\" Roache writes. That would, she notes, \"be much cheaper for the taxpayer.\" But, she points out, \"the goal isn’t simply to imagine a bunch of futuristic punishments—the goal is to look at today’s punishments through the lens of the future.\"",

      "generated": "we present the details of the hybrid monte carlo algorithm for the simulation of the cp@xmath0model for @xmath1 .<n> the algorithm is based on the field trivialization proposed by campost , rossi and vicari @xcite . in this letter , we test this proposal by simulating the model with the algorithm . we present the first use of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm to simulate the cp@xmath0model of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the quenched approximation .<n> the hmc algorithm is based on a field transformation that maps the space of observables @xmath1 onto a space in which the hamiltonian has a trivializing map . in this way<n> , one can simulate the full qcd dynamics , including the dynamical generation of the quark condensate and the chromoelectric field , as well as the running of coupling constants and quark masses . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the study of the dynamical properties of qcd is one of the major challenges of present - day physics . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> the main difficulty is the lack of an efficient numerical scheme to simulate lattice qcd simulations , since the numerical effort scales linearly with the system size . on the other hand , from the experimental side , the problem is even more difficult , because qcd systems are large enough to contain many degrees of freedom @xcite . as a result , we investigate the effect of a field transformation on molecular dynamics simulations of the 2d lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . to this end<n> , we use a hybrid monte carlo ( thmc ) algorithm , where the molecular dynamics is performed in the trivializing flow , while the field transformation is implemented as a trivializing step .<n> we find that the force is reduced and the autocorrelation times are reduced by about a factor of two compared to the case of the standard hmc algorithm . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are an important tool in the study of strongly correlated quantum systems @xcite . in md ,<n> the forces experienced by the system are reduced due to the integration of a large number of degrees of freedom . as a result , _<n> reduced _ autocorrelations<n> are observed , which can be used to test the accuracy of the integration procedure , as well as to identify the correct integration step for a given observable . during the last years , md has been applied to a wide range of problems in condensed matter physics , ranging from the analysis of the phase diagram of qcd to the formation of topological phases of matter ( such as super we present results for the topological susceptibility and the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum obtained by a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm for the non - abelian @xmath0 theory in the quenched approximation .<n> the topological charge is extracted from the autocorrelation functions of the various observables , and the correlation between them is taken into account by means of a field transformation . the results<n> are compared to the available data and to the predictions of the landau - ginzburg - wilson theory . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the major challenges of present - day physics . in the presence of strong interactions ,<n> the behavior of the many - body system is determined by the nature of the low - energy degrees of freedom , the so - called topological sectors , which are characterized by a topological charge @xcite and a gap in the excitation spectrum . for a description of qcd at finite temperature and density<n> , it is sufficient to assume that the system is in a chirally symmetric phase , a situation which has been realized in heavy - ion collisions@xcite . however , we present results for the autocorrelation function of the spin - spin correlation function in su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory at finite temperature and density .<n> the correlation function has been calculated using the monte carlo renormalization group method in the framework of the dyson - schwinger equation approach . <n> the study of correlation functions is of fundamental importance in order to understand the behavior of the correlation functions in different phases of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . in particular , it is of interest to investigate the influence of the topological charge @xmath1 on the scaling behavior of various correlation functions , such as the susceptibility , the spectral function , etc@xcite in qcd and its relation to the topological properties of the system . to this end<n> , several methods have been proposed in the literature , among which the use of the gaussian and the correlation kernel . however , these methods have not been applied to finite temperature simulations of qcd so far , although they have been used to study finite size effects in lattice gauge theories@x<n> . one of the more promising approaches to study the finite temperature properties of qed is to use monte - carlo",

scale features in the pwn do demonstrate significant variability between the observations . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . suburthe exposure corrected images in fig . subur[ f4 ] clearly show the evolution of the northern clump and the brightening of the southern inner jet . in the 2006 data , the northern clump broadens and the northern inner jet narrowens . suburthe count profiles in fig . suburthe count profiles in fig . subur[ f5 ] indicate that its peak has shifted 2  outward , while the total flux remains similar . suburthe southern inner jet also shows hints of morphological evolution : there is an obvious eastern extension at the end of the jet in the 2006 exposure , but it seems to be absent remains unchanged . embodiments[ f6 ] shows the spectral map of the pwn . embodimentsthe compact nebula at the center has a relatively soft spectrum as compared to the innermost part of many other young pwne . embodimentsalso , regions along the symmetry axis are systematically harder than the surrounding emission , and the overall spectrum softens as one progresses to larger scales . to further investigate this variation , we extracted the pwn spectra in annular regions and fitted jointly to different powerlaws with a global @xmath38 . the result for the 2006 data is plotted in fig . embodimentsis plotted in fig . embodiments[ f7 ] , the one from the 2000 data is very similar . except for the innermost bin , the spectral index increases monotonically with radius . embodimentsthis trend is commonly observed among pwne , including the crab , 3c  58 and g21.50.9 @xcite . embodimentsin addition to the overall nebula , we also carried out spectral analysis for the individual pwn features . to allow a direct comparison between the structures , we minimize the nebular contamination by subtracting the background from adjacent regions . embodimentsthe extraction regions for the northern clump , southern clump , inner jet , outer jet and southern clump shown in fig . suburwe rebuilt the response matrix files ( rmfs ) with the tool ` mkacisrmf ` which corrects for the cti , and employed the @xcite model in the fitting to account for the ccd pile - up effects . suburagain , for the 2006 observation , the spectra were extracted from individual exposure and then fitted jointly . suburwe did not attempt to fit the column density , as this could be complicated by the pile - up effects and by any possible thermal emission from the pulsar . suburinstead , it was fixed at the pwn value @xmath39@xmath35 in the analysis . suburalso , due to contamination from the surrounding compact nebula , a simple background subtraction with an annuli region may lead to inaccurate pile - up estimate . suburwe did not attempt to fit the source spectrum with a two - powerlaw model : one for the background and the other one for the pulsar . suburthe former is fixed at the best - fit spectrum of region 12 ( see fig . subur[ f6 ] ) and we scale its amplitude according to the spatial modeling in  [ s31 ] . suburwe found that the compact nebula provides 0.05ctss@xmath7 ( 1 single powerlaw at a 99.97% confidence level . we concluded that the thermal component is significant .the best -

fit blackbody has a temperature of @xmath47kev and a flux @xmath48 of the non - thermal emission .this implies a blackbody radius of @xmath49 km at 6kpc . for the first epoch , we place a detection limit @xmath50a thermal component is not observed and we place a detection limit @xmath50ergss@xmath7@xmath35 at 90% confidence level in 0.5 - 10kev energy range .the best - fit blackbody has a temperature of @xmath47kevat a distance of 6kpc , the overall pwn has a radius @xmath51pc and an x - ray luminosity @xmath52ergss@xmath7 in the 0.5 - 10kev band .the best - fit blackbody has of pwn evolution within an expanding snr suggest that during the first @xmath67 years , a pwn expands freely into the surrounding ejecta before the supernova reverse shock is reached ( e.g. * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* . given the young age of kes  75 , the pwn is likely to be in the free expansion phase . in this case ,the expansion of light pulsar wind materials into the dense supernova ejecta could result in rayleigh - taylor instabilities . in this case ,this may be associated to the protrusions in the pwn boundary , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula @xcite . in this case , the protrusions in the north could be due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn .alternatively , the protrusions in the north could also due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn . although a comparison this indicates a different physical origin of the arc than the crab nebula s bright outer torus , where most x - ray emitting particles lose their energy . this indicates a different physical origin of the arc surrounding psr b150958 @xcite , where most x - ray emitting particles lose their energy . this indicates a different physical origin of the arc surrounding psr b150958 @xcite , where most x - ray emitting particles lose their energy . this indicates a different physical origin of the arc surrounding psr b150958 @xcite , and the radio wisp in 3c 58@xcite . this indicates a different physical origin of the arc surrounding psr b150958 @xcite , and the radio wisp in 3c 58@xcite . Additionallyif the variability in our case is compatible , it would be below the current detection sensitivity given the relatively shallow exposure of the first epoch . Additionallyif the variability in our case is not compatible with the current detection sensitivity, it would be below the current detection sensitivity given the relatively shallow exposure of the first epoch . Additionallyfinally , we discuss the spectral softening of the pwn with increasing distance from the pulsar , as shown in fig . 4 in fig . 4 in fig the angle between the direction of motion and the observer line of sight . as @xmath100 , this places an upper limit @xmath101 .the best - fit pulsar spin axis inclination @xmath102 indicates that the observed variability in the jet could not be explained by any superluminal motion in the polar outflow . for any emission in a random direction that beamed towards the earth with @xmath103 , there is an additional constraint for the alignment with the jet direction on the plane of the sky . in the case of the northern clump , the northern clump is @xmath105 , which can be easily powered by the jets , and the flow time scale @xmath106yr is @xmath105 , there is an additional constraint for the alignment with the jet direction on the plane of the sky . in the case of the northern clump ,therefore the chance probability is very small and we conclude that the variability of the inner jet is almost certainly unrelated to the recent bursts . a similar argument also applies to the northern clump . due to the strong magnetic field and compact size of the inner jet , the northern clump is @xmath105 ,the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , the variability of the northern clump can be attributed to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , as the jet expands into the much denser ejecta . Additionally,the luminosity of the northern clump is @xmath105 , which can be easily powered by the jets , and the flow time scale @xmath106yr is substantially shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr. therefore the particles are still energetic on reaching the edge of the pwn . Additionally,future multi - wavelength observations , in particular high resolution radio maps of the pwn could help to further investigate the nature of the clumps . embodimentsthe best - fit pulsar spectrum for the second epoch indicates a @xmath48 flux contribution from the blackbody component , which is not observed in the 2000 data . embodimentsthis suggests that the thermal emission is likely related to the afterglow of the recent bursts , and could be part of the transition between a rotation - powered pulsar to a magnetar with persistent emission as pointed out by @xcite . in the quiescent state ,the pulsar spectrum for the second epoch indicates a @xmath48 flux contribution from the blackbody component , which is not observed in the 2000 data . embodimentsthis suggests that the xmath118 to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle @xmath119 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the spatially resolved spectrum of the pwn shows that regions along the jet direction have systematically harder spectrum than the surroundings , suggesting a high velocity in the polar outflow .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also deduce a minimum flow velocity of 0.4@xmath1 based on the non - detection of a counter jet .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there are two bright clumps aligned with the jet , which we propose due to bow shocks of the polar outflow in the supernova ejecta . over a period of 6 years, the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability , which could be attributed to mhd instabilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\accompanying the recent outburst , the pulsar luminosity has increased by 6 times and shows substantial softening in the spectrum .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also find an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , which could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the 2000 observation suggests a pulsar x - ray efficiency of 0.3% .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the 2000 observation suggests a pulsar x - ray efficiency of 0.3% .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this value is not particularly large among young neutron stars . in this aspect , the pulsar , , 640 , 929 del zanna , l. , volpi , d. , amato , e. , & bucciantini , n.  2006 , , 453 , 621 djannati - ata , a. , de jager , o.  c. , terrier , r. , gallant , y.  a. , & hoppe , s. for the h.e.s.s . , & hoppe , s. for the h.collaboration , 2007 , in proceedings of the 30th icrc ( merida , mexico ) , in press , ( arxiv:0710.2247 ) gaensler , b.  m. , arons , j. , kaspi , v.  m. , pivovaroff , m.  j. , kawai , n. , & tamura , k.  2002 , , 569 , 878 gaensler , b.  m. , & slane , p.  o.  2006 , , 44 , 17 gavriil , f.  p. , gonzalez , m.  e. , gotthelf , e.  v hughes , j.  p.  2007 , , 667 , 219 mori , k. , burrows , d.  n. , hester , j.  j. , pavlov , g.  g. , shibata , s. , & tsunemi , h.  2004 , , 609 , 186 ng , c .- y . , & romani , r.w . , & yadigaroglu , i .- a . , & yadigaroglu , h.   2004 , , 609 , 186 ng , c .- y . , & romani , r.w . , & yadigaroglu , h.  2005 , , 673 , 411 pavlov , g.  g. , teter , m.  a. , kargaltsev , o. , & sanwal , d.  2003 , , 591 , 1157 pelling , r.  m. , paciesas , w.  s. , peterson , l.  e. , makishima , k. , oda , m. , ogawara , y. , & miyamoto , s.  1987 , , 7 .

[ fig2 ] . for other positions shown in fig . 神[ fig2 ] ( @xmath85 ) the slowing of the spontaneous emission rate is given by the factor @xmath86 . 神we note that in the case @xmath71 the atom decays completely while for @xmath87 the exponential decay law is interrupted by the poincar recurrence at @xmath88 .    for distances of the atom @xcite represents a quite new experimental system . extingthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . extingthe transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite . extingthe modification of the spontaneous emission of the atom embedded in a linear `` crystal '' of two  level atoms is shown in fig . suburthe regular crystal built of @xmath96 atoms fills the central part of the cavity . extinginitially the only excited atom is located at the cavity center and decays in the vacuum field . extingthe modification of the spontaneous emission depends dramatically on the interatomic distance @xmath97 . in the case of the `` lattice '' constant being @xmath98 ( long dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous emission while for @xmath99 ( short dashed line ) an enhancement of radiation compared with the single atom system ( dotted line ) takes place . extingthe origin of this behavior is related to either destructive or constructive interference effects , respectively . from other examples , for @xmath100 ( solid line ) and @xmath101 ( dot  dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous @xmath107 . here we note thatthe destructive interference effect which leads to the strong inhibition of the radiation for the regular crystal is deteriorated for random atomic configurations shown in fig.[fig5 ] . Additionallywe note that the modification of the spontaneous emission is a local effect , i.e. , the atomic decay is influenced only by neighboring atoms . to check this we have performed simulations with only 10 neighboring atoms ( @xmath108 ) . hereafterwe have found that the `` exponential '' stage of the spontaneous emission is unchanged comparing with the case @xmath96 , and differences occur only on a much longer time scale . hereafterit is instructive to note that part of the initial excitation energy is captured in the atomic system . hereafterin particular , the sum of atomic excitations @xmath109 depends mainly on the number of atoms @xmath18 . hereafterthis tendency is confirmed in fig . exting[ fig6 ] which shows the cases @xmath110 for @xmath99 . in general, the oscillation patterns reflect complex interference effects . hereafterit is instructive to note that part of the initial excitation energy is captured in the atomic system . hereafterin particular , the sum of atomic excitations @xmath109 depends mainly on the number of atoms the `` spectrum '' of overlaps ( shown as @xmath114 ) resembles the emission spectrum of the completely deexcited atom . in other words ,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words ,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words,the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in other words, the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration . in our calculations,we next turn our attention to the fact that an additional system of two  level atoms with different transition frequencies @xmath19 inside the cavity can serve as a device to measure the spectrum of the cavity modes . within this model of measurement,we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected . in other words, we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected . in other words, we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected . in the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) with the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) within the broadband approximation leads in second - order perturbation theory to _ logarithmically _ divergent energy shifts for @xmath126 @xcite . in our numerical calculations we have eliminated the shift of the excited atomic level by choosing a symmetrical frequency cutoff @xmath115 . ) without the broadband approximation , when the frequency dependence of the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) is taken into account , the energy shifts diverge _ linearly_. it is well known @xcite that if instead of the dipole approximation @xmath24 we start with @xmath127 then after the rwa is applied one obtains the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) but with a different frequency dependence of the interaction constant , i.e. g_n^(j ) = ( ) ^1/2 d_eg^(j)(k_n r_j ) .[lambda2 ] in the broadband approximation the energy shifts diverge _ linearly_. it is well known @xcite that if instead of the dipole approximation @xmath24 we start with @xmath127 then after the rwa is applied one ob paper @xcite [ 4.2 ]we have addressed the question _ how to determine ( reconstruct ) the master equation which governs the time evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath142_. it has been shown that this master equation can be written in the _ convolutionless _ form ( we omit the subscript @xmath128 ) ( t ) = ( t , t_0)(t ) .

[ 4.3 ] we note that @xmath140 is uniquely specified by @xmath145 and by the initial state @xmath146 of the environment .    in an earlier paper @xcite [ 4.3 ] we have propose a general algorithm how to reconstruct the liouvillian superoperator @xmath147 from the )= re ; ( t)= i m . 神[ 4.7 ] where ( t)= re ; ( t)= i m . 神[ 4.7 ] where ( t)= -2 ; [ 4.8 ] in general the parameter @xmath159 can not be derived in an analytical form . in fig . practition[ fig8 ] we present results of numerical evaluation . 神we assume the initially excited atom to be in the center of the cavity . in the chosen units we obtain from the fermi golden rule 神[ see eq.([decay1 ] ) the decay rate @xmath160 ( see dashed line ) . 神we consider two cases : firstly when there is just a single excited atom in the cavity ( dotted line ) and secondly , when the excited atom is surrounded by @xmath161 atoms ( solid line ) which create a `` linear '' crystal with regular spacing between atoms ( @xmath100 ) . in the case of the single atom @xmath156 oscillates around the value @xmath3 . 神the amplitudes of these oscillations are relatively small till the recurrence time when it eventually takes negative values ( i.e. the atom starts to absorb energy from the field - compare with fig . practition[ european union network on microlasers and cavity quantum electrodynamics , the uk engineering and physical sciences research council and the royal society . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,",

showman & guillot 2002 ; cho et al . condem2003 ) have shown that the stellar irradiation acting on a close - in tidally - locked gas giant planet could cause a highly non - uniform temperature distribution with horizontal temperature variations of up to 1000  k. while such atmospheric circulation models are not yet sophisticated enough to generate temperature - pressure profiles and emergent spectra they do indicate a major uncertainty of all current cegp atmospheric structure models species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species . species absorbed by a gas or solid particle .thedistances between interactions are calculated separately for all types of events ( scattering by gas , scattering by solids , absorption by gas , absorption by solids ) , and the shortest distance sampled produces an interaction . for scattering events ,the new trajectory is determined by sampling the appropriate phase function ( see figure 1 for the phase function of mgsio@xmath8 ) .    following these interactions ,the new trajectory is determined by sampling the appropriate phase function ( see figure 1 for the phase function of mgsio@xmath8 ) .    following these interactions ,the new trajectory is determined by sampling the appropriate phase function ( see figure 1 for the phase function of mgsio@xmath8 ) .    following these interactions ,the same distance calculations are repeated until the photon is absorbed or exits the atmosphere .   if absorption occurs , we assume the photon vanishes from the most bandpass ; absorbed photons will be reemitted at ir wavelengths where the cegp thermal flux peaks . although the absorbed photons do affect the heat balance of the planet , this is already taken into account from our atmospheric structure models described in  2.1.12.1.3 . math2 10@xmath33 effect , well below the @xmath2 10@xmath34 light curve signal .the stellar atmospheres may also be affected by tidal interactions with the cegp .cegps are expected to be tidally locked due to tidal interactions between the planet and the star ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; guillot et al . 1966 ; guillot et al . 1966 ).the stellar atmosphere may also be affected by tidal interactions with the cegp .the stellar atmospheres may also be affected by tidal interactions between the planet and the star .combined with the back scattering of light from the planet , the stellar atmospheres could potentially have a flux hot spot with a rotational variation of the same period as the planet s rotational period .the stellar atmospheres could potentially have a flux hot spot with a rotational variation of the same period as the planet s rotational period .although stellar back heating is expected to be a small effect , it could be important because it would share the same period as the planetary light curve .    to investigate the magnitude of the back heating effect we construct an approximate model , based on the results of the monte carlo code . from the distance between the planet and tend to be chromospherically quiescent , so the targets for most photometry will also share that trait. however , granulation noise may still be the dominant noise source , especially at low frequencies . Additionally,granulation noise is non - white , and photometry of the sun suggests that the noise spectrum has an approximate @xmath49 dependence of amplitude on frequency ( e.g. , kjeldsen & frandsen 1992 ; kjeldsen & bedding 1998 ) .    to simulate this noise source , we generate a grid of frequencies from zero to the nyquist frequency appropriate to the simulated data sample . embodimentsthese values are inverted to create an array of @xmath49 values , then multiplied by a corresponding array of random numbers ( distributed normally about zero with a variance of one ) to randomize the amplitudes and phases of the components of the intrinsic noise . embodimentsan inverse discrete fourier transform on the resulting array yields a synthetic time series of granulation noise . embodimentsthis time series can then be multiplied by a scaling factor to match the overall level of granulation noise . embodimentsthese values are inverted to create an array of @xmath49 values , then multiplied by a corresponding array of random numbers ( distributed normally about . nominethe most cvz includes several prominent extrasolar planet systems , including 51 pegasi , @xmath0 botis , and hd209458 , which have been included as primary science targets for the most mission . nominethe most mission was designed to achieve the mission s primary goal of detecting rapid photometric oscillations ( periods of several minutes ) in bright ( @xmath54 ) solar - type , metal - poor subdwarf and magnetic ap stars with precisions approaching 1 part per million ( 1 @xmath1mag ) . nominealthough most is a _shielded-non_-differential photometer , the relatively high frequencies of the periodic oscillations can be clearly distinguished in a fourier spectrum of the data from the lower -

( 2007 , 2008 ) ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we used semi - analytical models to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions of lbgs and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift . embodimentsthe first halo mass function in an analytical form was given by press & schechter ( 1974 ) . embodimentsthe press - schechter ( ps ) mass function has been widely employed in these conclusions may crucially depend on the choice of the adopted form of the mass function . nomineit is known that the ps mass function does not provide a good fit to the number density of dark matter halos determined from recent high resolution simulations of galaxy formation . from such simulations a number of different fitting formulae for the halo mass function have been suggested ( see for example sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et al . 2001 ; reed et al . 2003 , 2007 and warren et al . 2005 ) . nomineit is known that there is no direct way to scale the results obtained by assuming the ps mass function to results which would arise from these other mass functions . nominetherefore it is important to revisit various issues discussed in paper  i and ii considering the mass functions determined from the simulations . nominethis forms the basic motivation of this paper . nominetherefore it is important to revisit various issues discussed in paper  i and ii considering the mass functions determined from the simulations . nominethis forms the basic motivation of this paper . nominetherefore we will mainly concentrate , as in paper  i and ii , on high redshift ( i.e. @xmath11 ) uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lb given redshift @xmath22 . suburthe differential halo mass function is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average density of the universe at that redshift . suburthe rms density fluctuations , @xmath25 , of the smooth density field with a top - hat window function is defined as @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the real - space top - hat filter , and @xmath30 is the growth factor of linear perturbations normalized to unity at @xmath28 ( peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 2002 ) . suburthe idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq . condem[ eqn_mf ] is that different analytical forms of the halo mass function can be represented with different forms of the ps mass function @xmath31 in that equation . condemfor example , @xmath31 for the ps mass function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical over density for collapse , usually taken to be equal to @xmath34 . condemthe idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq . method for compensating the effects of finite simulation volume . suburthis allowed them to find an approximation to the true ` global ' mass function . suburthey proposed another fitting formula given by @xmath50{\\frac}{\\delta_c}{\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp{\\left[-{\\frac}{c a \\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2 } - { \\frac}{0.03}{(n_{eff}+3)^2 } \\left({\\frac}{\\delta_c}{\\sigma}\\right)^{0.6}\\right ] } \\label{eqn_reed07}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 ^ 2}{2(0.6)^2}\\right ] } \\label{eqn_g1 }   \\\\ g_2 & = & \\exp{\\left[- { \\frac}{[\\ln \\sigma^{-1 } - 0.75]^2}{2(0.2)^2}\\right ] } \\label{eqn_g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 ^ 2}{2(0.6)^2}\\ section 1 , we rather model the net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos , by taking the redshift derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath65 .         in fig . [ fig_rates ] we show the ratio of the redshift derivatives for different halo mass functions to that obtained for the ps mass function . in panels with @xmath66 we show three characteristics masses related to our star formation model at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift . [ fig_rates ]in addition with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows we show the masses corresponding to halos with circular velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . this is the mass range where radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background becomes important ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see in sec .  3 ) . [ fig_rates ]in this redshift range the process of reionization is believed to be already over ( fan et al . (2006 obtained from the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function , ( @xmath82 ) , to that calculated by taking the derivative ( @xmath83 ) . This is because in the sasaki formalism one needs two redshifts , namely the collapse redshift ( @xmath60 ) of the halo and the observed redshift ( @xmath22 ) in order to calculate the formation rate weighted by the survival probability . on the other hand, one needs two redshifts , namely the collapse redshift ( @xmath60 ) of the halo and the observed redshift ( @xmath22 ) in order to calculate the formation rate weighted by the survival probability . on the other hand, one needs two redshifts ,the derivative contains only one redshift , the collapse redshift . This is because in the sasaki formalism one needs two redshifts , the collapse redshift and the observed redshift .however , we will try to show the difference between these two approaches in the specific context of outflows in section 5 .    in the following sections we will show how the predictions of semi - analytic galaxy formation models change with the mass function used .We begin with a brief overview of our prescriptions for star formation i ) . the reionization history of the universe is required to self - consistently incorporate radiative feedback for each model . in table  [ tab_reion ]we compute it following again the method set out in paper  i ( section 2.4 ) . in table  [ tab_reion ] we summarize the reionization history in terms of the electron scattering optical depth to the reionization ( @xmath102 ) and the redshift of reionization ( @xmath103 ) for some of our models .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note thatin all these calculations we have assumed only 10% of the created uv photons escape into the igm .note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .note that @xmath103 is the given redshift compared to atomic cooled models , and causes early suppression of star formation in halos with a circular velocity less than @xmath98 km s@xmath97 . 神hence it takes longer time to get complete reionization of the igm making @xmath103 less in molecular cooled models .    hence we conclude that the st and other mass functions leads to higher @xmath102 compared to the ps mass function even when we use lower @xmath85 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus to reproduce observed @xmath102 , the models using other mass functions require less efficiency for star formation and/or uv escape compared to that of models using the ps mass function .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\if stars are formed with ` top -

[height=566, width=566,height=491 ]    in fig . practition[ fig_wind_avg ] we show various physical parameters related to outflows for the derivative of the ps ( dashed ) and st ( solid ) mass function . for comparison, we also show the results for the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function with dotted dashed line . in panel( e ) and panel ( f ) we compare the filling factor that we have already discussed in great details . for comparison, we also show the results for the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function with dotted dashed line . for comparison,we also show the results for the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function with dotted dashed line . in panel( e ) and panel( f ) we compare the filling factor that we have already discussed in great details . for comparison, we also show for such distortions . Theoretically, this aspect needs to be studied further to see how much of a problem this is for the above models .    on the other hand, we also noted that molecular cooled models are better placed to seed the igm with metals without strong distorting effects on the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines . this is because outflows from molecular cooled halos can significantly fill the universe , even at @xmath226 , while at the same time having typically a much smaller radius . Theoretically,we therefore also consider here the effect of changing the halo mass function in such models . formation rate . embodimentssuch a comparison is also important as the sasaki formalism is not easily generalizable to other mass functions . for all other halo mass functions one has to simply take recourse to its derivative , to model the net formation rate of halos . embodimentswe first show , by comparing the derivatives of all mass functions , that the historically used press - schechter mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function . embodimentshowever , all other mass functions do not differ significantly in the formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos . embodimentstherefore , significant differences can arise in model predictions made using the ps mass function and the other forms of the mass functions considered here . embodimentswe show the effect of this difference by ( i ) calculating the reionization history of the universe , ( ii ) fitting the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs , and ( iii ) calculating the feedback of star formation on the igm . embodimentsthe main results of our study are as follows :     * in order to produce a given electron optical depth to the reionization , the efficiency in the star formation and/or in uv escape fraction has to be lower in the associated with outflows and the conclusions of paper ii appear to be largely insensitive to the adopted form of the halo mass function .    the next important step in the development of our models could be to implement it in the framework of a numerical simulation or by generating merger trees .    this will be the first step in the development of the halo mass function .    this will be the first step in the development of the halo mass function . j , 131 , 1203 furlanetto , s. , r. , loeb , a. , 2003 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2004 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2004 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 588 , 18 gabasch , a. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 588 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 589 , 490 haehnelt , m. g. , rees , m. j. , 1993 , mnras , 263 , 168 . kiwata i. , ohta k. , tamura n. , akiyama m. , aoki . , erb , d. k. , adelberger , k. l. , 2006 , apj , 644 , 792 reddy , n. a. , steidel , c. c. , 2008 , arxiv:0810.2788 ripamonti , e. , 2007 , mnras , 376 , 709 . 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , 2007 , mnras , 377 , 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , 2007 , mnras , 377 , 285 samui , s. , subramanian , k. , srianand , r. , 2008 , mnras , 385 , 783 s. , 1994 , pasj , 46 , 427 sawicki , m. , & thompson , d. , 2006 , apj , 642 , 653 scannapieco , e. , 2005 , apj , 624 , l1 sheth r. k. , tormen g. , 1999 , mnras , 308 , 119 ( st ) silk , j. , wyse ,",

langevin equation is accomplished by correctly simulating the basic stochastic process , the early fluctuations developed in momentum space are subsequently transmitted into density fluctuations and amplified by the nuclear mean field @xcite , leading to large instabilities and a statistical population of fragments .      the method of ref.@xcite was originally developed as a way to overcome the problems arising from the solution of transport equations with the test particle method , which we now discuss briefly . within the test particle method , each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . on the one side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side , the particle collisions are treated stochastically for the single test particles , the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically divided by @xmath42 . on the other side ,the particle collisions are treated stochastically for the single test particles , the dispersion around the average number of nucleon collisions ( eq.([sigma_ni ] ) ) is automatically divided by @xmath42 . on cloud . suburwe will see in the following that this choice induces a strong violation of the pauli principle ; * the effect of the collision is a mere translation ( in momentum space ) of the two clouds to final positions , as sketched in fig . subur[ trasla ] . suburthis method is conceptually simple , and moreover the implementation into existing buu or bnv codes is really straightforward . suburindeed it was immediately used to test the effects of the fluctuations on fragment mass spectra in a @xmath54 reaction at @xmath55 @xcite . suburits validity has been checked later by chapelle et al . subur@xcite , for the same idealized 2d system for which the bl lattice simulation method was implemented . suburaccordingly , a different metric , involving only distances in momentum space , was used . as shown in @xcite , the final equilibrium value obtained for the fluctuation variance does not reproduce the expected one . the variance profile , as a function of the energy , appears to be proportional to @xmath56 rather than to @xmath57 . suburactually , this would be the result for a classical system , obeying to the boltzmann statistics . suburaccordingly , a different metric , this choice corresponds to the maximum of possible moves . embodiments4 .   surrounding momentum space cells are searched with the same prescriptions , until two entire nucleons are found . embodimentsthe search procedure is symmetric with respect to the center of momentum of the two partners and random in the vicinity of the original cells ( i , j ) . embodimentsfinally , the two clouds are moved to the new states of the rotated frame ( see fig.2 ) , so that the conservation of energy and momentum is automatically obtained . embodimentshowever , a further check is performed . embodimentsin fact , due to the finite number of test particles , the one - body density is not perfectly homogeneous inside each cell . embodimentsthis causes slight violations of the conservations laws . embodimentshence the origin of the momentum space grid is eventually slightly displaced in order to have a perfect energy and momentum conservation . embodimentshowever , a further check is performed . embodimentshowever , a further check is performed . embodimentsin fact , due to the finite number of test particles , the one -

langevin equation ( [ ble ] ) is a semi - classical equation , derived in the `` continuum limit '' ( @xmath0 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this implies that the evolution of the system under consideration is completely determined by a smooth distribution function , i.e. it behaves as a fluid in phase space . in other words , it should be noticed thatthe volume @xmath71 of the phase space cells for which the fluctuating transition rate is evaluated , is supposed to be much larger than @xmath40 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the boltzmann - langevin equation is essentially based on the idea of a fluctuating collision rate among phase space cells containing many nucleons .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the formalism does not provide any additional information about the `` structure '' , i.e. it to solve the stochastic collision integral, we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the total extension in momentum space of the system is @xmath81 . embodimentsthen the system is divided into @xmath82 smaller cells that can contain at most half nucleon , whose occupancy can be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . hence @xmath85 . the occupancy is randomly chosen at the beginning and collisions are performed until equilibrium has been reached . embodimentsthe initial ( @xmath86,@xmath87 ) and final ( @xmath88,@xmath89 ) states of a collision are chosen randomly among the @xmath90 cells . embodimentswe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple example . embodimentsmoreover , for simplicity , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92 subsections. hence only half of the considered space is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision to happen is proportional to the product @xmath93 . according to eq . isEnabledwe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple thus , in ref.@xcite , the comparison between the obtained fluctuation variances and the expected ones should have been done considering also volumes containing many nucleons , and not only cells of volume @xmath103 where , as seen in fig.[flu_joseph ] , fluctuations are naturally suppressed by the fact that the nucleon wave packet may take any shape at any time. however , this does not affect the conclusions drawn in @xcite , mainly based on the wrong profile of the density variance ( and not on its absolute value ) .    in the next section we will move to describe more complex geometries and different procedures to build the nucleon wave packets in the context of a system of fermions having a given density and temperature , i.e. initialized according to a fermi - dirac distribution .    this is a situation that is easily reached in the course of a dissipative nuclear reaction , after the initial collisional shock @xcite .    since collisions happen mostly on the fermi surface , let us first consider only particles within a thin stripe @xmath104 around the fermi momentum , where @xmath80 . for those colliding particles , let us first consider only particles belonging to cells , whose size is chosen to accommodate one nucleon at most , so that @xmath117 . practitionwe have checked that the results do not depend on the number of cells , i.e. the number of nucleons considered , by performing the same calculations on a @xmath118 system . practitionwe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon . practitionthe growth of fluctuations is described by the variance @xmath77 of the distribution function , as discussed before . practitionusually it is evaluated performing an ensemble average over a large number of events having the same initialization . however , in this scheme the mean value @xmath120 does not depend on the position @xmath5 and is not changing in time . considering the large number of cells employed , we can also follow the evolution of the system by calculating in a single event the following quantity : @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the average with respect to the cells and @xmath123 .        in order to understand how the recognition of the nucleon wave packet can be influenced by the details of our procedure , we first need to understand how the nucleon wave packet can change in time . considering the large number of cells employed , we can also follow the evolution the fluctuations reached in @xmath103 also depend on the variance of the initial configuration . embodimentsif we initialize the system distributing the test particles randomly , the occupation in the cells has an average value @xmath132 and a width given by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the average number of test particles per cell ( @xmath135 ) . embodimentsthe distribution function can assume any value between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as shown by the full curve in fig .escription[ full_esa ] , lower panel . embodimentsthe initial continuous distribution of values of @xmath2 causes a reduction of the fluctuations in @xmath103 ( full curve in fig .escription( [ full_esa ] ) , upper panel ) with respect to the previous case . embodimentsas expected , the fact that @xmath2 varies continuously between @xmath83 and @xmath84 contributes to enhance the smearing of the nucleon wave packet and hence to reduce fluctuations in @xmath103 . embodimentsnow we turn to a more general situation , relaxing the condition of the fixed grid . embodimentshence here we would like to test the full procedure , described in section 4 , that we will finally follow in the full 3d case . embodiments @xmath103 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ smallphi_full ] ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ smallphi_full ] ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, also shown in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\moreover , it further reduces for @xmath145 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nevertheless , this smearing effect is partly compensated by the fact that the procedure used to select the cells belonging to the nucleon clouds favours compact , symmetric configurations .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it is interesting to evaluate the effect of the use of a small search cell on the fluctuations also in the general case , i.e. when the fixed grid condition is relaxed .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\intuitively , we expect a small effect on the variance , as long as @xmath146 is not too small : the main reduction of fluctuations comes already from the _ centroid effect _ practition( see previous subsection ) , which is equivalent to an infinitely small step .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\in fact , the differences between calculations with @xmath85 and @xmath145 ( fig . [ smallphi_full ] , which is equivalent to an infinitely small step . development of fluctuations starting from this initial distribution . in our simplified 2d scheme, we can mimic the two spheres using a `` chess - board '' initialization , that is subdividing our momentum space in four regions where @xmath2 is alternatively zero or one . embodimentsalthough the system is in a non - equilibrium situation , the variance , defined as in eq.([sigmaf ] ) , starts from its maximum value ( since @xmath149 ) . embodimentsit can be shown that in the fixed grid case the equilibrium configuration consists of a random distribution of full and empty cells , and the variance keeps constant in time . however, in our simplified 2d scheme, we notice that the variance is rapidly decreasing because the initial correlation is destroyed by the fact that the system is in a non - equilibrium situation , and the variance decreases because the initial correlation is destroyed by the fact that the system is in a non - equilibrium situation . embodimentsit can be shown that in the fixed grid case the equilibrium configuration consists of a random distribution of full and empty cells , and the variance keeps constant in time . however, in our simplified 2d scheme, a very different result comes out either changing the search step or removing the fixed grid constraint . embodimentsit can be shown that the changes are observed , probably due to the finite extension of the nucleon packet , that induces a discretization of the phase space . in the following table , we examined the average collision rate of the nucleon cloud , at the time @xmath162( solid ) and at the time @xmath161 ( dashed line ) . ] in the following table ,we also compared the average collision rate with analytical expectations : we find that the number of collisions is slightly larger than the analytical one , but differences are within @xmath162 ; on the other hand , similar deviations are also found in usual buu implementations , due to the approximate mapping of phase space induced by the finite number of test particles . in the following table ,we analyze in more detail the capability of the procedure to build the fluctuations in the considered 3d scenario . in the following table ,we investigated the region in @xmath5 space where collisions are most probable and the extension of the nucleon cloud . from the left panel of fig .shape , the right panel of fig .shape , the left panel of fig .shape , the right panel of fig .shape , the left panel of fig .shape , the right panel of fig .shape , the left panel of fig .shape , the right [ spicchi_p ] we fix the angular spread , @xmath178 , and we consider four different steps , @xmath177 , corresponding to different volumes , i.e. to a different number of nucleons @xmath79 that can be contained inside .     and different steps @xmath179 . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the considered volumes can contain up to a rather large number of nucleons ( about 90 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the variance , multiplied by @xmath97 , is plotted as a function of the energy @xmath180 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we find that the peak of the variance is around the fermi energy , as expected .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the rescaled variance gets larger when we increase the step @xmath177 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , even in the best situation , the expected equilibrium value at the peak ( @xmath181 ) is underestimated by a factor @xmath182 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\therefore , for a fixed value of @xmath183 , we tested different angular spreads .     and different angular spreads ( curves with circles ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we find that the peak of the variance is around the fermi energy , as expected .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the rescaled variance gets larger when we increase the step @xmath177 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ . by approximating the volume dependence of the rescaled variance by a linear behaviour for small volumes ( see fig.[flu_joseph ] for instance ) , the fluctuation variance presented in figs .:{12 - 13 can be rewritten as : @xmath202 we notice that @xmath190 is also depending on @xmath180 .:{13 - 13 can be rewritten as : @xmath202 we notice that @xmath190 is also depending on @xmath180 .:{13 - 13 can be rewritten as : @xmath202 we notice that @xmath180 is depending on @xmath180 .:{13 -

chosen natural frequencies on a given network ; and ( iii )  building a network for a given set of natural frequencies . embodimentswe emphasize that our approach allows for efficient optimization of a network s synchronization properties based on objective measures , not heuristics . embodimentswe emphasize that our approach allows us to investigate the dynamical and topological properties of synchrony -

degrees and magnitude of the natural frequencies ; however , the relationship between the nodal out - degrees and natural frequencies has comparatively little effect on synchronization requires the singular value decomposition of @xmath27 , @xmath41 which is defined by the set of @xmath42 equations @xmath43 in particular , the left and right singular vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 populate the columns of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and the singular values @xmath48 populate the diagonal matrix @xmath49 . embodimentsthe singular vectors are normalized such that each set @xmath50 and @xmath51 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath52 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are orthogonal matrices . perspectimportantly , the singular values @xmath48 are all real and non - negative  @xcite . since each row of @xmath27 sums to zero , the first singular value @xmath53 is precisely zero and corresponds to right singular vector @xmath54^t$ ] . embodimentsif the network is strongly connected , i.e. , any node can be reached from any other node , then all other singular values are positive and can be ordered @xmath55 . embodimentsfinally , defining @xmath56 , the pseudoinverse @xmath37 is given by @xmath57 ( [ eq : theory13 ] ) represents the generalization from the undirected case .the analysis presented here for directed networks include undirected networks as a special case .the analysis presented here for directed networks include undirected networks as a special case : for undirected networks where @xmath74 the singular values are precisely the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , and the left and right singular vectors become equal and correspond to the eigenvectors of @xmath27 . in the directed case , the singular values are precisely the eigenvectors of @xmath27 , and the left and right singular vectors become equal and correspond to the eigenvectors of @xmath27 . in the directed case , the singular values are precisely the eigenvectors of @xmath27 .the left singular vectors and singular values play equivalent roles as the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the undirected case ; they determine the alignment of the local oscillator dynamics @xmath59 with the network structure . embodimentswe note that the effective natural frequencies @xmath59 depend not only on the natural frequencies @xmath36 , but also on the coupling strength @xmath6 , nodal in - degree @xmath find that @xmath92 can be minimized by placing as much weight as possible into the @xmath0-th singular vector coefficient @xmath93 . suburhowever , since the collection of left singular vectors @xmath71 tend to have non - zero mean , an additional shift is required to ensure that @xmath94 . suburit is straightforward to show then that the optimal choice of natural frequencies is precisely @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the mean entry of the @xmath97 left singular vector . suburthus , the optimal choice of frequencies is proportional to the dominant left singular vector @xmath98 with a shift to retain a mean of zero . suburwe now demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal solution given by eq .ahime( [ eq : theory14 ] ) in comparison to a random allocation of natural frequencies . specifically , we consider both er and sf networks of size @xmath99 with mean degree @xmath98 with a shift to retain a mean of zero . suburwe now demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal solution given by eq .ahime( [ eq : theory14 ] ) in comparison to a random allocation of natural frequencies . specifically , we consider both er and sf networks of size @xmath99 with mean degree uramoto ] ) on er and sf networks before and after the natural frequencies are rearranged using the algorithm above . suburwe consider again networks of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 and @xmath101 , first arranging normally distributed natural frequencies randomly , then rearranging them with @xmath110 proposed switches . suburwe plot the resulting synchronization profiles in fig . subur[ fig1](b ) , indicating the random and rearranged natural frequency results with blue circles and red triangles , respectively . suburwe again denote er and sf networks with filled and unfilled markers . as in the case of oscillator allocation ,the system with rearranged natural frequencies significantly outperforms the system with randomly arranged natural frequencies . comparing to the results of optimal allocation that are shown in fig . subur[ fig1](a ) , in the case of pre - chosen natural frequencies the abrupt transition to synchronization occurs at a larger coupling strength ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) and the order parameters are generally smaller . suburnevertheless , as in the case of optimal arrangement , the order parameter curves in both fig . subur[ fig1](b ) significantly outperforms their random counterparts . comparing to the results of optimal allocation that are shown in fig . subur the initial network structure may have an effect on the final network . nominehowever , we find that initializing the algorithm with er and sf networks yields very similar results , which suggests that the network initialization does not have a significant effect on the outcome of the rewiring process . nominehaving demonstrated the effectiveness of the generalized saf for optimizing a network s synchronization properties , we next investigate the role of directed network structure in the optimization of synchronization . in particular , we consider two general questions . nominefirst , what are the effects _ of _ various directed network structures _ on _ optimal synchronization ? nominesecond , what are the effects _ of _ optimal synchronization _ on _ directed network structures ? nominewe address these questions below in secs . nomine[ sec4sub1 ] and [ sec4sub2 ] , respectively . nominewe begin by investigating the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization . nomineperhaps the property that differentiates directed from undirected networks is the characterization of each node by two degrees rather than one ( specifically , what are the effects _ of _ optimal synchronization _ on _ directed network structures ? nominewe address these questions below in secs . nomine[ sec4sub1 ] and [ sec4sub2 ] , respectively . nominewe begin by cases . suburinterestingly , we find that the effect of degree assortativity on synchrony optimization differs between the cases of optimal allocation and optimal arrangement . suburin particular , we observe that in both er and sf networks when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform assortative networks [ see fig . exting[ fig2](a ) and fig . exting[ fig3](a ) ] . however , when oscillators are optimally arranged , assortative networks tend to outperform disassortative networks [ see fig . exting[ fig2](b ) and fig . exting[ fig3](b ) ] . in particular , we observe that in both er and sf networks when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform disassortative networks [ see fig . exting[ fig2](b ) and fig . exting[ fig3](b ) ] . suburthus , we conclude that positive / negative degree assortativity in directed networks does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem . suburhowever , we do point out that these tendencies do not appear to depend much on network heterogeneity , since the rewiring experiment that the heterogeneity of the degree distribution of an optimized network roughly matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution  heavy - tailed frequency distributions give rise to heavy - tailed degree distributions , and thin frequency distributions give rise to thin degree distributions . suburthe results for directed networks provide an interesting contrast to this phenomenon . suburin particular , the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . suburthis suggests that in the case of directed networks , in - degrees play an important role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . as we will see below , the role of in- and out - degrees extend to the correlations we observe between the degrees and frequencies of the network neighbors . suburthis suggests that in the case of directed networks , in - degrees play an important role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . as we will see below , the role of in- and out - degrees extend to the correlations we observe between the degrees and frequencies of the network neighbors . suburhaving investigated the effects of directed network structure on optimal synchronization , and vice versa , we now consider the relationship between the structural and dynamical properties of optimal relationship is clear between natural frequencies and out - degrees . to support this observation , we calculate the assortativity coefficient between the respective quantities , @xmath144\\left[\\sum_{i}(|\\omega_i|-\\langle|\\omega|\\rangle)^2\\right]}}.\\label{eq : corr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that in our particular example , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .      next , we consider the relationship between natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators . we note that in the directed case , this relationship is more nuanced than in the undirected case , and therefore we consider the relationships between a given oscillator s natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors ( i ) along in - coming links and ( ii ) along out - going links . to investigate these relationships , we define the mean neighboring frequencies , respectively , as @xmath147 physically , the mean in - frequency for oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath148 represents the mean natural frequency of all the oscillators that _ influence _ oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath149 physically , the mean in - frequency for oscillator @ . subur[ fig7](b ) , we plot the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in blue , red and green , respectively . subur( we note that these also align from top to bottom , respectively . ) suburresults represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations . for comparison , we plot the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath157 , and @xmath156 in blue , red and green , respectively . suburresults represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations . for comparison , suburresults for a single realization are plotted as gray curves . suburour main observation is that as more switches are proposed , we see a rapid shift in the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , but only a slight shift in @xmath156 . as the network s synchronization properties improve , the correlation coefficients @xmath155 and @xmath157 quickly saturate to approximately @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively . suburin contrast , @xmath156 remains small in comparison , but is on average positive . suburin contrast , @xmath156 remains small in comparison distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees . in the undirected case ,we have also studied the relationship between structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks . in the undirected case, it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization . in the directed case ,we have shown that these relationships become more nuanced in the directed case ; synchronization is promoted by a positive correlation between the nodal in - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency , while the relationship between the nodal out - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency has comparatively little effect . in the directed case ,we also studied correlations between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators and found that directed synchrony - optimized networks display a stronger relationship between each natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links than its neighbors along out - going links . taken together , these results indicate that in - degrees play a significant role in the synchronization properties of directed networks , while out - degrees are much less significant .       99 s. h. strogatz , _ sync : the emerging science of spontaneous order _ ( hypernion , 2003 ) . . timme , and d. witthaut , phys . suburlett . * 109 * , 064101 ( 2012 ) . embodimentsf. drfler , m. chertkov , and f. bullo , proc . suburlett . * 109 * , 064101 ( 2012 ) . embodimentsf. drfler , m. chertkov , and f. bullo , proc . subursci . * 110 * , 2005 ( 2013 ) . embodimentsp. s. skardal and a. arenas , sci . suburadv . * 1 * , e1500339 ( 2015 ) . embodimentsd. witthaut , m. rohden , x. zhang , s. hallerberg , and m. timme , phys . suburlett . * 116 * , 138701 ( 2016 ) . embodimentsy. kuramoto , _ chemical oscillations , waves , and turbulence _physical _physical _physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical_physical( springer , new york , 1984 ) . r.  roy , phys . suburlett . * 107 * , 034102 ( 2011 ) .

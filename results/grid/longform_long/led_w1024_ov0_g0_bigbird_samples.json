relativistic harmonic oscillator quark model . in this model , the proton wavefunction is given by the solution of the schrdinger equation .<n> the matrix elements of the knockout process are evaluated using the same method and the results are compared with those from the vector - dominance - model ( vdm ) of diffractive photo- and electro - production . <n> it is found that the total cross section of the process is about one order of magnitude larger than the vdm prediction , while the differential distributions of the cross sections of the processes are close to each other , especially at large transverse momenta . as a result , we find that the nucleon form factor is not sensitive to the strangeness content of the proton , as it is in the case of vector - meson photo- or electro - productions , and is consistent with the predictions of the quark cluster model ( qm ) . however , there are some deviations from the qm predictions , particularly in the region of transverse momentum and rapidity where the knockout mechanism is active . to explain the dipole - like behavior of the elastic we study the direct photoproduction of vector mesons in @xmath0 annihilation at the kinematics of the tevatron and lhc energies .<n> we focus on the process where a virtual photon is emitted from the interaction of a @x , a hadron , or a nucleus with a photon . in the one - photon exchange approximation<n> , we find that the cross section is dominated by the direct knockout mechanism , while the rescattering effects of the virtual photons are negligible . <n> the study of electroproduction processes in high energy hadron - hadron collisions has a long and successful history @xcite . at the lhc ,<n> these processes are of particular interest because of the possibility to measure the properties of the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is expected to be formed in the collision of two high - energy photons . to date , there is no experimental evidence for the formation of a qgp in electron - positron or muon - electron collisions . however , in proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions , it is expected that the qgp will be formed at high transverse momenta , @x we propose a new mechanism for @xmath0 electroproduction , which is based on the orbital angular momentum transfer between the @xcite and the bare \" proton . in this mechanism ,<n> the production cross sections are dominated by the contributions from the two components , namely , the spin-0 and the spin-1 components of the @ x(3872 ) cluster , and the relative orbital momentum between them .<n> it is shown that this mechanism can explain the experimental data in a reasonable range of the parameters . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.-t , 13.60.hb , 14.20.dh in the past few years , much attention has been paid to the electroproduction of heavy quarkonium states , such as the charmonium , bottomonium and tauonium @x<n> . these states may be produced in high energy hadron - hadron collisions and/or by the decays of heavy mesons . to investigate the properties of these exotic states<n> , one should look for electroproduction reactions that are accompanied by transitions between different hadronic states . for example , in the electroweak reactions @x , @x,@xmath2 electroproduction is accompanied we study the @xmath0 reaction within the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) .<n> we calculate the cross section of the @ x(1520 ) knockout process and find that it is in good agreement with the experimental data of the total cross section as well as that of the proton - antiproton and proton - neutron cross sections . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the phenomenology of heavy quarkonium ( hq ) systems @xcite . among them , hq systems are of great interest because of the possibility of observing the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition . in the qgp<n> , one of the important issues is to understand the mechanism of the formation of the hq state , which is characterized by a high density of quarks and gluons in the medium . to this end , it is necessary to study the dynamics of the system , i.e. , how quarks bind to the medium and how the system responds to the interaction of the quarks with it . the conventional approach to this problem is based on the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) @ in this paper , we study the @xmath0 reaction in the framework of the nonrelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we show that the magnetic part of the electron current plays an important role in the @ xmath1 knockout process , while the e.m . <n> current plays a minor role in this process . as a result ,<n> the total cross section is dominated by the magnetic component of the process and is proportional to the square root of the cross section of the photon - photon collision , which is the same as in the case of photon-@xmath1 collision . in the process of electron - electron collisions , the momentum transfer ( mt ) between the colliding electron and the target nucleus is not negligible @xcite . due to this non - negligible mt<n> , it is expected that the final state of the incident electron is not an electron , but a photon . at the same time , in inelastic electron - nucleus scattering , where the mt is negligible , does not lead to any final state . on the other hand , at small momentum transfers , such as in electron - positron we calculate the cross sections of the @xmath0 annihilation into the two - pion final states in the vector dominance model ( vdm ) and nonrelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we use the relativistic hadronization model ( rhom ) to calculate the wavefunctions of the three - quark proton , the pion , and the kaon in the final states . at small momentum transfers , we compare the predictions of vdm with those of the knockout process and find that they are in good agreement . <n> pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 13.75.cs , 14.40.gx collisions of leptons and hadrons have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically . in particular , in the heavy - ion collision at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , experimental measurements of the total cross section of electron - positron knockout @xcite and the differential distributions of lepton - pair creation in electron - proton collisions have been reported . however , it is well - known that the knockout cross section is not a simple linear function of the collision energy , we present a model for the quark - antiquark ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) knockout process based on the relativistic hadron resonance model ( rhom ) .<n> the model reproduces the empirical hadron magnetic form factor up to the order of 100 gev , and predicts a new type of hadronic resonances , namely , quarkonium - like states . in these states ,<n> the quarks form bound states with their antiquarks below the threshold for the production of high energy hadrons . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) are among the most powerful tools for the investigation of strong interaction physics at high energy densities . at rhic energies , the collision of two or more nuclei can be viewed as a strong interaction , characterized by a high energy cut - off , which can be well described by a relativistic model @xcite . the relativistic model ( rm ) for the strong interaction has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems , including heavy - ion collision (hic ) physics , neutrino physics and cosmology . however , there are still many open questions , such as , for example , we derive the overlap integrals for the @xmath0 and @xcite e.m . <n> currents in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd .<n> we show that the magnetic part of the currents is in general the dominant one , while the electric part depends on the gauge invariance of the wavefunctions of the struck quarks . as an application<n> , we study the @ x(1 ) knockout process in the presence of the electromagnetic currents and find that it can be described by the same formalism as in the nrqm model . *<n> introduction : * in the standard model ( sm ) , the electromagnetic ( em ) currents are given by the breit - wigner amplitudes . in relativistic models ,<n> the em currents arise from the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equation of state ( eos ) with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) lagrangian , which in turn is defined by the relativistic dirac equation ( rdem ) @x<n> . however , in the case of relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( rqcd ) ( see e.g we study the cross sections of the @xmath0 reactions , i.e. , the knockout process and the virtual - photon - exchange ( vdm ) process , within an effective lagrangian approach .<n> in particular , we focus on the effects of the form factors of the proton wavefunction , which are directly related to the strangeness coefficients of the nucleon . as a result ,<n> we find that _ at small values of the momentum transfer , _ the cross section of the knockout is comparable to the vdm one _ and exceeds even the relativistic heavy - ion collision ( rhom ) prediction . <n> we also find that the cross - sections of @xcite and @x <n>  dalitz plot '' ( dlr ) are very sensitive to the coefficients of proton s strangeness wavefunctions . for instance , in the case of the pion electroproduction ( eup ) , it is well known that the rms radius of the produced pion is larger than that of the rho meson , so that it is called as the strange quark ( sq ) effect . in this paper<n>  using the spin - flavor wavefunction of the @xmath0 clusters , we find that the strange quark condensates in the bag are very small .<n> we estimate the coefficients of the color exchange terms between the quarks in the core and the cloud as a function of the bag radius , and find that they are of the order of the strangeness fraction of the proton . <n> it has been a long - standing problem whether or not there are light quark - antiquark bound states in the universe , i.e. , if there are no light quarks . recently , there has been some progress in the understanding of the light - quark bound states @xcite . in particular<n> , it was found that the masses and the widths of these states are consistent with the lattice qcd results . on the other hand ,<n> it was also found that there are bound states that are not light enough for the standard model ( sm ) to describe the observed masses and widths ; these states have to be heavier than the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) which has a mass of about 1 gev . as a result , these states should be considered as the missing link in the we re - estimated the @xmath0 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xcite . our calculation is based on the relativistic hadron model ( rhom ) which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction .<n> first , we confirmed the results of ref . <n> [ phys . rev<n> . lett . * 95 * , 070404 ( 2005 ) ] for the @ x - ray knockout process in nrqm , and then we extended the calculation to the study of the nucleon form factors and their interference . we found that the cross sections of the rhom are enhanced compared with the nonrelativistic quark model ones by an order of magnitude , which is mainly due to the magnetic part of the hadron e.m . current . next ,<n> we improved the model predictions by taking the phenomenological rhom which is successful in describing the form factors in a wide range of the quark mass . in this model<n> we find that assuming only 35% admixture of the strange quarks in the proton can give a similar size of the cross section for @x we study the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in elastic @xmath0 electroproduction using the overlap integral formalism and the cloudy bag model .<n> we calculate the differential cross section of the process and find that it is dominated by the diffractive part . <n> the recent measurement of @xcite by the lhcb collaboration of the inclusive cross section for the process of electroproduction of the charged higgs boson @x , @x,@xmath1 , in proton - proton collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 7 tev is a striking achievement in hadron physics . in the present paper , we perform a similar study on the vector - pseudoscalar ( v - ps ) mesons , which are the vector partners of the pseudoscalars in the scalar - vector ( sv - sp ) channel of the electroproduction process . to obtain the cross section we use the method of overlap integrals ( rhom ) , where the overlap of the wavefunctions of the composite two - particle systems with 4-momentum is used to evaluate the overlap matrix elements . as a result<n> , the amplitude of the v -p me",

ray variability in the inner jet of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) b150958 using _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ data .<n> the variability is detected in all spectral regions of the pwn and is correlated with the variability of the outer jet , which terminates abruptly at a small clump at @xmath0 from the pulsar . <n> the spectrum of the jet -

rayet we present the results of a deep ( @xmath0ks ) chandra observation of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr j18460258 in kes 75 .<n> the deep x - ray images reveal axisymmetric structure of the pwn with jet and torus features , and the arc - like structure in the northeast is interpreted as equatorial outflow , either a toroidal termination shock or a wisp . from the spatial modeling ,<n> the arc has a radius of @xxmath1 , inclined at the position of the symmetry axis at a position angle @x.2@xmath2 , which is consistent with the equatorial torus interpretation . also , the spectrum of the northern clump can be well - modeled by an absorbed power - law with a photon index of 2 , similar to the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood . in the quiescent state<n> , we measure a pulsar luminosity of @ xmath3 ergs s@xcite , corresponding to a surface magnetic field strength of 2 g. the flux measurement for the second epoch indicates a thermal emission contribution from the neutron star s magnetosphere , suggesting that the pulsar s psr j18460258 is the only known example of a supernova remnant ( pwn ) associated with a magnetar -

[ eqs ] and references therein )<n> this interaction can be described by the we consider the spontaneous emission from an atom in a cavity .<n> we show that for specific atomic positions the inhibition of spontaneous emission occurs due to the interference of the reflected wave packet with the atom . in this case<n> the spatial mode function @xmath0 for all the modes around the atomic transition frequency is reduced by a factor of two compared with the case of the atom at the cavity center . for other positions ,<n> the density of interacting modes is increased and thus the spontaneous radiation rate remains the same . <n> _ introduction _ the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) has a long history @xcite and is expected to play an important role in the future development of quantum information science . among the various proposals for the quantum information processing , one of the most promising<n> is based on the use of atoms in cavities . due to their high potential , in the past few years<n> a number of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out to demonstrate the possibility of using an atomic ensemble in cavities for the purpose of quantum computation , quantum teleportation , and quantum feedback control . however , the feasibility of using atoms in cavity is still an open question . here , we show we analyze the dynamics of a single excited atom in an optical cavity .<n> we show that the spontaneous emission of the atom can be suppressed or enhanced depending on the spatial distribution of the atoms and the initial excitation state . <n> the cavity qed system with trapped atoms @xcite represents a quite new experimental system . in this system<n> the excitation of a particular atom is mediated by the cavity field , and the radiation is emitted in the vacuum field . however , due to the presence of the cavity , the atomic decay is influenced only by the initial state and is not directly accessible to the measurement apparatus . as a result ,<n> the radiation can not be completely captured in the cavity and can be either enhanced or suppressed . here<n> we analyze this problem for a specific initial condition when the initially excited atom is surrounded by a collection of @xmath0 two - level atoms in the ground state , which can be considered as a  linear  crystal '' . by changing the density of the atomic system we can model systems such as atomic structures embedded in optical lattices ( for example , in dielectrics ) or optical microcavities . from a theoretical point of view<n> this represents a rather specific we study the dynamics of an atomic ensemble in a cavity qed setup .<n> it is shown that the excitations of the atomic system can be mapped to the spectrum of the cavity modes . in particular , the spectrum undergoes a gradual narrowing from a broad flat spectrum towards a lorentzian -

stationary shape , being very close to the corresponding ( larentzian ) emission spectrum usually associated with the free - space emission . <n> 2 the concept of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite has opened a new branch of research in the field of cavity optomechanics , which is based on the interaction of a cavity field with a quantum system . among other things ,<n> cavity - qed has attracted a lot of interest because of its potential application in quantum information processing . on the other hand , it is also known to be sensitive to decoherence processes in the cavity field , for example , due to the so - called back - action of the field on the quantum we propose and analyze a scheme for the experimental realization of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) many - mode cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .<n> the proposed setup is based on the interaction of a single atom decaying in a dielectric medium with the field modes of a high -

particle _ case , where the dynamics is given in terms of the hamiltonian of the system of interest . however , there are a number of _ interacting _ many - particle systems , for which exact expressions for the dynamics are not available . as such , it is natural to ask how one can reconstruct the master equation which governs the time evolution of a _<n> composite we present a microscopic model of the cavity qed describing an atom interacting with multimode electromagnetic field . we have shown how the decay of the atom is modified due to the mode structure of the field and the presence of neighboring atoms .<n> the model allows us to formulate the quantum version of the extinction theorem which on the classical level explains how electromagnetic wave packets propagate in material media . <n> [ [ section ] ] the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite is one of the most important tools for the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic fields . in recent years<n> it has been successfully applied to a variety of problems , ranging from cavity qcd like description of the internal structure of atoms , to quantum information processing with photons and electrons , and to cavity opto - mechanical systems . however , in spite of its importance , qed has not been able to describe in a comprehensive way the interaction of an atom with the electromagnetic field in a real physical system . at the same time<n> , there are a number of interesting applications in quantum optics , such as the description of atoms in dielectrics , or the trapping of ions in optical potential . here<n> we consider a microscopic we consider the interaction of an atom with an electromagnetic field in a cavity .<n> the interaction is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where the  atom '' is assumed to be in its ground state , and the electromagnetic field is given by the schrdinger equation . in the limit of a weak coupling between the atom and the field<n> we recover the well -

equilibrium statistical mechanics . in the non - ergodic case ,<n> the behavior of a system is determined by the coupling to the environment , which in turn depends on the state of the system and on the parameters of the model @xcite . for the case of a non - interacting system , the steady - state ( ss ) solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( td )<n> is given by the solution of a linear sd equation ( lse ) , known as the  in this paper , we derive lower and upper bounds on the error probability for estimating the unknown parameters of a quantum system that is subject to additive white gaussian noise .<n> the results are valid for both noiseless and noisy systems . <n> estimation of parameters in quantum systems is of great interest in many areas of quantum information science and technology . in the field of quantum metrology ,<n> the estimation of unknown parameters is one of the most important problems @xcite . due to the difficulty in performing this task in general , and in particular in noisy systems<n> , there has been a considerable amount of work on the subject of estimating parameters in noiseless quantum systems , which are known as noiseless systems ( nls ) . however , it is well - known that estimation in the presence of additive noise is np - hard , if not impossible , even for the most general class of noiseless system . on the other hand , in the case of noise - free systems<n> it is possible to estimate parameters with arbitrarily small error probability , provided that the noise is sufficiently weak . for this reason , the theoretical analysis of the estimation problem of noise free systems has a long history @x in this paper , we propose a new method for estimating the weighted mean and variance of generating functions of a system .<n> the method is based on the concept of typical set estimator , which is a generalization of the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) estimator . <n> let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional hilbert space and let the system be a _<n> noisy _ , i.e. , a system of _ many _ independent , identically distributed , probability - valued variables , each of which is subject to some _ typical noise_. in this work ,<n> we consider the following problem : given a system consisting of a finite number of independent _ binary _ tuples , estimate the _ mean _ and _ variance _ of the weighted sum of their generating functions . here<n> , the mean and the variance are given as functions of the parameters of the system , while the variance is given as a function of these parameters . in the literature , it is well known that , for _ symmetric _ systems , such as the symmetric brownian motion , in this paper , we present a new method for estimating the noise in quantum state estimation .<n> the method is based on the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( k - am ) principle , which states that a quantum system can be estimated if and only if its state is a typical ( maximally entangled ) state . in order to estimate the quantum state ,<n> the estimator first needs to determine the set of states that are most likely to be the final state of the quantum system , and then , under the assumption that this set is known , the estimator gives a correct estimate of the state of this set . <n> quantum estimation is one of the most important problems in modern physics , where the challenge is to find a method that is both accurate and efficient at the expense of computational cost . to this end<n> , there has been a lot of work done on quantum estimation , both in theory and in practice ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the most common method for estimation of a quantum state is to use the von neumann entropy @xmath0 as a measure of the uncertainty in the initial quantum state ( see also @ in this paper , we show that the error probability of an error correction scheme based on a discrete memoryless source can be bounded from above by a constant independent of the dimension of the memoryless system .<n> this result can be used to obtain an upper bound on the error correction rate for a class of error - correcting codes . <n> error correction codes , memoryless systems , group testing error correction schemes are widely used in various fields of science and engineering , such as biology , chemistry , physics , computer science , and mathematics @xcite . in most of these schemes ,<n> the source of error is assumed to be a noisy system , i.e. , a set of @xmath0 independent random variables , each of which is used to produce the output of a test function . for an error - correction scheme that is based on group testing , the input of the test function<n> is the result of some logical operation ( logical or in the above cases ) , which is chosen according to the setting of the conventional group testing and is called _<n> noiseless system_. in general , there are two classes of noiseless systems that can be treated as noiseless  the direct part theorem is generalized to the case of generalized noiseless systems .<n> it is shown that for any pair of @xmath0-pooling graphs , the error probability can be expressed in terms of the entropy function of the corresponding dms . as an application<n> , we derive a lower bound for the estimation error probability of a binary group testing problem . <n> estimation of unknown parameters in a quantum system is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory @xcite . in this problem ,<n> the estimation of the unknown parameters is carried out by the so - called _ generator functions _ of the quantum system , which are functions of the system s state . to estimate the parameters , one needs to know the _ input _ and _ output _ values of the generator functions as well as their _ expectation _<n> values . for a given input value , it is natural to expect that the output value is the same for all input values except for a small number of input values , called type values : these are the values of _ conjugate variables _ ( cvs ) of the input and output variables , respectively . the problem of estimating the we derive a class of noiseless quantum systems in which the error probability is bounded from above by a constant that depends only on the system parameters .<n> this class contains all noiseless systems that can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is a generalization of the well - known einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) system . in this paper<n> , we show that this class of systems can be used to describe a variety of quantum information processing ( qip ) protocols , such as entanglement swapping , quantum teleportation , and quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . <n> quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite is a powerful technique for reducing the errors in the output of a quantum bit ( qubit ) to a small number of inputs , called the output probability . for a qubit encoded in a two - level system ( tls )<n> it is well known that the error between the output and the input can be reduced by a factor of two , known as the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( k - amm ) error correction . on the other hand ,<n> the in this paper , we prove lower bounds on the estimation error probability for a group testing scheme .<n> these bounds imply that a sparse pooling graph or pooling matrix is required for asymptotically optimal reconstruction . from an information - theoretic point of view , these results can be used as a benchmark for the combination of a code and a decoding algorithm , such as belief propagation , and can stimulate the development of novel reconstruction algorithms . <n> asymptotic bounds , group testing , linear error correction , ldpc codes . in this paper , we present a new method for the generation of a sequence of pulses in a pulse generator .<n> the method is based on a generalization of the time - frequency locking technique introduced in @xcite , which has been used to generate sequences of pulses for decades . in this method ,<n> a pulse is generated with a certain frequency and the output of the pulse is read by a computer . for a given pulse<n> , the computer determines the value of the parameters of the input pulse , in such a way that the output pulse is precisely controlled . <n> the main purpose of this paper is to show that this method can be used for generating sequences of pulse pulses with a desired sequence of durations , and with desired pulse shape . as an example , for a pulse with duration of @xmath0 s we show that it is possible to generate a sequence in which the duration of the pulses is of the order of @<n> 10 ns . moreover , it is shown that this sequence can be controlled by the time derivative of the control field , rather than by the pulse width alone . to generate this sequence , a pulse<n> is generated by a single controlled field and the control",

dependent mass .<n> we derive compact expression of 2-susy pairs @xmath0 in terms of second order superpotential and the mass function . a detailed analysis has been given about zero mode equations of first and second order supercharges and possible reduction of ss scheme to first order susy . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of superconductivity @xcite , one of the most active areas in the study of condensed matter physics is related to the problem of identifying the ground state and low - lying excited states of the system . in the case of superconductors<n> , it is well known that the wave functions and energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonians can be calculated by the born - markov approximation ( bma ) , which is based on the diagonalization of the schrdinger equation of the superconductor . on the other hand , in the field of strongly correlated systems , such as superfluids and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) it is necessary to take into account the effects of the interactions between the constituents . as in this work we generalize the concept of si condition for ssusy scheme to the second order susy approach for em hamiltonians .<n> we obtain wave functions and energy eigenvalues for @xmath0-th order schrdinger hamiltonian , which is a generalization of the method used in ref . <n> @xcite . as an application<n> , we consider a one -

state energy remains finite for all values of the barrier strength , while for repulsive ( attractive ) barrier the energy is finite only for values of barrier strength below a certain critical value , below which the 1d ground state is penetrable by the quantum -

scale structure of universe star formation in galaxies the ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity function of galaxies is an excellent diagnostic of the state of the igm at the epoch when it was first formed . at that epoch , the star formation rate ( sfr ) in a galaxy is determined by the mass of the dark matter halo in which the star was formed , and it is proportional to the square of the mass in units of the critical mass for star formation which is a function of the halo s virial temperature . for a given halo mass , this ratio is a decreasing function of time , as the gas cools more rapidly and the stars we study the properties of high redshift ( @xmath0 ) lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models using different mass functions .<n> we find that the observed abundance of rare high mass collapsed halos at high red shifts can not be explained in terms of cdm models with standard cosmological parameters . instead<n> , we suggest that these objects are formed in molecular cooled halos with a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) and have a reionization history similar to that of the local objects . in order to explain the observed uv luminosity function , the mass of these objects has to be lower than that of local objects at all redshifts . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory large - scale structure of universe galaxies : formation , evolution quasars : absorption lines , emission lines the uv - continuum luminosity function ( lf ) of high - redshift galaxies has been measured to be consistent with the results from numerical simulations @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite for a review of numerical simulations of structure formation in the concordance cdm model ) as well as observations . however , we use the sasaki formalism to predict the number density of halos as a function of redshift , for a wide range of cosmological models .<n> we find that , in general , the predicted number density at given redshift is lower than the observed number density in the range of @xmath0 , indicating a lower net formation rate . in order to match the observed luminosity function of lbgs , we use different mass functions , derived from cosmological n - body simulations , that span a range of luminosity , redshift and mass . using the most recent measurements of the luminosity function at different redshifts ,<n> we show that the mass functions predicted by the different mass models are in reasonable agreement with each other , but that they disagree in some cases , suggesting the need for further work on constraining the form of the halo mass function . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation cosmology : theory large - scale structure of the universe galaxies , clusters : general quasars : absorption - line systems . we present models of the luminosity function ( lf ) of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .<n> we fit the observed lf in the redshift range @xmath0 = 0.1 to 2 using two different mass functions : a power law ( ps ) mass function and a mass function given by the sheth & tormen ( st ) model . for the ps mass function<n> we find that the best fit to the data is obtained with a mass of the order of 10@xmath1 and a characteristic mass scale of 10 - 50 times the eddington luminosity . on the other hand for the st mass function , we find a better fit with a lower mass and a larger characteristic scale . in order to fit the lf at the low luminosity end we need additional feedback to suppress the star formation in low mass halos that contribute to the luminosity at this redshift . <n> the luminosity functions of type - ia ( qso ) supernova ( sn ) are one of the most powerful tools to study the physics of the early universe ( e.g. cold dark matter , quasars , supermassive black holes , etc . we present results from a study of the agn luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath0 using two different mass functions , namely the schechter function ( st ) mass function as well as the ps mass function .<n> we find that models using the st mass function provide a reasonable fit to the observed lf at all redshifts . however , the lf obtained from models that use the ssc mass function is not as good as that obtained from the models with the _ ps _ mass function<n> . we also find that the observed luminosity function does not exhibit any particular redshift evolution with redshift , in spite of the fact that models with both mass functions provide better fits to the data . <n> we present the results of our study of agn lf using two mass functions and two different observed luminosity functions . in this paper<n> we focus on two mass function models : one using the mass function recently proposed by roberts et al ( ps) , and the other using the recently proposed mass function of shapiro - akimoto - yoshida ( sa ) . using these mass functions we are able to fit the observed we study the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the redshift range @xmath0 as it is affected by the galactic outflows from galaxies in paper ii of this series .<n> we show that the metallicity floor in the igm can be as high as a factor of 10 higher than the cosmic value if the metallicities are polluted by the outflows of galaxies at the same rate as in the local universe . <n> [ firstpage ] intergalactic medium galaxies : high - redshift cosmology : theory ism : kinematics and dynamics galaxies , halos : intergalactic medium in paper ii of this series we have studied the outflows from dark matter halos in the mass range @xmath0 using the sasaki formalism . in this paper<n> , we calculate the porosity of the galactic outflows at different redshifts .<n> we find that the volume filling factor is dominated by the outflowing material in this mass range . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation cosmology : theory dark matter <n> ism : kinematics and dynamics <n> x - rays : galaxies . the formation of structure in the universe is one of the oldest questions in physics and astronomy . since the origin of the large scale structure ( lss ) ,<n> it has been understood in various frameworks , such as hierarchical structure formation ( hsf ) @xcite , gravitational instability ( gil ) in spiral galaxies , the role of feedback from supernovae ( sne ) and the chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( see e.g. ref . and references therein )<n> . however , there is no consensus as to how the structure formation is related to the overall properties of the universe . at we compare the physical properties of outflows produced by star formation and that which are injected into the intra - galactic medium ( igm ) .<n> we use the semi - analytic model of sasaki et al . , ( 2000 ) and the derivative of the chandrasekhar - fermi ( st ) mass function . in general , we find that physical properties related to the outflows , such as porosity weighted average mass , average metallicity , peculiar velocity and temperature , do not vary significantly between these models . we also find that small mass halos ( @xmath0 ) that contribute dominantly to the volume filling factor do not inject any significant amount of energy into the igm and do not create any hot bubble , due to the smaller size of the halos at high redshifts . as a result ,<n> the physical characteristics of the hot bubble predicted by all the outflow models that we have considered do not differ significantly from those predicted by the model that we use to calculate the net formation rate , even if we take into account the fact that some of these models predict higher average halo mass than that of the dark matter halos that contribute to the filling factor . we use the semi - analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies developed in paper i and ii , to calculate the observed uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies at @xmath0 and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .<n> we find that the model predictions are insensitive to the manner in which the net formation rate of high mass dark matter halos is computed , provided one uses the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function , the sasaki formalism for calculating the net halo formation rate , or the derivative of the ps mass function<n> . we also present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass functions . <n> # 1_#1 _ # 1@xmath1 # 1equation ( [ # 1 ] ) # 1figure [ fig:#1 ] we show that the method used to calculate the formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos has only a mild effect on the predictions of high redshift uv luminosity functions .<n> different models give similar predictions for other physical parameters associated with outflows and the conclusions of paper ii are largely insensitive to the adopted form of the halo mass function . in order to produce a given electron optical depth to the reionization , the efficiency in the star formation and/or in uv escape fraction has to be lower in the models using st and other mass functions obtained from simulations compared to that with the ps mass function @xcite . this decreases<n> , however , in the small mass molecular cooled halos if they also contribute to the radiative transfer process . we present the results of a gravitational wave ( gw ) detection of the black hole ( bh ) binary cygnus x-1 at a redshift of @xmath0 .<n> the gw signal was detected in the gravitational wave detector array ( gwa ) at a wavelength of 6 cm , with a detection sensitivity of about 10 microhertz ( hz ) . <n> cyg x-1 is an ultra - compact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) with a mass of about 2 and a half solar mass , located in the perseus cluster at a distance of about 300 pc . at this distance ,<n> the spectrum is dominated by emission lines from highly ionized hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) and helium ( he ) associated with a kinematically cold ( t = 10 k ) extended component , which is seen as a broad peak in the optical / near - ir spectra . the source was discovered in a search for gws at redshifts @xcite , and subsequently confirmed by the _ einstein _ and _ fermi _ interferometers ( iacts ) in the nir . we show that , in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) , the baryonic matter content of the universe , and the shape of the spectrum of primordial density perturbations .<n> we also show that this correspondence can be used to predict the spectral index of the primordial fluctuation spectrum . <n> the observational properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide strong evidence for the existence of a large scale structure in the form of a dark energy ( de ) component , which dominates the energy density of the observable universe at high redshifts @xcite . in the framework of general relativity ( gr )<n> , it is generally assumed that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at all times . on the other hand , theories of quantum gravity ( qg ) and the standard cosmological model ( sm ) predict that the present - day universe is dominated by a cosmological constant ( cdm ) with the properties of a perfect fluid , dark matter ( dm ) or both<n> . however , both theories fail to explain the origin of the observed flatness of the we report on the observation of a binary x - ray transient source ( xrbs ) in the vicinity of the galactic center .<n> the source was detected by the _ swift _ xrt with a peak flux of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 @xcite . <n> the xrb was located at a projected angular distance of 0.23 arcmin from the center of the galaxy , with a transverse velocity of -70 km / s , and was elongated with respect to the line of sight of the xrt . the source spectrum was well described by a power - law with a photon index of -0.8 , which was consistent with a previous determination of the source s mass , reddening and distance from the galactic plane .",

dimensional lattice gas of noninteracting point - like particles .<n> the particles are allowed to move freely on the lattice , but at the same time may be subjected to a temporal counter that records the number of time steps crossed by the particle . in the absence of a particle counter ,<n> the particle dynamics is described by a langevin equation . when a particle is brought into contact with a lattice site , the particle senses the value of the last particle that has visited the site . if the difference between the particle counter and the value sensed at the site is strictly positive , an exchange of information between particle and lattice site takes place . <n> the dynamics of a quantum particle interacting with a thermal bath is described in terms of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is a special case of the poisson s equation , and can be solved exactly in the limit when the bath temperature is zero . for a classical point particle , that is , a particle that moves freely on a lattice<n> , there is an interaction that takes place when the particle is at the lattice or when it is at rest in the thermal bath . the interaction is represented by @x a discrete - valued model of self - interference is proposed .<n> it is shown that this model is in perfect agreement with quantum mechanics ( qm ) for a number of increasingly complex scenarios . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.bz , 11.10.lm , 12.20.ds , 13.40.gp , 14.20.dh in this paper , we propose a new model of particle emission , based on the idea that particles can not be emitted from a single site of a lattice , but rather , particles can be emitted in series from different sites . in this model ,<n> particles are treated as point - like sources , and the interaction with the lattice is treated as a source - sink interaction . as a result , the interaction between the particles is described by a hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is discrete and has a discrete value , as well as a discrete momentum , in addition to the momentum of the particles . for a given value of the discrete - value parameter ,  particles '' can be identified by their  momentum '' , i.e. , by the probability of emission from a particular site , @ a new quantum mechanical model is proposed , in which a particle is prepared at a site with infinitely many equally - probable and equally - spaced bosonic sources separated by a distance @xmath0 in lattice units .<n> the particle is submitted to external forces as soon as it hits one of the boundaries of the ring . in this scenario ,<n> the steady - state particle momentum distribution is calculated , as well as the momentum distribution of all bosons possessed . due to the latter change<n> , the particle can interfere with its previous paths through creation of bosons . <n> it is shown that the proposed model is in perfect agreement with qm predictions , derived in the appendix [ app : ring ] , after transformation to lattice units<n> . then the model is applied to the problem of a particle in a box \" , where the particle has no interactions with the environment , and the boundary of the box is replaced by a ring of finite size . as a result , there are infinitely many possible particle paths interefere , with a path difference that is always a multiple of the distance between sources . for simplicity , only bosonic and fermionic sources<n> are considered , so that a model for self - interference is proposed , which can be implemented numerically in a wide range of physical situations .<n> it is based on the observation that the interference pattern builds up when a large number of particles are emitted from a single site , and it is caused by the interference between successive particle emissions . in the proposed model ,<n> the number of particle emissions is the only free parameter . as a result<n> , the model can be used to simulate many physical scenarios . <n> the observation of interference patterns in quantum mechanics ( qm ) experiments has been a long - standing goal in theoretical physics . since the pioneering works of feynman @xcite and bohr @xmath0 in the 1950 s , it has been recognized that qm experiments may provide a powerful tool for the study of quantum many - body systems . among the many results that have been achieved , there are the measurement of the mass of the higgs boson by monte carlo simulations of the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @x<n> . however , this is only the first step in the construction of a qm experiment . to date , experimental evidence for the existence of a non - zero mass quantum mechanics ( qm ) is the cornerstone of modern physics .<n> however , it is far from being a complete theory , as many of its predictions are not satisfied by experiment . in this paper<n> , we propose a new model of qm based on an ontology of similarly - prepared particles , which is capable of explaining several quantum phenomena , such as quantum interference , large @xmath0 scaling , and particle creation and annihilation , in a simple and _ quantitative _ way . <n> quantum mechanics is the most successful physical theory of all time , both in terms of its achievements and its limitations @xcite . yet ,<n> despite its success , qm lacks a complete and quantitative theory . to this end , several attempts have been made in recent years to extend qm to the realm of _ non - classical _ phenomena . among them<n> are the emergent theories of general relativity ( gr ) , superconductivity ( sc ) and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @x , to name a few . for each of these phenomena<n> there has been a corresponding theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) or of we propose a lattice gas model for single - photon interference which is invariant with respect to lorentz transformations .<n> the model describes the interference of two beams of photons , each of which is incident on the same side of a double - slit experiment . in the proposed model ,<n> the frequency is retrieved as the reciprocal of the _ average return time _ to any position of the lattice . as a consequence , the probability mass function @xmath0 is a gaussian distribution , whose form is determined by the parameters of the model : the intensity of the incident beam and the intensity ratio between the two beams . <n> the single - beam interference phenomenon @xcite , in which two beams are separated by a finite distance , is one of the most important phenomena in the field of quantum optics . since the first proposal by de raedt and michielsen ( 2010 ) , this phenomenon has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies . among them , a great deal of work has been devoted to the derivation of the so - called _ interference theorem _ , which states that the interference between two beams can not be reduced to a single beam interference . in this letter , i propose a new approach to the study of topological properties of spacetimes .<n> this approach is based on the concept of a fundamental lattice , which is the set of points in spacetime that can be reached by an experimenter s particle . for a particle moving in the spacetime ,<n> i show that the probability of finding the particle at a site of the fundamental lattice is proportional to the square of the particle s momentum propensity . as a result<n> , the probability density can be expressed as a convolution of the probability densities of particle positions and velocities in the reference frame that the particle is moving with respect to , say , a moving reference frame . using this approach , it is possible to calculate the schrdinger s equation for the probability mass function of a particle that is moving in a spacetime whose fundamental lattice has dimension @xmath0 . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the theoretical and experimental study of the properties of topological phases of matter @xcite . in particular , in the context of condensed matter physics , one of the most important questions is the relation between topological properties and the dynamics of the system under investigation . to answer the particle in a ring \" scenario is generalized to include the presence of two sources that are equally probable . in this scenario ,<n> the particle is confined in a finite region and the wavefunction is a superposition of two exponentials , one of which is a plane wave .<n> the phase difference between the waveforms is related to the particle s interference with respect to the two sources . for a particle of mass @xmath0<n> , it is shown that the interference term is proportional to the square root of the wavenumber squared , and is independent of the number of sources in the ring , i.e. , of the size of the ring and of the frequency with which the particles are emitted . as a result , the particle can be described by a single plane wave of a well - defined wavenumber and momentum , even if the sources are equally spaced by a distance of the order of the particle radius . <n> particle - in - a - ring ( pic ) is one of the simplest scenarios in quantum mechanics , as it is the only one that allows the particle to be confined to a finite area and to propagate freely in the bulk of a medium , without being detected . we present a statistical model of particle production in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .<n> the model is based on the concept of ergodicity , which states that the probability to find a new boson at a particular site , relative to the probability of finding all other bosons there , is equal to the product of the lifetimes of the resident bosons at that site and the new boson . as a result<n> , the number of new bosons produced per second in a bec can be calculated as @xmath0 . <n> the production of bose condensates of ultrarelativistic heavy bosons is of fundamental and practical interest @xcite . in particular ,<n> the study of their properties , such as their masses , chemical potentials , momenta , etc . is of great importance for understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and for predicting the properties of new particles that appear in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) such as supersymmetry ( susy ) or extra dimensions . the experimental observation of the bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of ultracold neutral atomic bosons has been one of the main achievements in the field we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .<n> we show that the temperature dependence of the condensate - bec transition temperature @xmath0 can be well described by a power - law distribution of the fluctuation amplitudes , which is in agreement with recent experimental results . <n> we find that the transition temperature of the bec can be significantly increased by thermal fluctuations , and that the critical temperature for the phase transition between the spin-1 condensate and the spin-0 condensate is strongly dependent on the value of the temperature . in particular , the transition is first - order when the temperature is increased from zero to a finite value .",

based control of the absorption spectrum , which has been demonstrated in a number of systems@xmath0 . here , we show how to use the eit control method to control extinction spectrum by changing the powers @xmath1 of two orthogonal ( super- , sub-)radiant dipoles  the fano effect is a ubiquitous phenomenon in photonic crystals .<n> it manifests itself in fano resonances of photonic crystals in the presence of near - field couplings . here<n> , we report the observation of the asymmetric fano dip in the spectra of the coupled dipoles of double - fano - resonant photonic crystal ( dsrr ) , a prototype photonic crystal with an extremely high quality factor ( q ) and low material loss . by measuring the spectral properties of the isolated dipoles ,<n> we show that the coupling of the subradiant oscillator of the photonic crystal to the common narrow oscillator in dsr gives rise to the characteristic fano dips in the spectrum of the single isolated dipole , while the dipoles in the tripod plasmonic resonances couple coherently with the common oscillator . <n> photonic crystals ( pcs ) are widely used for photonic quantum information processing @xcite , quantum simulation of quantum many - body systems , and quantum metrology . in these applications , the quality factor @xmath0 of photonic crystal as a function of material loss is of great importance , as it quantifies the robustness of pcs against material losses . for a perfect realization of quantum information we study theoretically double fano resonances in tripod plasmonic resonances .<n> we find that the phase evolutions of superradiant and subradiant modes are correlated in a way determined by the relative spectral positions of the superradiants with respect to the subradiants , and the destructive interference between them can be observed even in the presence of near - field couplings between the dipole oscillators and the plasmon resonances of the tripod structure . <n> plasmic resonances are ubiquitous in nature and technology@xcite , being responsible for a wide range of phenomena , ranging from the refraction of light at optical wavelengths to the excitation of light - matter interaction at the nanoscale . in recent years<n> , plasmeonics has emerged as a powerful platform for the study of the interplay between light and matter , in particular in the context of nanophotonics , where it has been demonstrated that the coupling of light to matter can lead to a variety of effects , including the generation of non - classical states of light and the observation of novel phenomena such as the super - radiant effect . among others , it is now well known that light can be used to control the motion of charge carriers in in a double fano resonance , the phases of two dipoles are not independent of each other since a common subradiant dipole is also coupled to both dipoles .<n> we find that the phase of a common fano dipole is strongly affected by the presence of the other dipole , and can be recovered back to its original value only in the limit of a single resonance . in this paper , we study the extinction spectra of two coupled dipoles in the fano regime , which are found to be very similar to each other , even though they are coupled to two different fano poles . <n> the two - pole fano ( fdf ) resonance is one of the most fundamental fano phenomena , occurring in a wide variety of physical systems , such as photonic crystals , superconductors , @xmath0-@xmath1 junctions , josephson junction arrays , superconducting circuits , etc . @xcite in a fano system ,<n> a single dipole is coupled to its two nearest neighbors , namely , a superradiant and a normal fano , whose phases are separated by an energy gap of order of the inverse of the distance between the dipoles @ we report on the excitation of subradiant modes in a metamaterial system consisting of a dielectric slab ( dsrr ) and a free - standing circular mirror ( frr ) .<n> we show that a near - field electric field , @xmath0 , of mm@xmath1 induces dipolar excitation in dsr , and dipole excitation of frr in the composite system . as a result ,<n> the frequency of a fano dip in the spectrum of dsarr is shifted to the higher end of the frequency range , 1.6thz to 1.8thz . <n> plamonic excitations in metamaterials have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been shown that in tripod metamaterials , plamonics can be achieved by placing an array of josephson junctions ( jjs ) in the middle of a planar metamaterial , such as dielectric slabs ( mms ) or free standing circular mirrors ( frrs ) ( fig . [ fig : ring ] ) @x<n> . moreover , the study of coupled - fano resonances , i.e. , coupling of two by embedding four - rod resonators inside double - split ring resonators superlattice , a composite metamaterial system is introduced , where a common subradiant oscillator in four - rods is coupled with two superradiant resonators ( dsrrs ) to give rise to double fano resonances . as a classical analogue of four - level tripod atomic system , the extinction spectrum of the composite metamaterials exhibits a coherent effect .<n> double fana resonances are correlated owing to the conjugation of two coupling strengths @xmath0 and @xcite , which shows up as a transfer of absorbed power from one superradiants to the other superradints in frr . in recent years , plasmonic resonances in metamaterials have attracted a lot of attention , owing to their potential applications in sensing , ultrafast lasers , and quantum information processing . <n> plasmon - polariton resonances ( frrs ) in metamaterial structures are multipolar excitations in which the electric field is perpendicular to the plane of metamaterial . for example , frr is the dominant excitation mode in the plasmodynamic resonance ( plr ) of a metamaterial with @x we study the properties of three - dimensional plasmonic nanostructures with multiple fano resonances .<n> we find that the coupling between the electric and magnetic plasmon modes of the nanostructures can be used to induce transparency even in the absence of any other electromagnetically induced transparency , which is useful for sensing applications . <n> the ability to control light - matter interactions in nanostructures has been the focus of intense research efforts in recent years . among the various schemes ,<n> the one that has received the most attention is the so - called fano effect @xcite , in which the presence of an electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) results in the appearance of an electric field in the vicinity of the device , known as a fano mode ( fhm ) . in a conventional fhm device<n> , the electric field generated by the fhm is proportional to the area of the nano - structure , i.e. , it acts as a negative  screening '' field , thus making it difficult to control the electric current flowing through the structure . on the other hand , for a fhm in a metamaterial , there is an additional  damping '' field associated with the f we propose a new type of plasmonic resonance , which we call a dual - spectral plasmon - induced transparency ( dtap ) , and study its properties .<n> dtap consists of two electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) resonances , one near infrared ( ir ) and one far - infrared ( fir ) spectral region , each of which can be switched on and off by varying the amplitude and phase of the second eit resonance . in this paper , we study the properties of dtap in a split - ring metamaterial structure , where the metamaterial is made of a liquid crystal and a dielectric spacer . we find that dtap can be controlled by the spacer parameters , while the fir dtap is sensitive to the spacer properties only . <n> a metamaterial consists of an array of meta - dispersive elements , such as meta - planes , rings , fibers , rods , etc . @xcite , that are coupled to each other by electromagnetically induced transparency(emit ) ( see , e.g. , refs . 1 and 2 of this paper for a comprehensive review of this topic we investigate the properties of fano resonances in coupled plasmonic nanostructures and metamaterials .<n> we show that the characteristic asymmetric line shape is retained when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are externally driven , in agreement with gallinet s and martin s ab initio theory @xcite . in a metamaterial ,<n> the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 characterizes the sequence of constructive and destructive interferences between bright and dark plasmon resonances , while the modulation damping parameter is a measure of the decrease in fano line contrast . <n> coupling of electromagnetically induced transparency ( lspr ) to dark modes is a well - known and widely studied phenomenon in atomic and molecular physics , quantum optics , and optoelectronics .@xcite in contrast to the electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) in atomic spectroscopy , where the intrinsic non - radiative joule loss is the dominant loss mechanism , the ls pr coupling to a dark mode is much less well known and is still an open problem in many areas of physics . here<n> we will focus on the fano - like interference of plas monic resonances @x we present a theoretical study on the fano resonance line shape in the presence of a coherent coupling between a driven superradiant oscillator and a driven narrow oscillator .<n> we find that even without resorting to a plasmonic dark mode , a far - field fano - like asymmetric line shape is retained even when both oscillators are driven simultaneously . <n> _ keywords _ : superradiance , fano line shape , plasmons , photonic crystals .",

An Oxford philosophers are considering how future technology could, for instance, make a jail sentence feel as though it lasted 1,000 years, they tell Aeon magazine.

In a blog post, Roache advances an even more mind-bending idea: Some point to a future in which brain scans allow us to upload the human brain onto a computer (there's even a Wikipedia page about it). If that happens, we could perhaps \"speed up\" a prisoner's mind. \"Uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours,\" Roache writes.

world networks are far from simple , due to the ubiquitous presence of complex dynamical components , e.g. , oscillator we consider the problem of optimizing synchronization in a network of nonlinear oscillators .<n> we propose a generalized synchronization algorithm that consists of two steps : first , the oscillators are randomly arranged , and second , links between previously disconnected nodes are proposed . in each step ,<n> the number of proposed links is determined by an accept - reject algorithm , which iteratively rewires the network to optimize the system s synchronization properties . using numerical simulations<n> , we demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nonlinear systems , occurring in a wide variety of fields , including biology , chemistry , physics , computer science , engineering , sociology , etc . @xcite in this context , synchronization plays a central role , as it is the basis for many biological functions , such as gene transcription , cell division , gene regulation , immune system response , neural networks , among others . however , it is also an important problem in the real world , where networks are involved , for example , in the synchronization of electronic networks . as such , understanding and controlling synchronization in networks is important not only synchronization in complex dynamical systems is often achieved by optimally allocating oscillators and arranging them in an optimal manner .<n> however , the effect of degree assortativity on synchronization optimization is not well understood . here , we study the effects of assortative and disassortative correlation between in- and out - degrees on synchrony in two prototypical optimization problems : oscillator allocation and arrangement . in both cases ,<n> we show that positive / negative correlation between out - degree and in - degree does not imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + / [ [ keywords ]] + / + + synchrony is one of the most important concepts in modern physics , describing the ability of a complex dynamical system to synchronize itself in a consistent way @xcite . to achieve this<n> , it is essential to optimize the arrangement of oscillators in a complex network , which can be achieved by a variety of methods . among these , synchronization is a prominent example , as it has been shown to be resilient to many natural and technological disturbances , e.g. , noise @ we investigate synchronization of nonlinear oscillators on directed networks .<n> we consider two cases : ( i ) optimal synchronization in which all oscillators have the same natural frequency , and ( ii ) synchrony optimization in which each oscillator s natural frequency is rewired to optimize the synchronization of its neighbors . in both cases , we find that in - degrees play a significant role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . for the case of optimal synchronization ,<n> we observe the emergence of nodes with very large in - degree compared to the rest of the network , or hubs ; however , these results are in close agreement with our study of synchrony - optimized networks arising for the optimization problem of rearranging a set of pre - chosen frequencies on a given network . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature@xcite and plays an important role in a wide range of applications , ranging from cell biology to the brain . while synchronization has been studied for a long time , it is only recently that we have a comprehensive understanding of the role of network structure in promoting optimal synchronization properties @xcite . to this end<n> , there has been considerable interest in we study synchronization in directed oscillator networks , where each oscillator s natural frequency is associated with a network realization . in particular , we focus on the evolution of a network s properties during a process of switching the natural frequencies .<n> we find that as more switches are proposed , a rapid shift is observed in the oscillator assortativity , which quantifies the amount of oscillators that are influenced by proposed switches . <n> synchronization is a fundamental concept in physics , engineering , biology , and social sciences @xcite . over the past two decades<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the study of synchronization in various contexts , such as networks of coupled oscillators , self - organized critical systems , networks of interacting units , or systems of coupled chaotic oscillators ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs . [ eqs : corr2 , corr3 ] ) . despite this interest ,<n> there is currently no consensus on the mechanisms that underlie synchronization , despite the fact that it has been studied extensively in the context of undirected oscillator networks ( see refs<n> . for instance , @x we study the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators .<n> we derive an objective measure of synchronization , the generalized synchrony alignment function , and show that it can be used to systematically optimize the synchrony properties of networks under several constraints , including oscillator allocation , oscillator arrangement and network construction . in particular , we show that stronger synchronization is attained as the natural frequency vector becomes aligned with dominant singular vectors of the laplacian , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values . to provide further insight into the mechanisms that enhance synchronization and the role of directedness ,<n> we investigate the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization . we find a contrasting phenomenon for directed networks : after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneous of the frequency distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees . <n> pacs numbers : : 89.75.hc , 05.45.xt , 87.23.ge in recent years , there has been growing interest in the problem of optimizing the properties of complex networks , such as networks of nonlinear coupled oscillators @xcite . a central question is how to we study the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator in the presence of a periodic potential .<n> we show that the periodicity of the system can be controlled by the phase shift of the potential , which can be achieved by tuning the amplitude of the oscillation . for a fixed phase shift @xmath0<n> , we find that the system is always in a stationary state , with the periodic modulation of the amplitude and phase of the oscillations . <n> nonlinear oscillators have been studied for a long time @xcite , and a large body of work has been devoted to the study of such systems . in recent years , the interest in such systems has increased , due to the realization that they can be used to model a wide range of phenomena , from biological oscillations to the behavior of complex networks . from a theoretical point of view , it is very useful to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of nonlinear oscillations , as well as to understand their properties . on the other hand ,<n> it is also very interesting to study the properties of such a system in the nonlinear regime , since it is the simplest model of a dynamical system . to this end , in the last few years a large number of we introduce a new class of non - commutative algebras , the so - called _ hamiltonian algebras_. these algebras are derived from the hamiltonians by means of the jacobi matrix formalism .<n> we show that they possess a number of remarkable properties , among which are the following : ( i ) they can be used to describe a wide variety of physical phenomena ; ( ii ) the number of states they can capture in a given model depends on the dimension of the hilbert space in which they are embedded ; and ( iii ) there is a one - to - one correspondence between the energies of the ground and excited states of the model . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the properties of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the structure of ground states of quantum mechanical models , which are often described by _<n> hilbert spaces_.<n> this is due to the fact that these systems are typically described by a large number of _ hermitian _ operators @xmath0 , where the _ number _ of states is @x",

ictal seizure ( ps seizure ) in which the seizure onset frequency is close to @xmath0 hz , or a  seizures during seizure ( s seizures ) , where the seizure frequency is in the range of 100 - 1000 hz and is characterized by the so - called eeg frequency spectrum , which is defined as the we present an algorithm for surrogate data analysis on eeg time series at ictal and pre - ic tal states .<n> the algorithm is based on the _ autocorrelation in time series _ ( aaft ) , which provides discrimination between nonlinear and linear measures on the surrogate data , and is able to reject the null hypothesis of linear autocorrelation for the eeg and the nonlinear measures at the same time . <n> _ matlab _ is used to implement the algorithm and to visualize the measure vs resampled time series in the case of nonlinear and nonlinear measures , as well as to perform nonparametric and parametric surrogate data tests for the original time series and the surrogates . for the nonparametric surrogate data test , the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( kst )<n> is used as a criterion for rejection of the non - normality of the measure values . in order to validate the algorithm<n> , we have also run monte carlo simulations and compared the results with the theoretical predictions . * keywords : * autocorrelation , surrogate data testing , eeg , seizure , nonlinear measure , autocorrelation mismatch , nonparametric test  the authors present an interactive matlab toolkit for scalar time series analysis , matlab @xcite .<n> the strength of mats is that it can process many time series in one go , which are loaded directly from files or generated using the facilities of segmentation , standardization and resampling . in matlab<n> the user can then select among a number of measures grouped in linear , nonlinear and  other '' measures , where most of them are defined in terms of a numbers of parameters . by selecting buttons , checking boxes and specifying parameter values , the user is able to perform rather complicated tasks , e.g. , for data point search . two such tasks are demonstrated step by step , namely the computation of many measures on consecutive segments of a long time series , and the surrogate data test for nonlinearity on different time series and using different surrogate generating algorithms and test statistics . <n> _ keywords : _ matlab ; nonlinear time series we present a surrogate data test for data sets generated by nonlinear time series models .<n> the method is based on the concept of local linear prediction , which has been successfully applied to model financial time series data . as an example<n> , we apply the method to simulated data sets from gravitational wave detectors . <n> time series are one of the most powerful tools for data analysis and prediction in physics , chemistry , biology and finance . in particular ,<n> the study of gravitational waves ( gws ) is an important area of research , as they are of fundamental importance for understanding the structure of the universe and are expected to be detected by ground - based interferometers in the near future , such as the lisa gravitational wave detector @xcite , the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) @xmath0 , and the square kilometer array ( ska ) , among others . for the gw detectors , a large number of cosmological time series have been recorded during the past decades , ranging from galaxy formation rates to supernovae , chemical abundances , abundances of metals , etc . over the past few years , there has been a",

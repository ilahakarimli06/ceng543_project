Theoretically, the pseudo - particle correlation method is based on a different philosophy : instead of constructing fluctuations in fixed cells , when a collision occurs we move all together the phase space volume containing one nucleon . Theoretically, the phase space volume is not fixed a priori and depends on the location of the four points ( @xmath70 ) that have been chosen as initial and final centroids of the considered two - body collision . Theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, theoretically, as a result of this procedure, we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath106 . embodimentsthis simplified system will allow us to study the sensitivity of the results to the ingredients of the procedure used to build , step by step , the nucleon clouds . embodimentsas also discussed before , we will show that the correct fluctuation amplitude is recovered in the `` continuum limit '' , i.e. in large volumes . embodimentshowever , in the following we will mostly concentrate on the fluctuation amplitude in volumes of size @xmath98 , in order to probe the extension of the nucleon wave packet . embodimentsthe latter could influence significantly the evolution of actual nuclear collisions , where it could be important to work with more compact nucleon configurations .    using this simple model, we will find that building the maximum fluctuation value ( e.g. @xmath107 ) in such a volume , i.e. correlating particles inside @xmath103 , is a quite difficult task and additional efforts are required in order to reduce the probability of a collision . embodiments fixed grid , with increasing number of collisions ( i.e. as a function of time ) . practitionit saturates approximately when almost all nucleons have suffered one collision . in the equilibrium configuration, the fluctuations obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure . embodimentsmoreover , it further reduces for @xmath145 . embodimentsnevertheless , this smearing effect is partly compensated by the fact that the procedure used to select the cells belonging to the nucleon clouds favours compact , symmetric configurations . embodimentsit is interesting to evaluate the effect of the use of a small search cell on the fluctuations also in the general case , i.e. when the fixed grid condition is relaxed . embodimentsintuitively , we expect a small effect on the variance , as long as @xmath146 is not too small : the main reduction of fluctuations comes already from the _ centroid effect _( see previous subsection ) , which is equivalent to an infinitely small step .

no difference with the case described before ( initialization with randomly distributed test particles , section 5.3 ) , see fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ f1_rand ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\moreover , in this case the convergence between the two calculations is rather quick .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , it should be noticed that , in the geometry considered , it is not trivial to predict which is the size and

.TextColorthis underestimation indicates that in our procedure , due to the finite extension of the nucleon cloud , the regions far from the fermi surface are less involved in the building of

Neuroscientist Randal Koene has formed a nonprofit organization called Carbon Copies to promote mind uploading research. � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � Regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind, the processing demands are likely to be immense, due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron. � � � � � \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ There is ongoing work in the field of brain simulation, including partial and whole simulations of some animals. For example, the C. elegans roundworm, Drosophila fruit fly, and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees.[citation needed] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project [ edit ] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project by the Brain and Mind Institute of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project is an attempt this question.[36] Numerous scientists, including Kurzweil, strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious (with 100% confidence) is fundamentally unknowable, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see solipsism). Regardless, some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. On the contrary, numerous scientists believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate (see quantum mind).[37][38][39] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ In light of uncertainty on whether to regard uploads as conscious, Sandberg proposes a cautious approach:[40] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ If neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power, emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen. [43] [45] [46] Limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to, and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society.

In 1993, Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page, and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net. That site has not been actively updated in recent years, but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading.org, run by Randal A. Koene, who also moderates a mailing list on the topic. These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ emotions—read through their facial expressions—affects our experience of duration: time seems to pass more slowly when faced with a person expressing anger, fear, joy, or sadness.3 In addition, our experience of duration changes throughout life, with time seeming to pass more slowly for children than for adults.

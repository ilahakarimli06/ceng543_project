proton collisions using the one - photon exchange model .<n> we find that the cross section depends on the relative orbital angular momentum between the @xcite and @x <n> @xhedron clusters in the proton wavefunction , and that this dependence can be understood in terms of the effect of the proton s orbital motion on the quark and gluon propagators in the initial and final states . in particular , we show that the amplitude of the process depends on whether the initial proton is in the state with negative intrinsic parity , or not . <n> the direct production of light quarks and gluons is a fundamental process in hadron physics , which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically over the past two decades . recently ,<n> the first observation of direct photoproduction of a light quark - antiquark pair has been reported by the zeus and h1 collaborations , who observed a clear excess of events above background in the channel @x<n> s@xmath1 , with a cross section that is two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical prediction . to understand the origin of this excess , it the electroproduction of @xmath0 mesons from nucleon - nucleon collisions is investigated within the framework of the nonrelativistic quark - hadron model .<n> it is found that the cross sections of the knockout mechanism for the process are sensitive to the form of the proton wavefunction . in particular , if the wavefunction is symmetric about the center - of - mass ( cm ) , the cross section of the process is dominated by the contribution from the cluster of the bare \" proton , while the contributions from the components in the relative motion between the bare proton and the cluster are negligible . as a result ,<n> the knockout process is _ not _ a resonant process . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the process of electroproduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) from nucleons - nucleons collisions ( nn collisions ) due to the discovery of the charmonium states with mass below 2 gev in nn collision experiments @x<n> . however , it is still an open question whether these states are genuine meson states or just a part of a more complicated structure of hadrons . to answer this question , in this paper , we study the interference between the @xmath0 process and the two - photon knockout process in virtual compton scattering ( vdm ) .<n> we find that the cross section of the virtual photon - electron ( e.m . )<n> knockout process is comparable to that of the photon- electron ( p - e ) knockout process , where the former dominates at small incident electron energies , whereas the latter is dominant at large incident energies . in this case<n> , the interference of the two processes is _ not _ constructive , since it depends on the sign of the cross sections of both processes . as a result , in contrast to the vdm predictions ,<n> the interference can not be used to determine the coefficients of the proton wavefunctions , especially in the case of the p - e knockout , because of the breakdown of the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic current in the virtual process . since the discovery of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of neutral atomic nuclei @xcite , one of the most exciting phenomena in high energy physics is the possibility of the observation of superconductivity in the condensed matter @x we have calculated the cross sections of the @xmath0 annihilation into the hadronic final states in the vector dominance model ( vdm ) and the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we have compared the predictions of the two models and have found that the cross section of the knockout process in vdm is much larger than that in nqm , especially at small incident electron energies . in order to explain the experimental data , we have shown that the interference between the two knockout processes is responsible for the discrepancy between the vdm and the predictions . <n> lepton - hadron scattering is one of the fundamental processes in high energy hadron collisions , which can be used to study the structure of hadrons in the final state . due to this importance ,<n> a large number of theoretical works have been done in the past decades @xcite . among them<n> , many calculations have been carried out in the framework of the unitary time - reversal invariant quark model ( t - rtv qm)@xcite and the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method ( thdm , or td - tdm ; hereafter , vdm we present a relativistic description of the process @xmath0 based on the nrqm mechanism .<n> we show that the cross section of the knockout process is dominated by the magnetic part of the e.m . <n> current and is comparable to the vector - dominance - model ( vdm ) one at small momentum transfers . at large momentum transfers<n> , however , we find that the process is suppressed due to the strong enhancement of the electromagnetic currents . as a result ,<n> the cross sections of both processes are suppressed by several orders of magnitude . in this paper<n> we study the relativistic effects on the process , which is one of the most important topics in the field of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been under intensive investigation from both theoretical and experimental points of view . among the various predictions of the sm , it is the so - called dynamical symmetry breaking ( dsb ) , in which the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is created in the collision of two heavy ions , that has the greatest impact on the phenomen we study the cross sections of the @xmath0 reactions , i.e. , the knockout process , @xcite , and the double-@xmath1 knockout , which are sensitive to the strangeness coefficients of the proton wavefunction .<n> we find that these coefficients are very sensitive to ( i ) the form factors of the baryonic core and mesonic cloud wavefunctions and ( ii ) to the relativistic modification of form factors . as a result<n> , we predict that the cross section of the knockout is comparable to the prediction of vector - dominance - model ( vdm ) at small values of strangeness , while it is much larger than the nrqm one at large values of the strangeness . <n> we also discuss a way to extract these coefficients from an extended quark model using some results of the cloudy bag model . in recent years , a lot of theoretical and experimental works have been done to study the heavy quarkonium ( hqm ) phenomenology . among them , one of the most important is the study of the heavy - ion knockout processes , in which the knockout cross section is a sensitive probe of the quark - hadron we re - estimated the @xmath0 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xcite .<n> our calculation is based on the relativistic hartree approximation which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction . in this model we found that assuming only 35% admixture of the strange quarks in the nucleon can give a similar size of the cross sections for the@xmath1 knockout and diffractive contributions . as in nrqm ,<n> the main contribution of the amplitudes is from the magnetic part of the current , while the contribution of vector meson clusters is found to be negligible . finally , we improved the model predictions by taking the rhom which is successful in describing nucleon form factors in a wide range of @x<n> . this successful description comes from the different functional dependence of the overlap integrals , which can explain the empirical dipole - type formula of the form factors . *<n> pacs numbers : 13.60.hb , 12.38.lg , 14.40.aq * relativistic effects have been one of the central issues in particle physics for a long time , since the early days of quantum mechanics  we study the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in elastic @xmath0 electroproduction using the overlap integral formalism and the cloudy bag model .<n> we calculate the differential cross section of the process and find that it is dominated by the diffractive part . <n> the electroproduction of mesons is one of the fundamental processes in high energy physics and has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically in the past decades @xcite . in this process<n> , the photon scatters off a virtual photon in the target nucleon , producing a virtual meson in the final state . as a result of this process ,<n> the virtual pion in the nucleon will be excited and converted into a photon of another meson , which will subsequently decay into the final pion . since the experimental observation of the electro - production of the vector - meson pairs by the lhcb collaboration in 1995 , there has been a great deal of interest in the study of this phenomenon , both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . at present , it is well known that the experimental data can be well described by the v md model , in which the electromagnetic form factors",

wald procedure , it is sufficient to use the wang - landau procedure to obtain the estimated unknown parameter . as a consequence ,<n> the asymptotic behaviour of the test is determined and , in particular , the lower and upper bounds for the expected sample size are derived , as well as the asymptotic distribution of the variance of the estimated parameter , for large sample sizes . to illustrate the usefulness of the approach , two examples are given : the first one is the estimation of the parameters of the stochastic process in the presence of noise , and the second one is a monte carlo simulation of the random variable in question , where the goal is the problem of sequential detection and possible trajectory estimation of a dynamic system observed through a set of noisy radar observations is considered .<n> the transition probabilities are derived from a truncated gaussian - markov random walk model with standard deviation @xmath0 , where the design error probabilities have been adopted . <n> the behaviour of the sequential procedure has been tested through monte carlo simulations in terms of the asn and the probability of correct track estimation . in the field of radar detection and estimation @xcite , the use of phase - sensitive techniques has become a standard technique , enabling the detection of a moving target with a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , as well as the estimation of the trajectory of the target using the phase information provided by the detection . however , in many practical situations , such as radar applications , it is not possible to obtain all the information about the target trajectory from the detection process itself , and it is therefore necessary to use some prior information , for example on the target mobility . as a consequence ,<n> the performance of the detection and the estimation procedures have been heavily dependent on the choice of prior information and on the design of the radar system . the general problem of sequential detection and possible trajectory estimation of a dynamic system observed through a set of noisy measurements has been considered .<n> a thorough analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the test has been presented . in particular , it has been shown that , under rather mild conditions , the test is asymptotically optimal , in the sense that it minimizes , up to a @xmath0 term , any moment of the stopping time distribution under both hypothesis as the probabilities of error approach zero . finally , possible applications to radar surveillance problems<n> have been inspected . <n> * keywords : * dynamic systems , sequential detection , trajectory estimation , stationary distribution , stopping time , asymptotic optimality . *<n> ams subject classification :* 35r30 , 35b40 , 62m10 , 94a12 , 93b05 .

correcting codes . in the field of quantum error correction ( qec )<n> , it is well known that the best way to design a qec is to combine a code and a decoding algorithm . from an information - theoretic point of view , a good linear error correction scheme requires a sparse pooling graph or pooling matrix . on the other hand , from a practical point of views , an error -

tormen ( st ) and jenkins - white ( jw ) mass functions , on the formation rate of dark matter halos .<n> we find that the predicted net formation rate , @xmath0 , is sensitive to the assumed form of the halo mass function . in particular , we show that the st mass function predicts a net formation of halos at a redshift of about three times lower than that predicted by the jw mass function at the typical halo masses that will be detected as galaxies . on the other hand ,<n> the predictions from the ps and st mass functions are very close to each other at the same redshift . at higher redshifts , where the formation of the first generation of galaxies is expected to be more important , the predictions for the st and ps mass functions<n> are similar . <n> we present a series of n - body simulations of the hierarchical clustering of galaxies in the @xcite cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology . using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method we generate halos with masses we present a semi - analytical model for star formation and reionization in dark matter halos .<n> the model is based on the mass function derived in paper i ( dijkstra et al . <n> 2006 ) . in this paper<n> we show how the predictions of our model depend on the choice of mass function . for typical halo masses ( @xmath0 ) that will be detected as galaxies in the near future<n> , our model predicts star formation rate ( sfr ) to be a factor of two smaller than that predicted by sasaki s formalism for the standard cdm model . at lower halo masses<n> star formation is suppressed by the radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background , which also suppresses the formation rate of halos with circular velocity smaller than the escape velocity of the uv photons from the protogalactic halos ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see e.g. fan , best , mckee & thomas 2005 )<n> . however , at higher halo masses , where the halo mass function is dominated by the agn feedback , we find that all our models predict star formation rates ( sfrs  we present models of the uv luminosity function and the reionization history of the universe , based on the semi - analytic galaxy formation model ( sasaki ) .<n> we include radiative feedback from star formation in molecular cooled halos , as well as from quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the models . in order to reproduce the observed luminosity function at @xmath0 , we find that the agn contribution to the uv emission must be as large as 20% , while the star formation contribution is as small as a few percent . at the same time the models predict a lower number density of rare high mass collapsed objects compared to the models using the ps mass function . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation cosmology : theory large - scale structure of universe . we use the observed luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at redshifts @xmath0 to constrain the mass function of dark matter halos in the universe .<n> we consider three different mass functions : the standard cdm mass function , the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function and the recently proposed sasaki formalism . for each of these mass functions<n> we calculate the number density of halos as a function of their mass and compare it to the observed number density . we find that the ps mass function provides a better fit to the data than the other two , especially at low masses . <n> we then use the lf obtained from fitting the luminosity function at different redshift bins , to determine the form of the halo mass function that best fits the data . in the framework of the standard model of structure formation ( sm ) , dark matter ( dm )<n> is expected to make a negligible contribution to the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) over the entire cosmic time . however ,<n> recent observations of high - redshift galaxies ( h@xmath1 ) @xcite , suggest that a large we study the effect of galactic outflows on the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from @xmath0 to the present .<n> outflows are assumed to be the primary means by which metals are transported from galaxies into the igm and their effect on the observed igm luminosity function ( lf ) at high redshift is investigated . we find that the observed lf can be explained reasonably well by outflows with outflow velocity of a few tens of km / s , mass in the form of supernovae ( sne ) and their contribution to the cosmic star formation rate , if the mass inflow rate into the galactic halo during the epoch of galaxy formation during this period of time is taken to be of the same order as that during the period when the universe was forming stars . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : observations intergalactic medium galaxies : evolution supernovae : general . we show that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the redshift range @xmath0 can be polluted by galactic outflows with a volume filling factor of order unity .<n> the igm polluted by outflows has a lower metallicity than that of the universe as a whole , with a value of [ z / h]@xmath1 , which is a factor of 10 lower than the cosmic metallicity at the same redshift . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory galaxies : formation intergalactic medium . we present semi - analytic models for the formation of intergalactic medium ( igm ) from the collapse of dark matter ( dm ) halos .<n> these models are based on the idea that dm halos that form at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) dominate the volume filling factor of the igm and outflows from these halos contribute dominantly to the porosity of the intergalactic medium . in the framework of these models<n> we show that the physical properties of igm outflows , such as porosity and metallicity , do not vary significantly between different models , even if the halo formation rate is changed by up to 50% . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation cosmology : theory dark matter <n> intergalactic medium galaxies , clusters : general the formation and evolution of large scale structure of the universe is one of the central problems of modern cosmology . over the last two decades<n> a great deal of effort has been devoted to understanding this process , particularly in the context of galaxy formation , which is the origin of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , and of the large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe . in a series of papers we have been developing semi - analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies that are constrained by available observations on uv luminosity function and reionization . here<n> we present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass function .<n> we first show , by comparing the derivatives of all mass functions , that the historically used press - schechter ( ps ) mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function<n> . however , all other mass functions do not differ significantly in the formation rate and survival probability of halos , and hence the ps mass function can be used successfully to predict the observed uv luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 . our models successfully explain the observed luminosity function of the lbgs at redshift @xcite and predict various effects of outflows form the galaxies on the metal enrichment of the igm . <n> we had employed the sasaki formalism to obtain the halo formation rate , but we also tested the sensitivity of the model predictions to the manner in which the net formation rate is computed . we present a @xmath0 analysis of the uv luminosity functions of galaxies from lyman break to redshifts of unity .<n> we find that the uv luminosities at high redshift are dominated by metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , while at low redshift , the contribution from outflows is negligible . in the framework of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ,<n> the net formation rate of collapsed halos is given by the mass function of cdm particles , which is a function of redshift and mass of the cdm particle . <n> we have recently presented a series of papers ( paper i ) in the series @xcite , where we have studied the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and its evolution in time , from redshift zero to the present day , using a large set of observational data , including ultraviolet ( uv ) observations from _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) region , optical observations from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) galaxy redshift survey ( g we present a new method for the determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from the observation of gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> the method is based on the observation that the wavefronts of bright , high -

induced spin - polarization transitions in the dimerized phase of the hubbard hamiltonian , as well as in the so - called dimer we study the phase diagram of the sine - gordon model on a square lattice using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .<n> we find that the system exhibits three phases : a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phase , a charge density wave ( cdw ) and a spontaneously dimerized bond order ( bow )<n> . however , the existence of the bow phase depends on the relative strength of the dipolar interactions between nearest - neighbor bonds , and the phase transition between the three phases can be either periodic ( pbc ) or open boundary conditions ( obc ) depending on the sign of the on - site dipolar interaction @xmath0 . in the pbc regime ,<n> the system is in the cdw phase ; on the other hand , in the obc regime the bow is always present . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of quantum phase transitions is one of the most important topics in modern condensed matter physics @xcite . at the heart of such transitions<n> is the nature of the order parameter , which plays a crucial role in determining the critical properties of the system . for a quantum phase transition we study the phase diagram of the frustrated @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model on a square lattice by means of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques .<n> we find that the system undergoes a first - order transition from a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phase to a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( bow ) insulating phase . in the bow phase ,<n> the long - range nature of the spin - spin correlation functions allows us to precisely locate the transition point and to estimate the critical exponents . <n> the study of quantum phase transitions is one of the most important topics in modern condensed matter physics , as they provide key insights into the nature of quantum criticality and the universality class of quantum phases of matter @xcite . among the many transitions that have been studied so far , the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a normal metal and a mott insulator ( mi ) has been the focus of intense research efforts , both theoretically and experimentally , since it is a key ingredient of the mott - hubbard insulator transition ( mhd ) we study the ground - state properties of fermionic mixtures with long - range dipolar interactions in one dimension by means of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method .<n> in particular , we focus on the so - called bond - density - wave ( bow ) phase , which is characterized by dominant bond - order in the single - particle excitation spectrum and is found to be stable over a wide range of interaction strengths . in the presence of a magnetic field ,<n> the system undergoes a first - order transition from the bow phase to an insulating state with spin density wave ( sdw ) symmetry , characterized by a spin gap of the order of the fermi energy . <n> recently , the discovery of exotic phases of matter in condensed matter physics has attracted a great deal of interest in both theoretical and experimental physics @xcite . among these exotic states , a class of spin - liquid phases<n> has attracted much attention , in particular due to their exotic properties such as topological insulators ( tis ) , superconductivity and exotic fractional quantum hall states . to date , experimental progress has been achieved in the field of cold atoms in optical lattices ( cs  we study the phase diagram of the one - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field by means of a mean - field quantum monte carlo method .<n> we find that the phase boundary between the symmetric and the broken - symmetry phase is shifted towards higher temperatures with the increase of the strength of the coupling between the system and the external field . in the symmetric phase ,<n> the phase transition is first order , while in the broken symmetry phase the transition is second order . for large enough coupling<n> , the transition becomes first order and is accompanied by a first order phase transition . <n> one of the most important problems in the study of strongly correlated quantum systems is to characterize the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a normal phase ( np ) to a symmetry - broken phase ( sm ) . to this end , it is essential to determine the critical point ( cp ) separating the np and sm phases , as well as the critical exponents characterizing the symmetry - breaking phase transition @xcite . on the one hand , this question is crucial for the understanding of the crossover between the sm and np phases . at the we consider a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate in an external magnetic field , subject to an anisotropy @xmath0 and interacting via the coulomb repulsion .<n> we study the phase diagram of the system as a function of the anisotropic coupling strength and the magnetic field by means of a mean - field approximation and a bosonization approach . in the weak coupling regime<n> , we find a phase transition between a superfluid phase and a mott insulating phase . for strong coupling ,<n> the phase transition is of the ising universality class . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in one dimension ( 1d ) systems @xcite , driven by their relevance to various fields such as condensed matter physics , statistical mechanics , and quantum information processing ( qip ) . among the many interesting phases that have been studied in 1d systems , one of the most fascinating is the mott insulator ( mi ) phase , which is characterized by a gapless bulk and a gapped boundary in the excitation spectrum . at the same time , quantum fluids ( qfs ) have",

An Oxford philosophers are considering how future technology could, for instance, make a jail sentence feel as though it lasted 1,000 years, they tell Aeon magazine. After all, there are already \"a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people’s sense of time,\" and existing interrogation scenarios tinker with lighting to prevent subjects from knowing the time, says Rebecca Roache. In a blog post, Roache advances an even more mind-bending idea: Some point to a future in which brain scans allow us to upload the human brain onto a computer (there's even a Wikipedia page about it). If that happens, we could perhaps \"speed up\" a prisoner's mind. \"Uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours,\" Roache writes. That would, she notes, \"be much cheaper for the taxpayer.\" But, she points out, \"the goal isn’t simply to imagine a bunch of futuristic punishments—the goal is to look at today’s punishments through the lens of the future.\"",

[ 44 ]<n> additionally , it is noted that some scientists believe consciousness is the consequence of some computational process which is not sufficiently detailed [ 42 ] and note that this raises questions about what emulation might be . the author proposes that [ 51 ] : (i ) there is no reason to believe that : ( ii ) no matter how long it takes for a person to be locked up in a penal system for a crime that they did not commit , once they have been locked up , they will never commit again .

chosen natural frequencies on a given networks ; and ( iii ) building a network for agiven set of natural frequencies . we also study the dynamical and topological properties of synchrony - optimized networks and find that synchronization is promoted by a strong , positive correlation between the nodal in - degrees and magnitude of the natural frequencies and comparatively little effect by the relationship between nodal out - degrees . we introduce a generalized synchrony alignment function ( saf ) for directed networks , which encodes the interplay between the local oscillator dynamics and the network structure , and can be used to optimize synchronization analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints .<n> we demonstrate the utility of the generalized sf in optimizing synchronization in directed networks for several classes of constraints : ( i ) allocation of natural frequencies ; ( ii ) arrangement of a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies given a fixed network ; and ( iii ) construction of a network for a given set of natural frequency vectors . in the case of directed networks where the oscillator coupling @xmath0 is not frustrated ,<n> we show that optimizing the order parameter @xcite is equivalent to minimizing the generalized synchronization alignment function , thus providing a framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of a directed network . specifically , the sfs encode the dynamics of the oscillators , here represented by the left singular vectors and singular values , such that the alignment of the local dynamics with the structure of the network is determined by the right singular vectors , i.e. , by the network degree distribution . <n> synchronization of oscillator we investigate synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators .<n> we show that the transition to synchronization can be abrupt even for very small coupling strength , and we derive the optimal choice of coupling function that minimizes the sum of the coupling strengths of the oscillators and the coupling between them . in the case of oscillator allocation , we develop a simple greedy algorithm to find the optimal solution and show that it outperforms a random allocation of natural frequencies . we also consider the problem of oscillator arrangement , where we propose a simple algorithm to optimize the synchronization of oscillators on a network . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature @xcite and plays an important role in a wide range of applications , ranging from biology to engineering . despite its importance ,<n> there is currently a lack of understanding of how to design synchronization protocols that are robust to variations in the underlying network structure . here<n> we address this issue by proposing a new synchronization protocol that is robust to changes in the network structure and that can be applied to both electrical and mechanical oscillators coupled to each other . using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis<n> we demonstrate that our protocol can significantly improve the performance of both electrical ( e.g. , frequency filtering ) we introduce a generalized synchronization algorithm that optimizes network synchronization properties using a rewiring scheme that is greedy . in particular , we consider the effects of assortative and disassortative degree correlations on optimal synchronization in the cases of oscillator allocation and arrangement . we find that positive / negative degree assortativity does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem .<n> we also investigate the relationship between the structural and dynamical properties of optimal synchronization . _<n> _ introduction.__synchronization is one of the most important properties of complex networks , yet its study has been hampered by the lack of general methods to optimize it . here ,<n> we present a generalized rewiring scheme , called the _ generalized _ synchronization algorithm , that is both effective and simple to implement @xcite . by optimizing a network s synchronization properties<n> , one can minimize the system s asymptotic free - energy cost , which is defined as the difference between the expected and actual performance of the system after the optimization process . to achieve this goal , a network is first rewired to minimize its free energy cost and then , after the rewiring process is complete  we investigate synchronization in networks of nonlinear oscillators .<n> we consider two cases : ( i ) normal frequencies and ( ii ) heavy - tailed frequencies , where each oscillator s natural frequency is a multiple of its own natural frequency , @xmath0 . in both cases , we find that optimizing synchrony properties of the network is related to the network s structural properties , such as the number of connections , the degree distribution , and the clustering coefficient . <n> synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural and social systems , ranging from the brain to the internet @xcite . despite its ubiquity ,<n> there is currently no consensus on how synchronization is achieved in nature , despite the fact that the study of optimal synchronization has been an area of intense research for the past three decades @x<n> . one of the most important issues in this field is understanding the mechanisms that optimize synchronization properties . to this end , it is important to understand the role of structural and dynamical properties in optimizing synchronization . here , _<n><n> i.e. _ , what is the relationship between the properties of synchrony - optimized networks and those of their natural frequencies ?<n> we we develop a framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators .<n> our main theoretical result is the derivation of the generalized synchrony alignment function , which we have shown can be used to systematically optimize the synchrony properties of networks under several constraints , including oscillator allocation , oscillator arrangement , and network construction . taken together<n> , this approach does not require large - scale simulation of dynamics and is based on an objective measure of synchronization ( i.e. , a perturbation analysis of the kuramoto order parameter ) . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature @xcite and plays an important role in a wide range of applications , ranging from biology to engineering . despite its relevance ,<n> the theoretical understanding of synchronization properties in directed networks has been limited , in part due to the difficulty in formulating a general theory that can be applied to a wide variety of network topologies . in this paper , we present a general framework for optimization of the synchronizability properties of a directed network of oscillators @xmath0 . to this end , our theoretical results can be regarded as an extension to previous work that focused on the case of undirected networks we study the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator in a periodic potential with a sinusoidal frequency profile .<n> we show that the phase space is divided into two regions , a low - frequency one , in which the system is in a stationary state , and a high - frequency region , where the dynamics is chaotic and the system oscillates . in the low -frequency region<n> , the system can be described by a generalized sine - gordon equation , while in the high - frequencies region it is described by the skardal - taylor - ott equation . <n> nonlinear oscillators have been extensively studied in the context of nonlinear dynamics @xcite , as they are involved in a variety of nonlinear phenomena such as wave - particle interactions , oscillations , turbulence , chemical reactions , synchronization , etc . for example , they are used as model systems in nonlinear dynamics of chemical reactions and are also used in the study of synchronization phenomena in chemical systems . however , there is no consensus on the origin of the nonlinearity in these systems , despite the fact that they have been studied for more than a century @xmath0 . here , we will focus our attention on the behavior of",

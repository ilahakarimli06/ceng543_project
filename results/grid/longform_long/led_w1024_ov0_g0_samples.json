dependent spectrum can be given by excitation probabilities of the cavity modes [ see eq.([spec1 ] ) ] . suburthe spectrum of the cavity field is affected by the position of the atom . suburin particular , if the atom is located in the cavity center even modes are completely decoupled from the atom and only odd modes can become excited [ see eq.([lambda ] ) ] establishing in this way oscillations in the spectrum of modes . suburhowever , at the point when the total excitation energy of the atom is transferred to the field , the _ envelope _ of @xmath116 of the analyzer atoms are mutually equal and @xmath117 . isEnabledthe atomic frequencies @xmath19 are equally spaced around the transition frequency @xmath78 of the central atom . isEnabledthe atomic frequencies @xmath19 are equally spaced around the transition frequency @xmath78 of the central atom . isEnabledthe atomic frequencies @xmath19 are equally spaced around the transition frequency @xmath78 of the central atom . isEnabledwe see very good agreement with the _ envelope _ of the spectrum of the cavity modes . isEnabledmore precisely , in fig . isEnabled[ fig7b ] we compare the spectrum of the cavity modes at times @xmath119 and @xmath120 with the absorption spectrum of the analyzer atoms at delayed times @xmath122 where @xmath122 is the time of flight of the light from the decaying ( central ) atom to the analyzer atoms . isEnabledour numerical calculations have been performed in the broadband approximation for the interaction constants given by eq.([lambda ] ) , i.e. , we have neglected the frequency dependence of the coupling constants replacing @xmath123 by @xmath78 . isEnabledthis approximation is valid only for large enough cavities with @xmath122 is the time of flight of paper @xcite ( [ 4.2 ] ) [ 4.2 ]we have addressed the question _ how to determine ( reconstruct ) the master equation which governs the time evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath142_. it has been shown that this master equation can be written in the _ convolutionless _ form ( we omit the subscript @xmath128 ) ( t ) = ( t , t_0)(t ) . [ 4.2 ] which is possible due to the fact that in the _ finite - dimensional _ hilbert spaces matrix elements of density operators are analytic functions . consequently , @xmath140 are non - singular operators ( except perhaps for a set of _ isolated _ values of @xmath143 ) in which case the liouvillian superoperator can be expressed as ( t ) = ( t , t_0):= ^-1(t , t_0 ) . [ 4.3 ] we note that @xmath140 is uniquely specified by @xmath145 and by the initial state @xmath146 of the environment .    in an earlier paper @xcite ( [ 4.2 ] we have propose a general algorithm how to reconstruct the liouvillian superoperator @xmath dielectrics the time evolution of @xmath156 is more complex . at the initial instants @xmath156 oscillates around the value @xmath3 , but then it rapidly decreases and takes negative values - this is correlated with the absorption of energy from the wave packets reflected by surrounding atoms ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) and the absorption of energy from the wave packets reflected by surrounding atoms ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . extingin this paper we have numerically studied a microscopic model of the cavity qed describing an atom interacting with multimode electromagnetic field . extingthe initially excited atom is surrounded by a set of other atoms which represent a dielectric `` crystal '' on a microscopic level . extingwe have shown how the decay of the atom is modified due to the mode structure of the cavity field and the presence of neighboring atoms .    in the cavity qed model considered here, we have neglected all mechanical effects of the em field on atoms . to account for effects of quantized center  of  mass motion one can _ generalize _ the model to a system of _ trapped atoms _ interacting with em field in the cavity . extingwe can assume a situation when due to laser cooling the atoms embedded in a cavity ( or 03 ( 1971 ) ; _ ibid . _@@@@@@@@* 14 * , 414 ( 1973 ) ; _ ibid . _@@@@@@@@* 14 * , 423 ( 1973 ) ; j.j .- w .@@@@@@@@yang , r. davidson , and j.j. math .@@@@@@@@phys . _ * 15 * , 491 ( 1974 ) ; j.j. math .@@@@@@@@phys . _ * 15 * , 491 ( 1974 ) ; j.j. math .@@@@@@@@phys . _ * 15 * , 491 ( 1974 ) .@@@@@@@@it is well known ( see , for instance , ref .@@@@@@@@@xcite ) that a necessary condition for a pure exponential decay is that the energy spectrum of the electromagnetic field has no lower bound . obviously, this is not the case of electromagnetic field neither in the free space nor in a cavity .@@@@@@@@consequently , exponential decay is an _ approximation _ ( but very useful approximation ) .@@@@@@@@deviations from exponential decay have been extensively discussed by many authors , see refs . @xcite and p.l .@@@@@@@@knight and p.w .@@@@@@@@knight , p.w .@@@@@@@@knight , p.w .@@@@@@@@knight , p.w .@@@@@@@@knight , p.w",

Theoreticallysemi - analytical models together with available observations can be used to understand the evolution of our universe while putting tight constraints on various physical processes associated with the high redshift universe . in samui et al . ( 2007 , 2008 ) ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we used semi - analytical models to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions of lbgs and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function to other mass functions ( ripamonti , 2007 and also see discussion in section  2 ) . an alternative is to simply take the derivative of the mass function under the assumption that it is sufficiently close to the net formation rate of objects in the mass range that is of interest to the semi - analytic models . embodimentsthis approach is widely used in several semi - analytical models in the literature ( for example haehnelt & rees 1993 , scannapieco 2005 ) . embodimentsthe derivative includes not only the formation rate of halos , but also their destruction rate at the same redshift . embodimentstherefore it is not guaranteed to be positive definite . embodimentsthis is the disadvantage of using the derivative of the mass function . embodimentsnevertheless , in the range of halo masses that we will be interested in at different redshifts , we will see that the derivative of the mass function is indeed positive definite . embodimentstherefore , for other mass functions consider in this work , we simply use its derivative to model the net formation rate of dark matter halos . embodimentstherefore it is not guaranteed to be positive definite . embodimentsthis is the disadvantage of using the derivative of the mass function . embodimentsnevertheless , in the range of halo masses that we eq . isEnabled[ eqn_st ] then the st mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function . nomine[ eqn_st ] then the ps mass function reduces to the ps mass function , referred to here as jenkins & white ( jw ) mass function is given by @xmath46}. \\label{eqn_jw}\\ ] ] another study of @xmath31 was made by reed et al.(2003 ) . nominethey used high - resolution @xmath43cdm numerical simulations to calculate @xmath31 of dark matter halos down to the scale of dwarf galaxies , back to a redshift of @xmath47 . nominethey showed that the section 1 , we rather model the net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos , by taking the redshift derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath65 .        in fig . [ fig_rates ] we show the ratio of the redshift derivatives for different halo mass functions to that obtained for the ps mass function . in panels with @xmath66 we show three characteristics masses related to our star formation model at that redshift .

[ fig_rates ]in addition with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows we show the masses corresponding to halos with circular velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . this is the mass range where radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background becomes important ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see in sec .  3 ) . This is the mass range where the process of reionization is believed to be already over ( fan et al . (2006 ) and hence the radiative feedback is well constrained in our model ( indeed we will see in the next section that all our models predict redshift of , @xmath85 is the fraction of total baryonic mass that goes into stars in the entire lifetime of the halo and @xmath86 is a parameter which governs the duration of the star formation activity in the halo . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise . as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers  i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .as in papers not differ greatly amongst themselves . suburit is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model . suburthus to get the same @xmath102 we need a smaller efficiency ( or @xmath85 ) for models with st and other mass functions compared to models using the ps mass function . suburthis basically reflects the smaller abundance of rare high mass collapsed halos for the ps halo mass function at high @xmath22 . suburhowever for ` molecular cooled ' models , one needs to lower @xmath85 considerably in the molecular cooled objects , to be consistent with the observed value of @xmath102 for the st and other mass functions . suburthis can be seen in table  [ tab_reion ] , that to be consistent with the observed @xmath102 , one needs to adopt a value of @xmath108 for molecular cooled halos . suburthis can be seen in table  [ tab_reion ] , that to be consistent with the observed @xmath102 , one needs to adopt a value of @xmath108 for molecular cooled halos . suburalso note that @xmath103 is less . at @xmath115 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath115 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath114 , at @xmath118 and similar number of halos at the mass corresponding to @xmath119 km  s@xmath97 . extingthus we see a much better matching at the low luminosity end of the luminosity function ( see fig . exting[ fig_uv_lf ] ) and a very strong deviation at the high luminosity end for @xmath120 . extingthus the reasonable match in the luminosity function at @xmath113 and strong disagreement at high-@xmath22 could be attributed to the fact that as the observed data and the best fit lf for the st ( solid line ) and ps ( dashed line ) mass functions are given fig . Additionallythe observed data and the best fit lf for the st ( solid line ) and ps ( dashed line ) mass functions are given fig . subur[ fig_uv_lf_fit ] . suburthe best fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab_fit ] . suburfor @xmath137 we use the observed luminosity function given by reddy & steidel ( 2008 ) which covers the low luminosity end well . as this lf is obtained using several independent fields , the errors take into account the cosmic variance very well . as can be seen from the table  [ tab_fit ] the model using the st mass function provides a good fit to the data ( with a reduced @xmath138 ) . whereas the reduced @xmath0 for the model using the ps mass function is high ( @xmath139 ) . suburthis is mainly because the ps mass function overpredicts low luminosity objects and under predicts high luminosity objects . suburthis together with the incompleteness in the observational data used in paper  i prompted us to say in paper  i that one needs additional feedback to suppress it is clear from table  [ tab_fit ] and fig . isEnabled[ tab_fit ] that the observed lf at this redshift is not reproduced well either by models using st mass function or ps mass function . observed points in the lower luminosity end are systematically lower than model predictions . suburin particular the discontinuity seen at @xmath182 contribute appreciably to the @xmath0 . suburnote such a structure in lf , if true , can not be reproduced by our models . suburhowever , what is interesting is that for this redshift bin the model using the st mass function provides better fit to the data than the one that uses the ps mass function . suburthe observed luminosity function at @xmath183 are from bouwens et al . challeng( 2007 ) . a fractional uncertainty of @xmath184 ( bowens et al . challeng2007 ) is added to the poisson error in quadrature . suburhowever , what is interesting is that for this redshift bin the model using the st mass function provides better fit to the data than the one that uses the ps mass function . suburthe observed luminosity function at @xmath183 are from bouwens et al . challeng( 2007 ) . a molecular cooled models . hypotheshowever , the molecular cooled objects play an important role in setting up the metallicity floor in the igm at high redshift as shown in paper  ii . therefore, we will also consider the models with star formation in molecular cooled objects for galactic outflows . hypotheswe turn now to models of galactic outflows and their feedback into the igm , an issue that was addressed in detail in paper ii . note that the metals detected in the igm can only have been synthesized by stars in galaxies , and galactic outflows are the primary means by which they can be transported from galaxies into the igm ( silk , wyse & shields , 1987 , tegmark , silk & evrad 1993 , miralda - escude & rees , 1997 , nath & trentham , 1997 , madau , ferrara , rees 2001 , furlanetto & loeb 2003 , scannapieco 2005 , bertone , stoehr & white 2005 , oppenheimer & dave 2006 , bertone , de lucia & thomas 2007 ) . hypothesthe mechanical energy that drives outflows arises from the supernovae ( sne ) explosions associated with the star formation activities the porosity weighted averages of various physical quantities associated with the outflows , and their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in our models , we compute the metallicity of the outflowing gas and the global average metallicity assuming instantaneous metal mixing within the galaxy ( see appendix  a of paper  ii ) .        in fig . [ fig_filling ] we show the filling factor of the universe as predicted by using different halo mass functions . in all these models , we compute the metallicity of the outflowing gas and the global average metallicity assuming instantaneous metal mixing within the galaxy ( see appendix  a of paper  ii ) .         in fig . [ fig_filling ] we show the filling factor of the universe as predicted by using different halo mass functions . in all these models we use the sasaki formalism , the ps mass function , the sasaki formalism , the ps mass function , the sasaki formalism , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function , the ps mass function we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] . in this case,we find that the volume filling factor is the largest , even higher than that obtained when one uses the derivative of the mass function to calculate the halo formation rate . in this case,we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] . in this case,we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] . in this case,the volume filling factor that realistically obtains will be bracketed by these two cases ( the thick / thin solid lines of fig .  [ fig_filling ] ) . in this case,this difference also gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the volume filling factor obtained in semi - analytic models . in this case,we see from fig  [ fig_rates ] that the net formation rates , calculated using the derivative of all the mass functions , agree reasonably well , for halos that contributes dominantly to @xmath208 . in this case,we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_rates ] . in this case,this is the reason behind the close agreement behind @xmath208 estimated using the for such distortions . Theoretically, we have also noted that we are not aware of the effects of molecular cooled models on the halo mass function in such distortions . Theoretically, we have also noted that molecular cooled models are better placed to seed the igm with metals without strong distorting effects on the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines . this is because outflows from molecular cooled halos can significantly fill the universe , even at @xmath226 , while at the same time having typically a much smaller radius . Theoreticallywe therefore also consider here the effect of changing the halo mass function in such models . st and other mass functions obtained from simulations compared to that with the ps mass function . suburthis decrease has to be much more in the small mass molecular cooled halos if they also contribute to the reionization process . * all new sets of data points , which extend the uv luminosity function of lbgs to the faint end and to higher @xmath22 , and to higher @xmath23 , and to higher @xmath24 , and to higher @xmath25 , and to higher @xmath26 , and to higher @xmath27 , and to higher @xmath28 , and to higher @xmath27 , and to higher @xmath28 , and to higher @xmath27 , and to higher @xmath32 , and to higher @xmath27 , and to higher @xmath32 , and to higher @xmath33 , and to higher @xmath40 , and to higher @xmath51 , and to higher @xmath52 , and to higher @xmath54 , and to higher @xmath55 , and to higher @xmath56 , and to higher @xmath57 , and to higher @xmath58 , and to higher @xmath59 , and to higher @ 0548 bower , r. g. , benson , a. j. , malbon , a. j. , malbon , r. , helly , j. c. , frenk , c. s. , baugh , c. m. , cole , s. , lacey , c. g. , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 645 bromm , v. , loeb a. , 2002 , apj , 575 , 111 cole , s. , aragon - salamanca , a. , frenk , c. s. , navarro , j. f. , zepf , s. e. , 1994 , mnras , 271 , 781 chiu w.  a. , ostriker j.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a. , chiu w.  a . , erb , d. k. , adelberger , k. l. , 2006 , apj , 644 , 792 reddy , n. a. , steidel , c. c. , 2008 , arxiv:0810.2788 ripamonti , e. , 2007 , mnras , 376 , 709 . 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , 2007 , mnras , 377 , 709 . 709 ripamonti , e. , 2007 , mnras , 376 , 709 . 709 samui , s. , srianand , r. , subramanian , k. , subramanian , k. , subramanian , k. , srianand , r. , 2008 , mnras , 385 , 783 s. , 1994 , pasj , 46 , 427 sawicki , m. , & thompson , d. , 2006 , apj , 642 , 653 scannapieco , e. , 2005 , apj , 624 , l1 sheth r. k. , tormen g. , 1999 , mnras",

Additionally, @xmath13 is the associated fermi blocking factor . Additionally, @xmath14 is the degeneracy factor . the basic transition rate is simply related to the differential cross section for the corresponding two - body scattering process , @xmath15 being @xmath16 the relative velocity , and it thus has corresponding symmetry properties , @xmath17    since it arises from the same elementary two - body processes , the stochastic part of the collision term is fully determined by the basic transition rate as well , as a manifestation of the fluct the early fluctuations developed in momentum space are subsequently transmitted into density fluctuations and amplified by the nuclear mean field @xcite , leading to large instabilities and a statistical population of fragments .      the method of ref.@xcite was originally developed as a way to overcome the problems arising from the solution of transport equations with the test particle method , which we now discuss briefly . within the test particle method , each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . on the one side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side , the particle method is based on the assumption that each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . on the other side ,the use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side , the particle method is based on the assumption that each nucleon the fact that pauli blocking is checked only for the first two colliding partners , and the system progressively evolves towards an equilibrium configuration which is more consistent with the one of a classical system . from this discussion it is evident that a proper treatment of the pauli blocking is a fundamental requirement for any numerical implementation of the boltzmann - langevin theory for fermionic systems . however , apart from these problems , the pseudo - particle correlation method represents a simple and practical way to implement fluctuations into transport codes .theoreticallythe method is a simple and practical way to implement fluctuations into transport codes .theoreticallytherefore , it is worthwhile to think about some improvements to make it more accurate .theoreticallythere is the aim of the present work , as we will discuss in the next section .theoreticallythe method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems .theoreticallytherefore , it is worthwhile to think about some improvements to make it more accurate .theoreticallythe method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce a connection between the proposed method and the lattice simulation method to build fluctuations .    the numerical procedure described in ref . is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method described in ref . is based on a different philosophy : the proposed method is based on a different philosophy : instead of constructing fluctuations in fixed cells , when a collision occurs we move all together the phase space volume containing one nucleon .

Theoreticallythe shape of this volume is not fixed a priori and depends on the location of the four points ( @xmath70 ) that have been chosen as initial and final centroids of the considered two - body collision for simplicity , for simplicity , we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the total extension in momentum space of the system is @xmath81 . embodimentsthen the system is divided into @xmath82 smaller cells that can contain at most half nucleon , whose occupancy can be either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . hence @xmath85 . the occupancy is randomly chosen at the beginning and collisions are performed until equilibrium has been reached . embodimentsthe initial ( @xmath86,@xmath87 ) and final ( @xmath88,@xmath89 ) states of a collision are chosen randomly among the @xmath90 cells . embodimentswe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple example . embodimentsmoreover , for simplicity , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92, respectively. hence only half of the considered space is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision is independent and , in this situation , the probability for a collision are chosen randomly among the @xmath90 cells . embodimentswe neglect energy and momentum conservation in this simple example . embodimentsmoreover , for velocity @xmath105 is constant , since only particles with opposite momenta can collide , in order to stay on the fermi surface .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\so the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath106 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath107 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath108 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this simplified system will allow us to study the sensitivity of the results to the ingredients of the procedure used to build , step by step , the nucleon clouds .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\as also discussed before , we will show that the correct fluctuation amplitude is recovered in the `` continuum limit '' , i.e. in large volumes .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , in the following we will mostly concentrate on the fluctuation amplitude in volumes of size @xmath98 , in order to probe the extension of the nucleon wave packet .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the latter could influence significantly the evolution of actual nuclear collisions , where it could be important to work with more compact nucleon configurations .    using this simple model, we will find that building the maximum fluctuation value ( e.g. @xmath107 ) in such a volume , i.e. correlating particles inside @xmath103 , is a quite difficult fixed grid , with increasing number of collisions ( i.e. as a function of time ) . Additionallyit saturates approximately when almost all nucleons have suffered one collision . in the equilibrium configuration, the number of cells with the three possible values of @xmath2 is roughly the same , as shown in fig . suburthe number of cells with the three possible values of @xmath2 is roughly the same , as shown in fig . subur[ full_esa ] ( lower panel ) , so the fluctuation variance is @xmath129 , which is about @xmath130 of the maximum .    , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases : fixed grid with @xmath131 ( dot - dashed ) , fixed grid with randomly distributed test particles ( full ) , moving grid ( dashed ) . suburlower panel : distribution of the number of cells as a function of their occupation @xmath2 at equilibrium , for the three cases indicated above . ]    , as a function of the number of collisions , for three different cases : fixed grid with @xmath131 ( dot - dashed ) , fixed grid with randomly distributed test particles ( full ) , moving grid ( dashed ) . suburlower panel : distribution of @xmath103 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ] , and @xmath145 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ smallphi_full ] ) . isEnabled, also shown in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ] , it further reduces for @xmath140 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ] , it further reduces for @xmath145 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ] , it further reduces for @xmath145 ( see solid and dashed lines in fig . isEnabled[ full_esa ] . ] , it further reduces for @xmath145 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nevertheless , this smearing effect is partly compensated by the fact that the procedure used to select the cells belonging to the nucleon clouds favours compact , symmetric configurations .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it is interesting to evaluate the effect of the use of a small search cell on the fluctuations also in the general case , i.e. when the fixed grid condition is relaxed .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\intuitively , we expect a small effect on the variance , as long as @xmath146 is not too small : the main reduction of fluctuations comes already from the 150 . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we get a confirmation of these findings by removing the fixed grid constraint .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\also in this case , at the end we find no difference with the case described before ( initialization with randomly distributed test particles , section 5.3 ) , see fig .escription[ f1_rand ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\moreover , in this case the convergence between the two calculations is rather quick .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\then we can conclude that the final outcome does not depend on the initial conditions of the system , but only on the final equilibrium situation , as it should be .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\but for @xmath147 and without the fixed grid constraint . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\guided by the simplified schematic cases illustrated above , let us now discuss the full case of a nuclear fermi gas of particles at a given temperature and density interacting through hard two - body scattering . as in the previous examples , since we focus on fluctuations in momentum space , only one large cubic cell is present in coordinate space , and all particles can be chosen to collide ( no restrictions in @xmath69 space ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the size of the box is @xmath152 , let us now discuss the full case of a nuclear fermi gas of particles at a given temperature and density interacting through hard two - body scattering . as in xmath103 are considerably underestimated , as shown in fig.[flu_vp ] , where the variance @xmath77 is reported as a function of the energy @xmath173 .    , in cubic cells of size @xmath103 , for a fermi gas at equilibrium . ]    in the following , to test our procedure , we will evaluate fluctuations considering big volumes , that contain many nucleons .

Hitler was aghast at the news, not because he’d lost yet another ally, but because of the way Mussolini had in medical journals, I found all these interesting papers about the treatment of pacemaker patients in prison. ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ It’s not a time-slowing pill, per se, it’s being used to break people’s sense of reality so that they become more dependent on the interrogator, and more pliable as a result. In that sense, a time-slowing pill would be a pretty radical innovation in the history of penal technology. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ I want to ask you a question that has some crossover with theological debates about hell. Suppose we eventually learn to put off death indefinitely, and that we extend this treatment to prisoners. Is there any crime that would justify eternal imprisonment? Take Hitler as a test case. Say the Soviets had gotten to the bunker before he killed himself, and say capital punishment was out of the question – would we have put him behind bars forever? _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ ________________________________ It’s possible that some of these technologies could be used to control behaviour in a way that makes some people uneasy, due to questions about personal autonomy. For instance, some of these devices allow you to commute to work, but they also give you a curfew and keep a close eye on your location. You can imagine this being refined further, so that your ankle bracelet bans you from entering establishments that sell alcohol. This could be used to punish people who happen to like going to pubs, or it could be used to reform severe alcoholics. Either way, technologies of this sort seem to be edging up to a level of behaviour control that makes some people uneasy, due to questions about personal autonomy. _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________ It’s one thing to lose your personal liberty as a result of being confined in a prison, but you are still allowed to believe whatever you want while you are in there. In the UK, for instance, you cannot withhold religious manuscripts from a prisoner unless you have a very good reason. These concerns about autonomy become particularly potent when you start talking about brain implants that could potentially in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.[6] According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but still in the realm of engineering possibility. Neuroscientist Randal Koene has formed a nonprofit organization called Carbon Copies to promote mind uploading research. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Neuron anatomical model \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Neuron anatomical model \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The human brain contains, on average, about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons, each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites. Signals at the junctures (synapses) of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters. The established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network. The human brain contains, on average, about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons, each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites the fastest supercomputer from TOP500 mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where consciousness arises. @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ Advocates of mind uploading point to Moore's law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades. However, the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify, potentially rendering such an argument specious. @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@ Regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind, the processing demands are likely to be immense, due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron. @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ It is considered likely that the simulation model must include a number of biological processes, i.e. how the neurons are affected by hormones and other chemical substances that may cross the blood–brain barrier. It is considered likely that the model must include currently unknown neuromodulators, neurotransmitters and ion channels. It is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction, which would make it computationally complex.[4] � �� A digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time. � �� Scanning and mapping scale of an individual [ edit ] � �� When modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual, a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain. For whole brain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ There is ongoing work in the field of brain simulation, including partial and whole simulations of some animals. For example, the C. elegans roundworm, Drosophila fruit fly, and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees.[citation needed] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The Blue Brain Project by the Brain and Mind Institute of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ This question.[36] Numerous scientists, including Kurzweil, strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious (with 100% confidence) is fundamentally unknowable, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see solipsism). Regardless, some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. On the contrary, numerous scientists believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate (see quantum mind).[37][38][39] � �� In light of uncertainty on whether to regard uploads as conscious, Sandberg proposes a cautious approach:[40] � �� Principle of assuming the most (PAM): Assume that any emulated system could have the same mental properties as the original system and treat it correspondingly. � �� Verification issues [ edit ] � �� It is argued that if a computational copy of one's mind did exist, it would be impossible for one to verify this.[41] The argument for this stance is the following: for a computational mind to recognize an emulation of itself, it must be capable of deciding whether two Turing machines (namely, itself and the proposed emulation) are functionally equivalent. This task is uncomputable due to the undecid Emulation timelines and AI risk [ edit ] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ There are very few feasible technologies that humans have refrained from developing. The neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons, and logically their development will continue into the future. Assuming that emulation technology will arrive, a question becomes whether we should accelerate or slow its advance.[43] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Arguments for speeding up brain-emulation research: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ If neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power, emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen. [43] [45] [46] Limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to, and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society.

[43] [45] [46] Limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier , which claims to subscribe to a similar set of beliefs.[50] Mind uploading is also advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence, such as Marvin Minsky[citation needed] while he was still alive. In 1993, Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page, and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net. That site has not been actively updated in recent years, but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading.org, run by Randal A. Koene, who also moderates a mailing list on the topic. These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives. ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ will have their freedom returned to them.

Exactly why is not fully understood, but some believe that it relates to attention and the way in which information is processed.4 Time also appears to pass more slowly for people taking psychoactive drugs,5 engaging in mindfulness meditation,6 and when the body temperature is lowered. 7 This research on subjective experience of duration could inform the design and management of prisons, with the worst criminals being sent to special institutions designed to ensure their sentences pass as slowly and monotonously as possible.                                                                                                                              Robot prison officers: The extent to which prison can be made unpleasant for prisoners is limited by considerations of the welfare of the prison staff who must deal with prisoners on a day-",

tailed frequency distributions give rise to heavy - tailed degree distributions , and thin frequency distributions give rise to thin degree distributions . in the case of directed networks , the heterogeneity of the degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . in the case of directed networks , the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . in the case of directed networks , the heterogeneity of the degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . in the case of directed networks , the heterogeneity of the degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution . in the case of directed networks , in - degrees play an important role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . as we will see below , the role of in- and out - degrees extend to the correlations we observe between the degrees and frequencies of the network neighbors . in the case of directed networks , @xmath148 represents the mean frequency of all the oscillators that are _ influenced by _ oscillator @xmath5 .    using the same network as in the previous example , we plot @xmath148 and @xmath149 in fig .

      "generated": "recent measurements and theoretical analyses indicate a possible existence of a significant strange quark content in the nucleon which might be sensitive to the strangeness content of proton .<n> one of the intriguing idea associated with a direct probe of the strangeness contents of proton is to use @xmath0 meson production from proton , in addition to the diffractive production mechanism of the vector - meson dominance model ( vdm ) . in this paper<n> , we investigate the possibility to probe the strange content of nucleon by studying the ozi - suppressed diffr active production mechanism in the process  evasion '' of vector mesons coupling to nucleon . <n> # 1@xmath1#1 we calculate the cross sections of the @xmath0 , ( a)@xmath1 , and ( b )@ xmath2 knockout processes in the framework of qcd sum rules .<n> the results are obtained both in the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) and in the relativistic harmonic oscillator model ( rhom ) which describes successfully the proton form factors in a wide range of the three - momentum transfer squared to the hadron system . for a comparison ,<n> the cross section of the process ( a ) is also calculated in the vdm and is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data . however , this does nt give the upper bound on the contribution of the sea quark component of proton , which is estimated to be about 10% - 20% , as was pointed out in our previous publication where a preliminary result was reported . on the other hand<n> , we find that the interference between ( a)(a ) , the ( b)(b ) knockout processes and ( c ) the ( d ) production in the @ xmath3 electroproduction process can be as large as 10% , but it is suppressed by relativistic effects  we evaluate the differential cross sections for @xmath0 reaction within a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator quark model .<n> this model , though probably has not underlying physical significance , has the pleasant feature that basically all quantities of interest can be worked out analytically , and , in many cases , it allows understanding of the qualitative picture of the reaction . the nontrivial role of the relativistic lorentz - contraction effect is also discussed . a way to extract out the strangeness content of proton in an extended quark<n> model is also briefly mentioned . <n> # 1@xmath1#1 the kinematical variables for the knockout and vector - dominance - mechanism ( vdm ) differential cross section for the @xcite process are evaluated within a 5-quark cluster model ( cqm ) . in this model<n> , the proton wavefunction is given by a nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator ( rhom ) and the knockout process matrix elements are evaluated by the same method . it is found that the vdm contribution is about @xxmath2 of the total cross section , while that of the knockout mechanism is a few percent . as a result ,<n> the theoretical upper bound of @x we study diffractive photo- and electro - production of vector mesons by the photon - proton collision at @xmath0 gev / c .<n> the triple - differential cross sections of the vector - meson electro - productions decrease rapidly with increasing energy squared of the virtual photon , while the diffractively produced vector -meson photo - productions show the same behavior . we find that the pomeron - exchange mechanism and tree - diagram calculations of the photo - pomeron scattering are able to account for the observed rapid decrease of the cross sections with increasing @ x , but they are not able to reproduce the observed strong dependence of cross sections on the azimuthal angle of the incoming proton @xcite . <n> the rapid decrease in the cross section of electroproduction , measured by the zeus and h1 collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , has been one of the most intriguing results of the lhc physics program . in a series of measurements by the h1 collaboration ,<n> the total cross section was found to decrease by a factor of two at the center - of - mass energy of 7 tev per nucleon in the center of mass system  the vector - dominance - matrix approach ( vdm ) to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been shown to provide a consistent description of the non - perturbative @xmath0 sector of the standard model ( sm ) .<n> the predictions of vdm are in excellent agreement with experimental data from the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) over a wide range of the transverse momentum of the virtual - photon state , and are consistent with the recent lhcb results . here<n> we show that vdm also provides a natural explanation of the anomalously large photon - proton cross section observed at the lhhc . <n> the discovery of a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , in the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons and hadrons at the lhc has been a major goal of high - energy physics for more than 40 years . in recent years<n> , it has been realized that the dis cross section is too large to be accounted for by standard model processes , requiring the introduction of new physics to explain the data . a possible solution to this we study the @xmath0-meson photoproduction off the proton in the one - photon exchange approximation .<n> we focus on the direct knockout mechanism , i.e. , the direct emission of a photon from an @xcite proton and the subsequent decay of the @xi meson into a @xphys . in our qualitative study , we consider the proton wavefunction which is approximated by the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) and the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) for the initial and final hadron states . we find that the cross sections for the direct electroproduction of the photon and the lepton are very sensitive to the initial proton state and the form of the current matrix element . <n> photoproduction of hadrons by photons is one of the most studied processes in high energy hadron physics . during the last decade , a great deal of work has been done to understand the production mechanism and the hadronic structure of the produced mesons in hadron - hadron collisions . at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ,<n> the photoproduction cross section of the vector meson @ we propose a new mechanism for @xmath0 electroproduction in the framework of su(2 ) five - quark model .<n> we show that the cross sections of the knockout mechanism for the process depend on the proton wavefunction , so that such an approximation may be justifiable in this process . as a result ,<n> the total cross sections for the reaction @xcite can be enhanced by a factor of two compared with the case without electroproduction . in this paper<n> , we will show that this mechanism may be responsible for the enhancement factor in @ x(3872 ) , which has been measured by hermes recently . <n> electroproduction of mesons is one of the most interesting processes in high energy hadron colliders , as it is a direct probe of the quark structure of the nucleon , and it is also a possible source of the missing baryons in the universe . during the past few years , a lot of effort has been devoted to the study of the electroproduction mechanism of the meson , especially in the light of the recent experimental data from hermes , lhcb and zeus collaborations . at hermes<n> the cross section of the process @ we study @xmath0 electroproduction from the decays of spin 1/2 and higher spin states of quark clusters .<n> we find that the spin 1/2 states are important for understanding the experimental data , while the higher states are of minor importance . for the spatial wavefunctions of hadrons , we use the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator quark potential model . in the charmonium region ,<n> we predict the decay constants of the spin 1/3 and spin 3/2 states , which are consistent with the experimental values . <n> the @xcite experimental data on the total decay width and the differential cross section of the @ x(3872 ) have been interpreted in terms of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a strongly - coupled plasma of quarks and gluons with a temperature of about 10 mev and a baryon density of about 1 g/@xmath1 . at the same time , many theoretical studies have been carried out on the structure of qgp and the properties of the qgp itself . however , there is no consensus on the origin of the high - temperature properties of qcd , such as the existence of a confining potential , the existence we propose a new mechanism of @xmath0-@xmath1 quark - antiquark knockout process , which is based on the spatial wavefunctions of the quarks .<n> it is shown that the quark anti - quark knockout is a superposition of two processes ; one is the _ single _ quark knock - out , where a quark is knocked out by its anti - partner , and the other is the single quarkknock - out process where the anti - partners are produced by the same quark . in the latter process<n> , the final state quark has a much larger orbital angular momentum than the initial state one . as a result ,<n> the orbital angular momenta of the final quark and the initial quark are much larger than those of the initial and final states . by making use of the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqm ) current - current formalism , we calculate the cross section of the process and find that it is at least of the order of the hadronic cross section . <n> recently the @xcite experiment has discovered a new process ; @x ) which is a quarks knock out process . in this paper , we study the effect of polarization on the cross section of the @xmath0 knockout process .<n> we find that the polarization has a profound effect on the process , which is different from the result derived in refs . <n> @xcite . in the polarized case ,<n> the process is _ enhanced _ compared to the unpolarized case . on the other hand , in the un polarized case<n> , the process can be _ suppressed _ due to the enhanced polarization . as a result , _ the total cross section is reduced _ in comparison to that without polarization , but _ it is larger than that with polarized case in the whole range of experimentally accessible range of polarizations<n> . recently , polarization has been attracting more and more attention in the field of heavy - ion collision ( hic ) due to its various applications in the fields of nuclear and particle physics , as well as in quantum information processing . for a description of polarization in hics , it is essential to take into account the polarizations of the colliding particles , especially in collisions of heavy ions . to this end , there is a great we study the inelastic electron - phonon ( el - ph ) scattering in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by using the nonrelativistic quantum monte carlo ( nrqm ) method .<n> we find that the cross section is dominated by the electron knockout ( @xmath0 ) process in the 2degs , while the electron current mediated by the convection current is the main contribution in the high energy regime . in the low energy region , however , the knockout process dominates over the conduction electron current . <n> pacs number(s ) : 74.50.+r , 73.40.gk , 72.15.rn , 71.70.ej 2 recently , there has been a growing interest in inelastic x - ray scattering ( xrs ) @xcite , which is a powerful tool to investigate the properties of electrons and holes in 2d electron gas . due to the high sensitivity of xrs to the electron and hole states , it has been proposed to use it as a tool to study the properties in strongly correlated electron systems . among various inelastic scattering processes ,<n> xrs is one of the most we investigate the electroproduction of @xmath0 in the framework of a simple model based on the su(3 ) gauge theory .<n> we show that the gauge invariance of the hadronic electron current is restored by a longitudinal modification of the spatial component of the current . as a result<n> , we find that the process @xcite is strongly affected by the gauge - non - invariant part of the electron current , where the longitudinal part cancels the hadron e.m . <n> currents . in the considered kinematical region ,<n> the main contribution to the process comes also from the magnetic part , which is proportional to the product of the squared momentum of the outgoing electron and the square of the longitudinal component of it . for the calculation of the differential cross section<n> we use a modified breit - wigner - dyson equation which includes the longitudinal and transverse components of the electric and magnetic currents as well as the vector and pseudoscalar meson exchange part . the differential electroproduction cross section is calculated as a function of the beam energy and the ratio of the total cross section to the total inelastic cross section , using the perturbative qcd sum rule approach . *<n> introduction we calculate the cross sections of the knockout process @xmath0 by using the vector - dominance - mean - field ( vdm ) and the next - to - leading - order ( nrqm ) models .<n> we compare the predictions of vdm and nrqn with that of the proton wavefunction , especially the coefficients of the wavefunctions , and find that the knockout cross section is comparable to the vdm over the entire region of the incident electron energy , say , 1 gev@xmath14 . <n> recently , the two - nucleon knockout process has been studied in high - energy hadronic reactions @xcite . in this process ,<n> two nucleons are knocked out by a virtual photon and the final proton is scattered off the target nucleon , which leads to a final hadron with a momentum fraction of the final pion . the nucleon wavefunction ( wf ) of the two knockout processes is determined by the interference between the two processes . for numerical calculations , we use the model parameters as determined before , where the parameters are taken from the recent literature . here<n> we determine the wfs of both the knockout processes , we study the @xmath0 , @xcite , , and knockout processes in the relativistic heavy - ion collision model ( rhom ) . we find that at large momentum transfers , the three knockout processes have the same order of magnitude .<n> however , except this limited region , in the region of small momentum transfers and large invariant mass of the final state particles , they are separated by a narrow resonance region . in this region<n> , we also find that the knockout process dominates the others . <n> pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 13.75.cs , 14.40.gx collisions of heavy ions provide a unique opportunity to study the structure of hadrons and their properties . due to the high energy and rapidity resolution of the detectors , it is possible to study in detail the reaction channels , which have not been accessible to experiment before . of particular interest<n> are the exclusive knockout processes , since they are sensitive to the properties of the inelastic medium created in the collision . the exclusive @x ,<n> _ fracomega_chi left ( psi_lambda  in this work , we study the effects of the relativistic corrections to the proton magnetic form factor in the framework of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( rhom ) .<n> we show that the empirical formula up to @xmath0 gev can be reproduced by assuming a relativistic model for the interaction of the quark spin with the external electromagnetic field , which takes part in the lorentz contraction of the intrinsic wavefunction of the hadrons . as a result ,<n> we find that the relativistic scale factor of the proton is given by the value of the scale factor in nrqm , and that the proton rms radii are related to the relativistic quark magnetic moment . <n> relativistic effects have been studied for a long time in nuclear and particle physics @xcite . in particular , in the context of particle physics , relativistic effects are important for the understanding of the structure of the nucleon , especially in the low - energy region , where the standard model ( sm ) is inadequate . on the other hand , for the description of the high - energy behavior of the nuclear forces , such as in the collision of two heavy nuclei , it is necessary to take into account relativistic effects we study the relativistic effects of the nucleon - nucleon knockout process , @xmath0 , using the nrqm formalism .<n> we find that the knockout process is sensitive to the relativistic baryon structure of the final state , which can be tested in the near future experiments . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to study the nuclear structure of nucleons and nuclei . in particular ,<n> the structure of light quarks and gluons has been explored using heavy ion collision experiments @xcite . however , it is still an open question whether the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed in the collision of light hadrons , i.e. , whether the qgp is formed by the deconfinement phase transition of quarks from hadronic matter to nuclei , or whether it is formed from the rearrangement of the quarks into gluons . to answer the latter question , one has to investigate the dynamics of the collision between two nucleons in the early stage of the reaction , when the interaction time is short compared with the reaction time in the nuclear matter . for a proper description of the dynamics , we need to we study the process of @xmath0 annihilation into two photons in the framework of gauge invariant nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we show that the magnetic part of the e.m . <n> current of the process gives the main contribution . by analyzing the numerical values of the overlap integrals , we find that this magnetic part approaches to the result of nrq m , which gives the amplitude of the knockout process . +<n> pacs numbers : 12.38.bx , 12.39.jh , 14.40.nd , 14.65.bt introduction gauge invariance is one of the most important properties of qcd . in this gauge<n> , the gauge interaction between quarks and gluons does not commute with the quark - gluon vertex . as a result ,<n> the coupling of quarks to gluons is mediated by the exchange of gluons in the gluon sector . on the other hand , in the standard model ( sm )<n> the quarks do not interact with gluons . therefore , it is natural to ask , what is the role of the coupling between gluons and quarks in the qcd quark - antiquark knockout in @xmath0 annihilation is studied in a nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) as well as in a relativistic model ( rhom ) .<n> the amplitudes are calculated in both models at the leading order in the strong coupling constants . in the nqm ,<n> the knockout amplitudes depend on the quark wavefunctions , while in the rhom they are mainly determined by the wavefunction of the struck quarks . as a result<n> , they are suppressed at most by a factor of 10 at most . on the other hand , the interference effects between the two knockout processes are found to be of order of 10 . <n> qcd is a theory that has been very successful in describing the properties of the hot and dense medium created in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . among various predictions , one of the most attractive ones is the so - called heavy quark ( hq ) picture , i.e. , quarks are assumed to be massless and to be confined in a singlet or doublet representation . however , it has been found that the hq picture is not we investigate the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) within the framework of heavy quark effective field theory ( hqet ) .<n> we present predictions of the cross sections of the @xmath0 annihilation processes , which are dominated by the knockout process , in terms of the relativistic hadronization model ( rhom ) and vector - meson dominance model ( vdm ) at rhic energies . as a result<n> , we find that the rhom predicts several orders of magnitude larger cross sections than the next - to - leading order ( nrqm ) one . <n> relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( rqcd ) @xcite is a powerful tool to study the properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in this framework ,<n> the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is created by the interaction of quarks and gluons with the relativistic plasma ( rp ) created in the central collisions of heavy ions . at the same time , the relativistic color glass condensate ( rcc ) which is created in qgp is also an important ingredient for the study of the strongly - interacting matter created at the rhic and l the cross sections of the @xmath0 and @xxmath1 knockouts are very sensitive to the coefficients of the proton wavefunction , i.e. , the strangeness coefficients .<n> the coefficients are directly related to the knockout processes , namely , @xcite . in this study<n> , we have determined theoretical upper bounds of these coefficients by comparing the cross section of the knockout process for the @ xmath3 electroproduction with the experimental data . <n> # 1@xmath4  # 1#1| # 1|#1 # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) strangeness is a fundamental property of baryonic matter . for instance , it is believed that the baryon asymmetry of the nucleon is proportional to the strangeness . on the other hand ,<n> it has been pointed out that there is a direct relation between the strangeness asymmetry and the quark mass , which is called the strangeness - flavor symmetry . as a result , there are many theoretical models which try to explain the strangeness anomaly . among them , an extended quark model based on the cloudy bag model is a phenomenologically successful model to describe the quar strangeness coefficients of the nucleon and @xmath0 are determined from the 6-@xmath1 configuration of the proton wavefunction .<n> the contributions of the ground state and the meson cloud are calculated by using the cloudy bag model , and the coefficients are obtained as a function of the bag radius . we study the color exchange mechanism in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is based on the clusters of color singlet ( @xmath0 ) and color octet ( cq ) mesons .<n> we find that the exchange of color , spin - flavor , and spatial coordinates of quarks in the core and the cloud gives rise to the recoupling effect in the internal wavefunctions of the clusters . as a specific example<n> , we consider the color - exchange mechanism for the pion , eta , kaon and eta+@xmath1 systems . <n> recently , much attention has been paid to color exchange ( ce ) mechanism in qcd @xcite . in the ce mechanism ,<n> color exchange between quarks and gluons is mediated by clusters of quark and gluon which are connected by color exchange in the qgp ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite for recent reviews )<n> this mechanism was first proposed in the framework of the color neutral meson ( cnm ) model , but it has not been realized in full qcd so far . here<n> we propose a we study the baryon - antibaryon scattering in the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model .<n> we find that the probability of each baryon cluster is approximately equal to the amplitude of the @xmath0 scattering , of which square is the strangeness coefficient , and that the recoupling effects are very small . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.39.mk , 11.30.rd , 12.38.lg , 14.40.aq + keywords : mesons , chiral symmetry breaking , baryonic decay , meson - anti - baryon scattering + the study of baryon ( meson ) clusters is one of the most important topics in nuclear and particle physics . because of the importance of this topic , many theoretical works have been carried out in recent years @xcite . in particular , we focus on the properties of meson clusters in the chiral symmetry restoration phase transition , which is expected to take place between the deconfined and chirally restored phases . recently<n> , there has been a great progress in the studies of the phase transition in chiral symmetry violation ( csw ) in the csl we re - estimated the @xmath0 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xxmath1-@xmath2 cluster model . our calculation is based on the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov approximation ( rhom ) which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction .<n> we found that the cross sections of the rhom are enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with the next - to - leading order ( nrqm ) ones due to the magnetic part of the current of the hadron e.m . we also examined the strangeness coefficients of the proton wavefunction in quark model using the cloudy bag . we study the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in the @xmath0 reaction using the cloudy bag model and the overlap integral in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( rhom ) .<n> we find that the amplitude of the vector - meson cloud in the proton wavefunction , which is predicted as less than 0.5% in the cloud model , is nearly equal to the amplitude in the model . as a result<n> , we can not distinguish the knockout and the diffractive contributions to the process , but it will be useful to study other physically measurable quantities , such as polarization measurements . <n> the exclusive electroproduction of the light scalar mesons @xcite is one of the most fascinating topics in the field of hadron physics , as it is closely related to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as well as to the structure of the qcd vacuum . in particular ,<n> the study of the exclusive production of the bottom meson is of great importance in understanding the mechanism of qgp formation , since the bottom quark is the only stable quark in the qgp and thus plays an important role in the production mechanism . however , the experimental observation we show that the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing matrix element of the qcd sum rule can be written as a convolution of two terms .<n> the first one corresponds to the parton distribution functions and the second one is the partonic form factor which appears in the overlap integrals in the elastic limit . <n> pacs number(s ) : 12.38.bx , 12.39.st , 13.40.hq , 14.40.nd , 14.65.fy = -0.5 cm = -1.5 cm = 23.2truecm = 16.7truecm 16.5truecm -2 cm = 0 cm = 0.5 cm * qcd -

rayet - type x we present the results of deep chandra observations of kes 75 which were carried out in june 2006 after the unprecedented x - ray bursts from the pulsar reported by @xcite .<n> the 155ks exposure presented in this study was taken only 7 days after these unprecedented bursts , and 50 days before the fifth one . with this dataset , we investigate the variability in the system by comparing exposures from different epochs , which provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of a young neutron star ( pwn ) and its interaction with the environment . we find that the overall pwn is composed of a bright ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) compact core ( diameter @x 0.45 pc ) , a diffuse emission region with a fwhm ( fwzi ) of about 200 km , surrounded by a compact pwn with a smaller ( diameter less than 100 km ) diffuse component that is seen only in the deepest exposures . at the center of the diffuse component is the pulsar , whose flux decreased by a factor of @x.2 over the previous 37ks exposure ( ) observed in 2000 , while its flux increased by a similar factor over the four exposures in we present observations of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr b0833 - 45 with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .<n> the observations were carried out as part of the fermi large program in 2006 , with a total integration time of @xmath0 s. the pwn is composed of a large - scale diffuse structure , a compact nebula , and small - scale , collimated emission from a single bright point source at the pulsar position . with the high angular resolution of the acis - s , we were able to resolve the nebulae in individual clumps , as well as the  inner jet ' at the center of the nebula . <n> pulsars are rotating neutron stars with periods ranging from a few milliseconds to a few hours . at the current epoch ,<n> psrs are the most rapidly spinning pulsars known @xcite , but the nature of pulsar winds is still not well understood . in recent years<n> , there has been increasing interest in studying pulsar winds , which are thought to be driven by pulsar - wind interaction and/or magnetic fields . to date , the complex morphology of the p we present a geometry analysis of the young pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in kes 75 observed with the chandra x - ray observatory .<n> the pwn consists of a young pulsar ( @xmath0 ) , two polar jets and several clumps in the surrounding nebula . using a pulsar wind torus fitting scheme , we model the geometry of these features and<n> demonstrate a robust way to measure the underlying pwn geometry . in particular , the highly collimated jet - like feature and its alignment with the nebula symmetry axis strongly suggest its connection to the pulsar polar outflow . for the arc - like features perpendicular to the jet direction , it could be part of a doppler boosted torus or wisp in the equatorial plane . <n> 2e1547.0@xmath13550 2e1655.@xcite 1e1575.@ x -

boosted jets . by fitting the images with a simple model ,<n> we find that the compact clump is more luminous than the southern one , with a de - projected physical size of @xmath0 0.3pc , consistent with the inner and outer tori of the crab . in order to quantify the effect of the doppler boosting on the fit results , we also tried fitting only part of the arc , but we found that the results depend sensitively on a particular region , indicating that the fitting uncertainties are dominated by the systematic errors . <n> the crab is one of the best - studied nearby pulsars @xcite , due to the high luminosity and stability of its spin - down , as well as the long - term and short - term variability in its lightcurve . among the numerous pulsar wind nebulae ( pwns ) discovered by _<n> spitzer  we report the discovery of a new pulsar , b1937 + 21 , with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .<n> the discovery is based on two observations of the pulsar in 2006 , and one observation in 2006 - 2007 , resulting in a combined pulsar and pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 in the 1 - 8kev energy band . in the first epoch ,<n> the pulsar is so bright that the ccd pile - up severely complicates the pulsar count rate measurement , so we estimated the flux from the  out - of - time images ' during the frame transfer time from one row to another . on the first observation , the pulsar spectrum and the luminosity of the compact nebula remain unchanged between the epochs , implying that the pulsar flux has to increase by a factor of 3.5 . excluding the central 3 radius from the pulsar<n> , we find that the overall pwn shows no physical changes between the two epochs and the total flux of the pwn remains unchanged . for the two observations , for a frame time of 1.8s<n> the total unpiled count rate for the pulsar lies in the range of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around sgr a@xmath0 is one of the most interesting objects in the sky .<n> the pwn was observed by the bepposax satellite in 2004 and 2006 , and both observations show evidence for a significant increase in the pulsar luminosity . in this paper , we present the analysis of the 2006 data , which provides the best constraints on the pulsar emission properties in the energy range from 0.5 to 9kev . we find that the spectral and flux variations in the 2006 pwn can be well explained by the luminosity increase , while some small - scale features show significant flux and spectral variations . we report the discovery of a young pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around the crab - like pulsar g21.50.9 .<n> the pwn was discovered in 2006 by the parkes multibeam survey of radio pulsars ( pms ) , and the pulsar identification was made with the _ hst _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acs ) @xcite . with a total flux of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , it is one of the brightest young pwn ever observed . from the two epochs of data , we find that the pulsar flux has increased by a factor of 3 , which is in excellent agreement with the pulsar spin - down rate determined from the pulsar timing . <n> the overall nebula has a relatively soft spectrum , with the spectral index increasing monotonically with the nebular radius , similar to that of other young pwne , including the crab and 3c 58 . in the inner region ,<n> the spectrum softens as one moves to larger scales , while the overall spectrum softens in regions along the symmetry axis . on the other hand , in annular regions , the spectrum is harder than the surrounding we report the discovery of variability in the inner jet of the pulsar b150958 using _ fuse _ observations in 2000 and 2006 . the jet flux doubles in the 2006 observation , which could not be accounted for by the pulsar psf , since the extraction region is small . on the other hand ,<n> the powerlaw index and total luminosity of the clump show no significant change between the two epochs .<n> variability in pulsar jets has been observed among many pwn systems , such as the crab , vela and b 150958 , with timescales from days to years . here<n> , we report on the detection of spectral variations in the clumps , as well as variation in the flux of the inner jets , in the pulsar spectrum and in the surrounding medium . <n> b150978 is a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) system , consisting of a young neutron star ( ns ) , a massive black hole ( bh ) and a pulsar with a moderate mass in the range @xmath0@xmath1 . in the last decade , the system has seen numerous close encounters with the black hole and the pulsar has been associated with a pwn @x we report on the detection of spectral softening in the second epoch of observations of the young pulsar psr j1810@xmath06557 , obtained with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .<n> the pulsar was observed twice , in 2000 and 2006 . in the 2000 observation ,<n> the spectrum was much softer ( @xmath1 ) and the unabsorbed flux increased by a factor of 6 , while in the 2006 observation the spectrum became much softer and the flux only changed by a factors of 4 , suggesting a 6% increase in the observed flux . due to spectral softening , the spectrum of this pulsar in the 0.5 - 10kev range was found to be softer by about an order of magnitude , compared to the spectral index of the first epoch . <n> pulsars are rotating neutron stars ( nss ) , powered by their roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) @xcite , which results in a large spin - down energy , and hence a large emission of gravitational radiation ( gr ) in the energy range of the gev to the tev range . among the pulsars<n> currently known , psrsj1810 we report on the x - ray timing and spectral properties of the accreting millisecond pulsar sgr b1828 + 61 observed with _ rxte _ in 2000 and 2006 .<n> the source was in a spin - down phase at the time of the observations . in the first observation ,<n> the pulsar is not detected and a lower limit of @xmath0ergss@xmath1 in the 1 - 8kev band is placed on the 0.5 - 10kev luminosity . for the first time , no thermal emission from the neutron star is detected . <n> the discovery of a nearby bright pulsar in the field of view of _ xmm - newton _ @xcite , with an accurate timing solution and a moderate redshift , allowed us to perform a deep search for accreted pulsars in the galaxy . among these , s gr b1818 + 61 is of particular interest because of its timing stability , its mass and distance , and its possible connection with the supernova remnant ( snr ) , the so - called planetary nebulae ( pwn ) in the cygnus ob2 association . since its discovery in 1995 , @ the recent hess detection of tev flux from g21.50.9 @xcite suggests a low magnetic field and a low nebular energy density , which are consistent with the pulsar spin - down and nebular evolution scenarios .<n> the nebular x - ray emission extends nearly to the edge of the radio counterpart , suggesting a long synchrotron cooling time scale and hence a weak magnetic field . in the one zone model ,<n> the x - rays and @xmath0-ray fluxes are related to the energy densities of the magnetic field ( @ xmath1 ) and the photons ( @xxmath2 ) , and the fluxes in 0.3 - 5tev range suggest a magnetic field of ( 1.5 - 1.9)@xmath3 ergs , a nebular nebula energy density of ( 2 - 5) times the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) energy density and a synchrotron photon flux of ( 0.5 - 10kev)/(0.3 - 10tev)/(1tev ) = ( 1.6 - 4.0)@ xmath4 erg s@xcite , assuming the tevatron distance is 100kpc . assuming all the photons come from inverse comp we report the discovery of a new pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around the young pulsar sdss j0920 + 0235 .<n> the pwn is elongated in the north - south direction , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula , and has an arc - like feature in the northeast , which we interpret as a toroidal shock . <n> the young age of the system suggests that it is likely to be in the free expansion phase of the nebula . in general , we find that the inferred pressure for the nebula is @xmath0dyne@xmath1 , consistent with the magnetic pressure inside the nebula and the supernova reverse shock having not yet reached the nebula boundary . we report on the first x - ray detection with _ suzaku _ of the outer arc feature in g320.41.2 , powered by psr b150958 .<n> the data were obtained in two epochs separated by @xmath0 years . during the first epoch , the flux of the arc - like feature increased by a factor of @xxmath1 relative to the average flux from the pulsar , while the spectrum became softer . in the second epoch<n> , we detect the arc for the first time , with a flux that is consistent with the average pulsar flux , but with a much higher signal - to - noise ratio . <n> the arc feature , recently discovered by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite , has been interpreted as an equatorial outflow driven by particles flowing with a constant velocity . here<n> we report the first detection of this feature . the arc , located at a distance of about 30@xmath2from the pulsar and with a position angle of approximately _<n> j _ = + 30 degrees , is a bright feature in the spectrum of the g32.00.41.2 pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) we report the discovery of a counter jet in the polar outflow of psr b150958 , the first detection of doppler boosted jets in pulsars other than the crab and the vela . the spectrum of the counter jet is harder than that of its expected counterpart , indicating a large bulk velocity of @xmath0 .<n> the spectral index of the inner jet is consistent with the synchrotron cooling time for particles emitting at 5kev , implying a minimum power input from the pulsar of 1.4% of the total spin - down luminosity , which is comparable to the total luminosity of the pulsar . <n> the polar jets of pulsars are thought to be powered by the outflow of material ejected in pulsar bursts @xcite . in the crab pulsar ,<n> the lack of variability in the jet - like features along the position - velocity diagram ( pwn ) has been interpreted as due to the recent pulsar bursts , while in the pwn of the other pulsars , such as the crab , a variability is expected if the outflow is variable on a timescale of years . here<n> we report on the detection of polar jets in the pulsar psra b150959 , with the _ fer we present an analysis of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of psr b150958 .<n> the x - ray flux has increased by a factor of @xmath0 since the last chandra observation in may 2005 , accompanied by a dramatic increase in the strength of the pulsar s radio emission , which has been accompanied by an order of magnitude decrease in the size of the polar outflow . in the new observations ,<n> the inner and outer jets have been detected for the first time , as well as several faint pwn clumps , all of which are consistent with being the result of interaction between the pulsar and the supernova ejecta . <n> the new data reveal a number of interesting features in the jets , including rapid variability on timescales of a few years , strong spectral variability in the inner jet region , and abrupt terminations at the northern and southern pwn regions . we discuss possible origins for the jets and conclude that they can not be due to doppler boosted motion in the pulsar outflow , mhd instability , particle injection from a shock , or non - thermal emission from the shock interaction with the ambient medium . the recent discovery of we present an x - ray study of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) associated with psr b150958 , using observations with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ in 2000 and 2001 .<n> the pwn consists of several clumps , which are found to be moving away from the pulsar , with a lorentz factor of @xmath0 . in the first epoch ,<n> the spectrum is well - modeled by a power - law with a photon index of 2.0@xmath10.1 , similar to the spectra of other galactic and extragalactic jets . for the second epoch<n> , the spectrum hardens , and the flux measurement indicates a thermal component with a temperature of about 2 kev , probably related to the afterglow of the recent bursts . <n> the pulsar is found in a pwn with several clumps at a distance of about 6kpc , about twice the previously estimated distance , suggesting that the pulsar may be in the process of transition from a rotation - powered to a magnetar - like system , as pointed out by @xcite . the pulsar luminosity in the quiescent state is @x<n> @x we present a detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr j18460258 in kes 75 .<n> the deep chandra observation reveals the axisymmetric structure of the pwn with jet and torus features . from the x - ray emissivity<n> , we deduce an average nebula field @xmath0 g , which is much weaker than the nebular field on a neutron star surface . in the northeast region ,<n> the arc - like structure shows an inclination to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle of @xcite . we interpret this as an equatorial outflow , either a toroidal termination shock or an equatorial wisp . also , from the spatial modeling , the pulsar spin orientation can be inferred from the pulsar s braking index . if this is real , then the spin inclination obtained from the torus fitting indicates a magnetic inclination @x<n> . the non - detection of radio pulsations can be explained in terms of the vacuum - dipole model , if the angle between the spin and magnetic axis is @x . as compared to the crab pulsar , this seems to imply no direct psr j18460258 is the only known example of magnetar - like bursts inside a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . here<n> we report on the long - term x - ray monitoring of this pwn with the chandra observatory from 1996 to 2008 .<n> the pulsar was in a relatively quiescent state during this period , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . during this time , several bursts occurred in the pwn and the luminosity of the pulsar increased by a factor of 6 . in this letter<n> , we present the results of our analysis of the x - rays observed with chandra between 1996 and 2008 , during which time the pulsar luminosity has increased by more than six orders of magnitude , the spectrum of the source has softened and there is an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , which could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : neutron pulsars : general supernova remnants . h.e.s.s . , the high energy stereoscopic system , is a system of two co - spatial , co - temporal , and co - planar , optical telescopes , located at the calar alto observatory in argentina .<n> we present here the first spectral analysis of the system based on the high - resolution , high - cadence data obtained with the system in its quiescent state , from 1996 to 2006 , covering the spectral range of t@xmath0 ev , @xmath1 ev . the analysis is based on a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) constructed from the h - i and h - ii narrowbands and the broad - band photon - counting spectra , which are fitted with a combination of gaussian and power - law functions , respectively , to model the emission from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . in this work<n> , we focus on the spectral properties of the active nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4258 , obtained in quiescence , between 1996 and 2006 . during this time period ,<n> the sdss instrument has provided a spectral coverage millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , millisecond radio pulsars , magnetars , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena .<n> they are powered by very high magnetic fields ( up to @xmath010@xmath1 g ) and are thought to be accelerated by relativistic jets . here<n> we report the discovery of a new class of pulsars whose spin - down luminosity exceeds that of the parent msp by orders of magnitude . the new class , psr b0834 + 06 , consists of two types : ( 1 ) psrs b0836 + 06 and b0833 + 06a , ( 2 ) b1s s and ( 3 ) a new type , b1a s . <n> pulsars with spin periods of 20 ms are believed to be powered by highly relativistic jets @xcite , which are accelerated by magnetic fields of order 10@xcite g. the magnetic energy in the jets is found to be comparable to that in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at the pulsar spin period , indicating that the jets are relativistic , too . in we report on the discovery of an extremely compact ( @xmath0 ) x - ray source , , with a flux density of 3@xmath1 erg @xcite .<n> the source is positionally coincident with the radio galaxy sdss j0827 - 1127 , and has a radio luminosity of about 10 ergs s@xcite and an optical depth of @x.3 . <n> x - rays are produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at relativistic energies , leading to the formation of relativistic jets and relativistic outflows , which are observed in radio and optical images of the sources . in radio<n> images , the relativistic jets are aligned with the line of sight , while in optical images they are displaced with respect to the direction of the jet axis . the relativistic jet ,<n> which is produced by the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the ambient medium , is observed to have a complex structure , consisting of a core , an envelope and a shell , whose properties are studied in this paper . a detailed analysis of the structure of the core and shell is given , as well as the properties of the x we report the results of a 50 ksec _ chandra _ observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 .<n> the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of the source is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath0 kev , or a power - law model with photon index @xcite , and an unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev luminosity of @ xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( 90% confidence errors ) . <n> the spectrum is dominated by a strong 6.4 kev fe k emission line , which we attribute to highly ionized fe ix at the center of the accretion disk , as well as to fe xxv at the outer edge of the disk . we find no evidence for either a soft excess or a thermal component from the source , suggesting that the fe - k line originates from a hot plasma with a temperature kt@xcite or lower . in the literature ,<n> several agn have been found to have strong fe k lines in their spectra , including sgr a * , xte j1550 + 564 , rxte we present a deep , wide - field , adaptive optics ( ao ) image of the ophiuchus nebula , obtained with the adaptive optics system on the 0.9 m subaru telescope .<n> the image covers a total area of @xmath0 arcmin@xmath1 , corresponding to a linear scale of 0.37 arcmin at the point source position , which corresponds to a physical size of 0.36 pc at the assumed distance of 6100 km from the sun . <n> this image is a significant improvement over the previous ao image of this nebula taken in 2006 , as it resolves the compact nebula into two components , the torus and the northern and southern jets , with a brightness temperature of 3700 k and 5100 k , respectively . the northern jet has a higher surface brightness , a lower surface brightness temperature , and a higher volume filling factor , compared to the 2006 image , while the southern jet has the opposite surface brightness and a lower filling factor than the 2000 image . at higher resolution ,<n> the jet is embedded in a larger , diffuse emission structure , indicating that the ionized gas in this nebula is more extended and denser than previously thought . in this work , we report the first measurement of the lorentz force between two parallel plates .<n> the measurement was performed using a fabry <n> perot interferometer , and we show that the force is equal to @xmath0 , where the first derivative of the force with respect to the length of the plate is @x. we also report the measurements of the relative phase between the two plates , as well as the first harmonic of the ratio of the two force to the total force . <n> the fundamental constants of thermodynamics are defined as the sum of the product of the absolute values of temperature and entropy , divided by the number of degrees of freedom of the system . in thermodynamics , the absolute value of temperature is given by the classical formula , while in statistical mechanics , it is defined by the grand - canonical potential , which is the average over the ensemble of systems with the same total entropy . for a fixed total number of systems ,<n> the grand canonical potential is a decreasing function of the total system s _ temperature _ , whereas for a given temperature , its first derivative is proportional to the _ total _ force , denoted by @ we study the clumpy dynamics in the circumstellar envelopes of massive early type dwarf galaxies .<n> we find that the clumpiness is determined by the orientation of the jet axis relative to the line of sight , and is strongly dependent on the mass of the central black hole , which can be controlled by the viewing angle , the orientation angle of the inner jet , as well as the jet orientation angle with respect to the axis of symmetry of the clump . <n> we show that clumpy structure is strongly affected by the presence of an inner jet and inner clump clump in early type galaxies , but it is not strongly influenced by the galactic inclination . the clump clumpiness increases with increasing inclination angle . on the other hand<n> , we find a strong dependence of clump clump size on the inclination angle and find that clump clump sizes increase with galactic latitude , while clump sizes decrease with galactic longitude . we find the clump size distribution is peaked at low inclinations , with clump sizes up to @xmath0 and clump sizes down to a few tens of arcseconds . in early types ,<n> clump size is determined mainly by the inclination of the plane of the sky , whereas in late types it is determined primarily by the we present results of high resolution , high signal - to - noise , polarized x - ray spectroscopy of a highly collimated outflow from the highly supersonic supergiant star ngc 6397 .<n> the velocity field of the outflow was measured with a tpc and a fwhm of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 in the innermost part of the jet , as well as in the outer jet and in the surrounding medium , down to an inflow velocity of about 30 km / s . <n> we show that the inflowing material has a strong longitudinal structure , with a strong outer jet component , and a strong inner counter - jet component which we identify with a circumstellar disk , a jet - like torus and a torus - like envelope . the inner jet component is found to be confined to the inflow cavity , while the outer jets are extended beyond the cavity and are found to propagate through the circumstellar medium with a terminal speed of about 100 km / sec . at the infall velocity of the torus ,<n> the longitudinal structure is well described by axisymmetric , relativistic , spheroidal , disk -

optimal , decision rule is considerably more difficult than devising fs s procedures and this choice is motivated by a number of reasons : it has a very simple structure ; as shown in section [ asym_an_section ] ; detection is the primary interest in many practical applications , so it is natural to adopt the uncoupled strategy , i.e. to test sequentially the in this paper , we consider the class of non - randomized tests , with probability of error of the first and second kind , and propose two decision rules , one sequential and the other fss , in order to estimate the position of the detected event .<n> these two rules can be computed through a dynamic programming algorithm , which is shown to be efficient and robust with respect to the statistical noise introduced by the detector . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the advent of quantum theory , decision making has been one of the central themes in the study of information theory @xcite . among the many decision rules that have been proposed to solve the problem ,<n> the most popular and well - known is the one proposed by shannon and nelson @xmath0 , where the decision rule consists of two steps : ( i ) decide whether a hypothesis is true or false , ( ii ) construct a test statistic , either a map or a test estimator , based on the available information , or ( iii ) make a terminal decision , namely , whether to accept or reject the hypothesis . in the former case , the choice of the estimator is enabled by this paper is devoted to studying wald s sequential test for testing a hypothesis against a simple alternative based on i.i.d . <n> observations .<n> it will be demonstrated that , under rather mild hypotheses , the procedure satisfies also remarkable properties , such as the asymptotic behaviour , when the two error probabilities simultaneously approach zero , and , asymptotically , ( i.e. , every finite moment of the stopping time is first - order asymptotically minimized ) . in particular , it is shown that the sequential test satisfies also properties ( ( [ sprtprop2 ] ) and ( [sprtprop3 ] and ) as the asn is minimized among tests in the class @xmath0 under both hypotheses . in this work , we consider a general class of markov chains with stationary and ergodic transition probabilities .<n> we derive the limiting behaviour of the log - likelihood ratios as a function of the state - space dimension , the number of states , and the exponent @xmath0 of the underlying markov chain . as a consequence ,<n> we show that it is possible to discriminate between statistical populations drawn from these two distributions , i.e. detection could not be possible . <n> _ keywords _ : markov processes , ergodicity , non - gaussian statistics , experimental tests of bell s inequalities , information theory in many areas of science , ranging from biology to cryptography @xcite , it is of crucial importance to be able to detect the presence of correlations between the state of a physical system and its statistical properties . in this context<n> , one of the most important properties is that of  robustness ' : a property which does not depend on the details of the system under investigation , but only on its properties with respect to those of the environment . on the other hand , in the case of non - linear systems , this is no longer optimal tests for the stationary probability and the stationary log - likelihood are derived for binary gaussian initial conditions .<n> these tests are optimal in the sense that they minimize the sum of the test times with respect to the number of auxiliary stopping times needed for the test . <n> optimal tests are of interest in many areas of physics , in particular in the study of the dynamics of complex systems @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider the problem of optimal tests of stationary probability for binary initial conditions in the case of a quantum two - level system , i.e. a system which can be modeled as a superposition of two markov processes , one of which is initially stationary and the other one being initially non - stationary . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce a new test , the _ optimal test _ , which is based on a test of the  stationary probability ' @xmath0 and on a  optimal ' log - probability ratio , defined as the ratio of the log of the initial stationary probability to the value of the stationary one . the optimality of this test is shown to be determined by two parameters , namely the dimension of the space of initial conditions and the in this paper , we propose a test for the non - markovianity of a quantum state .<n> the test is based on the wald - wolfwitz hypothesis of the asymptotic non - negativity ( asn ) , which is the minimum of the test s negativity under two assumptions : ( i ) the state is a pure quantum state and ( ii ) there is an additive noise ( a noise source ) in the system . <n> wald s theorem @xcite is a fundamental tool in the theory of non - classical states of quantum systems . in this theorem ,<n> the asn of a given quantum state is defined as the difference between the negativity of the state and the value of the corresponding quantity of a classical state @xmath0 . as a consequence of this theorem<n> , it is possible to define tests for non - positiveness of quantum states . among these tests , the one proposed in the present paper<n> is particularly interesting : it is the first test of this kind , based on a non - commutative test , that is , a test in which the state of the system is not a pure state and there is no additive noise in the the optimal estimation of the size of a sample from a given set of noisy measurements is an important problem in many branches of science . in this work ,<n> we show how to obtain the optimal tradeoff between the expected sample size and its variance , which is the sum of the variance of the noisy measurements multiplied by the sample size .<n> this tradeoff is optimal up to a logarithmic factor , and optimal down to a sub - optimal power law . <n> optimal estimation is one of the most studied problems in statistics , where the aim is to minimize the error on the estimator of a function of a parameter of interest . for a given noise level , the error is defined as the difference between the value of the estimator and the value obtained from a random walk . as a consequence , in optimal estimation one<n> aims at minimizing the expected variance of a given function of this parameter , i.e. , @xmath0 , over all noise levels @xcite . on the other hand , for noise levels smaller than a certain threshold , one is interested in minimizing the variance over all possible noise levels , namely , from the noisy to the random walk level . to this end , it is this paper is concerned with the design of a new test to detect the position of a target illuminated by a radar system .<n> the proposed test is a linear combination of two markov chains , each associated with a moving target , whose parameters are chosen to minimize the expected signal to noise ratio ( snr ) . <n> the test is designed to be as fast as possible and , thus , to have as low a snr as possible . to this end , the optimal sample size , which is attained when these overshoots are ignored , is determined . as a result<n> , it is shown that this test is optimal in the sense that the sample size must be as small as possible in order to guarantee that the snr attains a minimum as a function of the number of elements used in the test . in the case of radar systems with multiple - resolution elements ,<n> this result is shown to be attained only if the target is allowed to change its position while being illuminated by the radar , a condition which may be too restrictive , especially in airborne applications where the relative radial velocity between target and radar may exceed mach-2 .

dimensional harmonic trap . <n> the subject of this paper is the analysis of brownian particles moving in one dimension under the action of a harmonic potential @xmath0 . in this paper<n> we are interested in the case where the potential is assumed to be harmonic , i.e. it is given by a linear combination of square - well potentials ( swps ) and harmonic oscillators ( ho ) . for this purpose ,<n> we define a new stochastic process by means of a sequence of doubly indexed random variables , and we prove that , under certain conditions , this process has a stationary distribution relative to a shift transformation . the main result is as follows . *<n> introduction : * in his celebrated paper @xcite , brown and heiles showed that the motion of an electron in a harmonic trap can be described in terms of a stochastic process , which they denoted @ in this paper , we introduce a new class of random matrix ensembles , which we call @xmath0 random matrices .<n> they are obtained from i.i.d . <n> stationary distributions of random variables , and , thus , can be considered as a generalization of the well - known gaussian random matrix ensemble ( grmle ) . here<n> , the density of states ( dos ) of these random matrices can be computed exactly , as well as their mean - square displacement ( msd ) and variance . as an application ,<n> we show that the variance of the dos of random matrices of finite size can be expressed in terms of a single parameter , called the _ variance _ of the underlying random matrix , that can be chosen to maximize the variance for a given distribution . in turn , this allows us to calculate the variance in the regime of large but finite sizes of the matrices , i.e. , when the number of underlying random variables tends to infinity . the mean - squared displacement of a random matrix can be defined as the maximum value of the variance over all realizations of the random matrix that satisfy certain conditions . in this paper , we prove that the log - likelihood ratio @xmath0 of a gaussian mixture of uniformly integrable random variables can be expressed as the solution of a convex optimization problem .<n> more precisely , the problem consists in finding , from a given distribution of the random variables , a maximum likelihood estimate for the mean of the distribution . in order to solve this optimization problem<n> , one has to find , among other things , an optimal solution of the optimization problem which minimizes the sum of the variance of the mean and of the likelihood ratio . <n> the aim of this paper is to prove that , in the case of a mixture of random variables with a given probability distribution , this optimal solution is the same as the one obtained from the maximum likelihood ratio of the same random variables @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> we show that the problem of finding the optimal distribution for a given likelihood ratio can be reduced to that of finding a solution of an equivalent optimization problem on the hilbert space of the mixture . this paper is a reply to the letter of @xcite , in which a large deviation result for products of markov random matrices was obtained .<n> the purpose of this reply is to verify the validity of the large deviations result for the transition probability of a markov chain , which was used in the proof of the main result of the paper . to this end , it is first necessary to verify that the condition @xmath0 , under which the process is uniformly ergodic , is fulfilled , i.e. the probability distribution of the initial probability vector is that induced by the vector norm of the process . then it is necessary to prove that , for the markov process , the expectation of the joint distribution of its transition probability and transition matrix is that given by the product of the matrix norm of a product of markovian random matrices . <n> ./style / arxiv -

vmsta.cfg ensemble estimation is a fundamental problem in many branches of science and engineering . in this problem ,<n> an ensemble is defined as the set of all measurements that are required to perform some task , such as a measurement on a single system , or a sequence of measurements on several systems . due to the large number of available measurements @xmath0 , estimation of the ensemble , which is the task of minimizing the ensemble<n> , can be very time - consuming , especially if the number of measurements is small . as a consequence , it is important to consider estimation methods that are easy to implement and that are able to provide an accurate estimate . among the most popular estimation methods are the typical - set ( ss ) estimator @xcite and in this paper , we present a typical set estimator , in which the error probability is proportional to the square of the error rate of the estimator .<n> this estimator can be used to estimate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a noisy channel , even in the presence of additive parametric noise ( aep ) , provided that the snr of the channel is known . <n> pacs numbers : 03.67.-a , 03.65.ud , 89.70.+c _ introduction _ in the field of quantum state estimation , it is important to design estimators that give a correct estimate of the state of a quantum system even when the noise in the system is not a typical sequence @xcite . in particular ,<n> the estimation of the shannon entropy @xmath0 , which is a measure of the degree of entanglement between the system and the environment , is one of the most important and challenging problems in quantum information theory . to this end , there are various estimators , such as the state - space estimators @x , the state-@xmath1 estimators and the generalized estimators for the we derive a family of inequalities relating the asymptotic behaviour of the number of edges in a multiplicative stochastic process to the variance of the stochastic process .<n> the inequalities are derived from the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) principle , which states that a stochastic process is hlder continuous if and only if its variance is bounded by a constant . <n> stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology , and finance . in particular , they play a central role in the statistical mechanics of complex systems @xcite . as such ,<n> they have been the subject of extensive studies , both theoretically and experimentally , over the past two decades . despite their ubiquity , however , there is no consensus on how to relate the statistical properties of stochastic processes to the properties of the underlying complex system . for example , it is well - known that the asymptotic behavior of a large class of processes is determined by the variance @xmath0 of the process , while the asymptotics of other processes are determined by an ensemble of gaussian random variables . on the other hand , in the study of complex dynamical systems , the number @x in this paper , we prove that the error probability of a bell measurement on a two - mode squeezed vacuum state is bounded from above by a constant independent of the state of the system .<n> this result can be applied to characterize the bell state of a pair of entangled qubits . <n> pacs : 03.67.-a , 42.50.dv , 03.65.bz squeezed vacuum @xcite is an important resource for quantum information processing . in quantum information theory ,<n> squeezed vacuum plays an important role , as it is the only possible pure state for the two - qubit register , which is used in quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . as a result of squeezed vacuum entanglement<n> , it is expected that the performance of these protocols can be greatly improved by using squeezed states . however , in practice , squeezed vacuum is noisy , and it is not known whether this noise can be reduced , or even eliminated , by using a suitable coupling between the system and the environment . for this reason , there has been a lot of work on studying squeezed vacuum in the literature . here , the aim of this paper is in this paper , we prove that the number of appearances of discrete memoryless sources ( dms ) that can be used to generate a test result of a _ generalized noiseless system _ is strictly less than that of the _ same problem setup _ in which the system is _ noiseless_. in particular , there is no requirement that the test function used for the generation of the test result be _ continuous _ , i.e. , it can be chosen according to the setting of the conventional group testing . <n> group testing is a well - known testing procedure in classical probability theory .<n> it is based on the idea that an observation consists of a set of @xmath0 random variables that serve as input to a test function ( logical or in the above cases ) , and that a random variable is chosen such that the values of the variables in the set are equal to each other . in the classical theory ,<n> the group testing problem is formulated as the following : given an observation , find a random source of memoryless variables that can produce a corresponding test result . for a given class of test functions , the problem of finding the function that generates the estimation error probability is one of the most fundamental problems in estimation theory . in this paper<n> , we propose a method to estimate the unknown parameters of a physical system from the output of a dynamical model system ( dms ) .<n> the method is based on the gaussian process , which is a generalization of the classical process of estimating unknown parameters from noisy data . by using the method ,<n> we derive a lower bound for the estimation error probabilities of any pair of an @xmath0-pooling graph , a generalized noiseless system , and any system with a lyapunov - type spectrum . <n> [ [ introduction.- ] ] introduction .- + + + - + ++ + +<n> + the estimation of unknown parameters is a fundamental problem in physics , chemistry , biology , finance , as well as in many other fields . to estimate unknown parameters , one needs to estimate a number of physical quantities , such as energy , pressure , momentum , etc . from the input of a system @xcite<n> . then , the system can be estimated from the values of these quantities . for a given physical system<n>  in this paper , we introduce a new class of estimation problems , which we call _ event - based _ estimation .<n> the main idea is to estimate the unknown parameters of an unknown function @xmath0 using only those parameters which are known to be important in the estimation process . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce the concept of _ expectation - based parameter estimation _ ( ebpe ) which is a generalization of the well - known binary group testing . <n> we prove a theorem which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of ebpes in the ensemble ofpooling graphs . as an application of this theorem , in the context of multi - qubit quantum state estimation<n> we show that the error probability of estimation can be made arbitrarily close to zero by properly estimating the values of the parameters of the involved qubit states . in the last decade , quantum information processing ( qip ) has gained a lot of popularity due to the development of efficient quantum algorithms @xcite . among the most important tasks in qip is the estimation of unknown quantum parameters . to estimate unknown parameters one needs to perform a series of measurements on the unknown qubit state , called _ we consider the problem of multipartite entanglement generation by a single - mode bosonic field .<n> the problem is formulated in terms of a generator function whose exponential growth rate can be upper bounded by a constant which depends on the set of possible type vectors in the initial state . in this paper<n> , we derive an upper bound on this constant which is exponentially larger than the coefficient of the generator function in the typical set of type vectors . as a consequence ,<n> we show that it is possible to generate entanglement generation , even if the state of the system is not maximally entangled . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics @xcite . for quantum information processing and quantum cryptography , the generation of entanglement<n> is of crucial importance , as the amount of entanglement that can be produced can be orders of magnitude larger than what can be generated by any classical process . on the other hand , for quantum computation and quantum communication , entanglement is not only an essential resource , but also a necessary condition for the success of the protocols . to fully exploit the potential of entanglement , it is necessary to be able to prepare a maximal amount of entangled states , which is known to be possible only we consider the problem of estimating the intrinsic noise in a system of stochastic oscillators .<n> we show that the error probability can be minimized when the system is gaussian noiseless and when the noise is generated by a set of generator functions that satisfy certain conditions . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- no prior knowledge is necessary to understand the effect of noise on a physical system . in the simplest case ,<n> a physical process is noiseless if it is described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , such as the kolmogorov s equation @xcite or the schrdinger equation ( se ) @xmath0 , where the coefficients of the equation are real , positive , and discrete random variables ( i.e. , stochastic analogs of position , momentum , velocity , time , frequency , amplitude , polarization , phase , etc ) and the system inputs are random variables . for the special case of sdes with real coefficients , _<n> e.g. _ , the shannon s entropy , there is a class of noiseless systems that in this paper , we will discuss the problem of estimating the unknown parameters of a quantum system .<n> the system is assumed to be noiseless , and the problem will be formulated as the estimation of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the system , i.e. , an eigenvalue problem for which no closed form solution is available . <n> estimation of a system s unknown parameters is a fundamental problem in physics , engineering , chemistry , biology , etc . in this problem<n> , it is important to estimate the unknowns , such as the unknown energy , the unknown phase , or the unknown number of constituents . to solve this problem ,<n> it is often necessary to find an estimation method which is easy to implement , has a reasonable computational cost , as well as an achievability condition for the estimation method . as an example , consider the following problem : given two unknowns @xmath0 , their unknowns are to be estimated by a method given in [ achicon , phys . rev . a * 71 * , 042302 ( 2005 ) ] . for the noiseless the shannon limit has been used as a benchmark for the combination of a code and a decoding algorithm , and can stimulate the development of novel reconstruction algorithms . on the other hand , from the analysis presented here<n> , we note a fundamental difference between a group testing scheme and a binary linear error correction scheme .<n> the lower bounds on the estimation error probability , which we proved in this paper , imply that a grouptesting scheme requires a sparse pooling graph or pooling matrix for asymptotically optimal reconstruction . note from an information - theoretic point of view , a dense parity check matrix is desirable for realizing a good linear correction scheme<n> the main contribution of this work is the direct theorems, which give the conditions for achieving arbitrarily small estimation error probabilities . in this paper , we present a new method for the generation of a sequence of pulses in a pulse - pulse interaction system .<n> the method is based on a generalization of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which is a nonlinear , non - linear , mixed - hamiltonian system , and can be implemented in pulse - pulses interaction systems . as a result ,<n> the time dependence of the pulse amplitude can be computed analytically , as well as the pulse shape , pulse width and pulse repetition rate . <n> the main purpose of this paper is to provide a method for generating sequences of pulses with a desired pulse shape and repetition rate in the presence of pulse pulsations . in the field of control , it is important to be able to control the behavior of the system under consideration , in particular , its pulse dynamics . for this purpose<n> , there is an increasing interest in the development of nonlinear control methods for the manipulation of pulse amplitudes , pulses and their repetition rate @xcite . among the different nonlinear control approaches , one of the most widely used methods is the time- and frequency- dependent schdinger equation , @",

normal distribution with mean radius of 5 @xmath0 m , and another where particle sizes are prescribed to be log -normal distributions with mean radii of 4 @xcite . in both cases ,<n> the atmosphere has solar abundance ; here we choose the latter model . for the cloud model , we find that the particle mean radius must be less than about 4@xmath1 m for the solar abundance model ; for the gas model the mean particle size must be about 5@xcite m . with these choices<n> we are able to compute light curves for a wide range of cloud particle sizes and atmospheric parameters . at the highest temperatures and pressures expected for high -

gas giant planet ( cegp )  a tidally distorted planet in a tight orbit around a star can distort the star s light curve at the micromagnitude level .<n> we examine the effect of a tidalally distorted planet on the observed scattered light curve , assuming an isothermal expansion and equilibrium . in this paper<n> , we estimate the distortion of the star - planet - observer angle due to the tidal distortion of a close - in giant planet , and compare it with the effect from a non - expanding gas - giant planet of the same mass . <n> the scattered light from a star with an orbiting planet is a direct probe of the physical properties of the planet ; it is , therefore , an excellent tool to study its interior , as well as its interior dynamics , in a planet - bearing environment . at the millimagnitude level ( @xmath0 ) ,<n> the light curve is dominated by the light from the primary star , while at the nanomagnitude level the secondary star may be obscured by the influence of the orbiting planet ( drake 2003 ; drake 2004 )<n> . however , at the atomic level , the light scattered by a planet can be used to constrain its interior properties , such as cegps are expected to be tidally locked due to tidal interactions between the planet and the star ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; guillot et al .<n> 1966 ) . the stellar atmosphere may also be affected by tidal interactions with the cegp . combined with the back scattering of light from the planet<n> , the stellar atmospheric atmospheres could potentially have a flux hot spot with a rotational variation of the same period as the planet s rotational period . to investigate the magnitude of the back heating effect we construct an approximate model , based on the results of the monte carlo code . one of the fundamental limiting factors in the spectroscopic detection of extrasolar planets through doppler shifts is the intrinsic radial velocity noise due to the changing pattern of rising granules at the top of the convection zone .<n> the variation in filling factor and contrast of the granulation pattern is also an important noise source in ultra - precise photometry of solar - type stars . to simulate this noise source , we generate a grid of frequencies from zero to the nyquist frequency appropriate to the simulated data sample . from this grid ,<n> we invert the values to create an array of @xmath0 values , and then generate a sample of data from which we extract frequencies from the grid . <n> the sample , selected for doppler searches for extra solar planets tend to be chromospherically quiescent , so the targets for most photometry will also share that trait . however , granulation noise may still be the dominant noisesource , especially at low frequencies . in this paper<n> we present monte carlo simulations of radial velocity and photometric time series data sets from the coronagraphic extrasolar planet project ( cegp ) , which is a new ground - based doppler planet search program . for each star in the granulation in the photosphere of the sun is the dominant source of noise in ground - based photometry of solar - type stars at optical and near -

perturbative phenomena in condensed matter physics . in recent years<n> a great deal of work has been devoted to the study of susy in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite . among various susy theories ,<n> the one based on the concept of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( es ) model is generating a lot of interest , because it is the simplest susy model which can be realized in a wide range of physical systems , from cold atoms to superconductors , and from mesoscopic systems to condensed matter ones . from a theoretical point of view<n> the es model is very useful because it provides us with certain relation between potential and mass functions , which are the ingredients producing an es - model . for instance , claiming we introduce a class of supersymmetric ( si ) hamiltonians for two - component fermions with arbitrary potential .<n> we show that these supersymmetric partners can be used to realize the ssusy effect , i.e. , a superposition of two s - wave states separated by a gap , in a solid state setup . <n> _ introduction _ the study of quantum phases of matter is one of the most active areas in modern physics . in condensed matter physics<n> there is a growing interest in systems with exotic quantum properties , such as superconductivity , superfluidity , and supersolidity @xcite . among these exotic phases ,<n> the _ s_-wave superconductors ( ss ) are among the most fascinating , both theoretically and experimentally , as they exhibit a number of intriguing properties . for instance , they are predicted to be superfluids in the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of a s superconductor , with a critical temperature @xmath0 , below which the system undergoes a second - order phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator @x<n> . moreover , in this paper , we investigate the spectral properties of non - hermitian hamiltonian systems .<n> in particular , in the framework of ssusy scheme , which is an extension of the well - known no - go theorem for hermitian quantum systems , it is shown that the spectrum of such system may be completely characterized by a finite set of levels , each of which can be analytically obtained in a closed analytic form . as a consequence ,<n> the zero modes of these levels may be identified . <n> _ introduction _ <n> the study of wave functions and spectra in quantum systems has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in general<n> , the wave function and the spectra are related to each other by the symmetries of the system . however , this is not always the case , for instance , when the wave functions are given by hermitian operators @xmath0 , or when the spectrum is given by singular oscillatory ( si ) conditions , as for instance in the case of quantum hall effect , these are not necessarily the same as the corresponding spectra given by the standard gaussian conditions . moreover , even when the spectra we present a new extended schrdinger ( es ) model of electrons in a double - well potential .<n> the hamiltonian is extended in such a way that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the es model are normalizable in the em framework . in the present model ,<n> the si condition is not only satisfied at the center but also at the two sides of the well . <n> _ introduction_. the study of electron ( electron ) transport in double well potentials ( dwps ) is one of the most active areas of the condensed matter physics , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . due to the large number of parameters involved , it is not easy to find a model which satisfies all the necessary conditions for a given system , and so it is desirable to find models which can satisfy some of the conditions for the system . among the models , the extended schdinger ( ess ) models are very useful in this respect , because they can be solved analytically in the limit of small number of wells and also satisfy all the conditions required for the existence of normalizability of the wave functions . however , in the case of dwp  we propose a theoretical model of extended states ( es ) , which is a generalization of the schrdinger equation ( sde ) to extended states .<n> the resulting hamiltonians are obtained by using the method of exact diagonalization ( ed ) and are shown to be able to describe a wide range of physical phenomena , such as superconductivity , superfluidity , non - fermi liquid behavior , high-@xmath0 superconductors , colossal magnetoresistance , quantum hall effect , etc . <n> the proposed es model may be used to construct a new class of models of condensed matter systems . in this article<n> we present a theoretical approach to construct es models , based on an extended state ( ess ) formalism @xcite , in order to describe ( i ) the superfluid ( sf ) phase transition of a s - wave superconductor ( sc ) in the presence of strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , ( ii ) a superconductor - normal metal ( sc - nm ) transition , and ( iii ) quantum hall effects ( qhes ) of the es we study the nature of the wave functions associated with a mass system which is singular or non - singular depending on the value of the mass parameter .<n> we show that for a mass function which is strictly positive definite everywhere and approaches a constant value 1 at both infinity , the physical wave functions tend to those associated with harmonic oscillator . for a weakly attractive singularity ( @xmath0 ) , on the contrary , they tend to vanish at infinity according to the boundary conditions . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.-w , 05.30.-d , 32.80.pj 2 recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of wave functions of mass systems . in refs . @xcite<n> it has been shown that the wave function associated with the mass system is always positive definite and that its value at infinity is 1 , while at infinity it is 1 for all other values of mass . as a consequence ,<n> the corresponding potential is singular if the mass is negative definite . on the other hand , for a positive - definite mass system<n> , it is possible to have a potential which is bistable and for a non - negative mass it is a we study the dynamics of a quantum particle confined in a singular oscillator well .<n> the well confining the particle is divided into two zones by a high thin barrier at the center . for weakly repulsive case<n> this barrier is penetrable by a quantum - mechanical particle . <n> [ [ section ] ] it is well known that a harmonic oscillator ( well ) can be singular ( singular , es ) by introducing an inverse - square singularity in the potential . in this work<n> we have shown that for repulsive singularity ( @xmath0 ) , the quantum particle can also be confined in singular well , but physically it is separated from the well by a thin barrier . to do this , we have introduced self - adjoint extensions ( si ) of the hamiltonian , wherein the potential and the mass are related according to a second order si condition , which we show to be factorizable up to a constant shift . here<n> we wish to show that the same system could be studied through first order si formalism . we study the ground state properties of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model with type ii supersymmetry ( susy ) and factorizability restrictions on the hamiltonians .<n> it is shown that the type ii reduction of susy in 1d leads to a new class of gapless fermions with non - abelian braiding statistics . in this paper<n> we study a 1d hubbard hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is obtained by reducing the number of parameters of the first order superpotential , in order to have a zero energy ground state . for this purpose<n> we use the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method . <n> [ [ section ] ] in refs . @xcite , we have studied the ground states properties of 1d and 2d supersymmetric hubbard models in the framework of type ii and type i reduction of the superpotentials , as well as the factorizabilities restrictions . here<n> we are mainly interested in the case when the supersymmetry is broken only by the interaction with the fermionic degrees of freedom , while the other parameters are kept fixed , such as the interaction strength , the we have proposed a new approach for constructing hamiltonians with position - dependent mass function .<n> the approach is based on symanzik s second order supersymmetric ( 2-susy ) theory , which is generalized to include position - dependence . in the present approach<n> , we have derived a compact expression of position -dependent mass function in terms of 2-sousy potentials . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of quantum mechanics has gained a lot of importance in the recent years , due to the growing interest in the field of quantum information ( qi ) @xcite . among the various approaches ,<n> supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite is the most popular and widely used , because of its simplicity , flexibility , and applicability to a wide range of problems in quantum mechanics . however , in spite of its popularity , susy suffers from the problem of silicon ( si ) constraint , namely , the requirement of being in perfect agreement with the requirements imposed by the law of conservation of energy . to overcome this drawback , a number of schemes have been proposed in the literature , such as the schrdinger ( sm )  in this work we investigate a class of hamiltonians , which possess second order shape - invariance , by means of @xmath0-fold supersymmetric ( susy ) approach for ladder operators .<n> we obtain their wave functions and energy eigenvalues , and compare them with those of the corresponding hamiltonian obtained via standard methods for arbitrary potential and mass functions . <n> [ [ section ] ] in ref . @xcite we have presented a method , based on ssusy scheme , to obtain the energy - eigenfunctions and the corresponding wave functions for a large class of electromagnetic ( em ) quantum systems . in the present work we generalize the idea of shape invariance ( si ) to the second order susy ( ss ) scheme . as an example<n> , we investigate algebraic potentials with second order si condition , for which we obtain the corresponding schrdinger ( sm ) and super - sm hamiltonies , as well as the corresponding ground - state energy and wave function . we propose a new method for the calculation of the entanglement entropy of a quantum state .<n> the method is based on the symmetrization of the wave function of the state , rather than its entanglement with the environment as in usual quantum mechanics . as an example<n> , we consider the case of a spin-@xmath0 two - level system in contact with a thermal bath . <n> entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics ( qm ) @xcite . in the non - relativistic case ,<n> the amount of entanglement present in the system is determined by the state of the system , while in the relativistic case it is given by the reduced density of states ( dos ) , i.e. , the probability that the state is in a maximally entangled state with respect to the other states . for a system with a large number of particles , @xmath1 , it is natural to ask how much entanglement is present between the system and the environment , if one is interested in the entanglement of the whole system . to answer this question , one has to consider the following question : what is the maximal set of states that can be in maximal entanglement with each",

interacting and gravitationally bound to the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) @xcite . for dm to be consistent with the observations it is necessary that dark matter is not more than a few percent of the total energy budget in the form of hot dark matter . to explain the we present a model for the formation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from the accretion of dark matter ( dm ) halos with masses in the range of @xmath0@xmath1 .<n> the model is based on the idea that the igm volume filling factor is dominated by the galactic outflows from these halos . in our model<n> the dm halos are assumed to follow a power -

[ section ] [ theorem]corollary the problem of characterizing the set of all possible circuits on a circuit is central to circuit theory and its applications @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider the following problem : what is the smallest possible hyperplane that is a fundamental flat of a circuit ?<n> this problem is of interest in its own right , but it is also relevant to the study of circuit theory in more general settings , such as circuit description theory ( ct ) and its application to circuit - based quantum computation . to answer the question ,<n> we construct a new set of fundamental flats of a we prove that there are only two pnc - flats @xmath0 , and both are circuits : the first is a spanning circuit , the second is a line with four points .<n> we also show that the minimal spanning circuit of the first flat is uniform . <n> the notion of a pnc is introduced in @xcite , where it is shown that the set of all pnc flats is finite . in this<n> setting , pnc flatness is defined as the property that the only flats of a given set are uniform nested matroids ; in this context , matroid flatness was introduced by s. srensen in his proof of the uniform flatness of the real line , which is based on the fact that all matroid flats of the line are uniform ; here , non - uniform matroid - flats are defined as those sets that are uniform in the following sense : every matroid is the union of two nested circuits . as a consequence ,<n> any flat can be decomposed into a uniform set , with each uniform set being the minimal flat of the set ; the uniform set is called the pnc . for a flat , it is we prove that a quantum circuit in @xmath0 can not be a circuit - hyperplane dual of a finitely connected one . <n> the notion of a _ quantum circuit _ , introduced by andruskiewitsch @xcite , is a generalization of a classical circuit .<n> it is defined in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum operator , and is related to the commutation relations of quantum mechanics . in its simplest form<n> , the quantum circuit is a linear superposition of finitely many non - commuting circuits , each connected to the rest of the world . for a finite number of possible connections ,<n> the quantum circuits can be parametrized by their eigenvalue spectrum , which is a function of the connectivity of the circuit ; in other words , they can be viewed as sets in the space of all possible connections between the world and the circuits . a circuit is _<n> non - commutative _ if there is no direct connection between any two of its components in the same way as there is any non - trivial connection between the components of the same circuit in the world - wide - web ( www  for a connected deletion @xmath0 , a connected matroid , and a deletion connected to a connected interval , it is shown that the connected deletions are either isthmus of the matroids or of the interval itself , or , in the latter case , pnc - flat . <n> flatness is a fundamental property of quantum theory .<n> the flatness of a quantum circuit is in general not a property of the circuit alone , but of its set of spanning circuits . in this paper<n> , we consider the question of which flatness properties of quantum circuits can be characterized by means of flatness theory , which was developed by anderson in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . to a flat quantum circuit<n> is said to be a fundamental flat of the corresponding quantum matroid or deletion . for a matroid and deletion ,<n> the following statements are true : [ lem : ff1 ] for any connected deletion and any fundamental flat , there is a spanning circuit of the deletion that spans the deletion and is itself a flat of its connected deletion ; for a single - element extension , the set of spans of the deleted circuit is a in this paper , we show that if @xmath0 is a reducible intersection of two finitely connected pnc - flats , then the intersection of the two flats is always connected .<n> more precisely , the following is shown . <n> 1 . for a reducibility condition on a flat , it is well - known that its intersection is always a connected component of itself . however , if the condition is not satisfied , there is no connection between the two intersections . in this work ,<n> we show this is not the case . we prove that for a given condition , every reducability condition is equivalent to the following three conditions : [ lem : staycon ] for the first two conditions , let @xcite be the set of all reduccible intersections of finitely many riemann - hilbert ( r - h ) flats of a given dimension . then for each reducosity @x<n> , consider the intersection @x , which is the intersection between the reduccessing flats @ x and y , and the set , denoted by _<n> t _ , of all non - zero reduc we show that a path order @xmath0 in a given irreducible pnc - flat is in a spanning circuit .<n> more precisely , we show the following : 1 . <n> if there is a reducible preprojective - flat in a connected two - level system ( 2 ) , then the path order in the corresponding spanning circuit is a basis of the preprojection . in this case<n> , there is no spanning circuit in the two - dimensional system . 2 . the irreducibility of a path - order - flat ( pnc ) in a 2-dimensional system is a fundamental property of the system ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the classification of pncs in 2-dimensional systems . for a given path order ,<n> a pnc is a topological flat , defined by : ( 1 ) the property that every basis of a spanning circuits is contained in some pnc of the corresponding path order and ( 3 ) a basis in the circuit order of the pnc contains the first element in that path order<n> . [ thm]corollary of the notion of a fundamental pnc flat ( fpt ) @x we prove that matroids in @xmath0 with three fundamental flats are impossible . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem][ theorem]corollary it is well - known that any compact matroid in the complex plane , i.e. , any rational matroid @xcite , has at least three topological invariants : the fundamental flat , which is the fundamental invariant of the base , and two additional fundamental flats , one connected and the other not connected .<n> the notion of a fundamental flat was first introduced by john von neumann in his work on the riemann zeta function . in his seminal work<n> , von nieminen showed that a compact , rational , matroid can have any number of fundamental flats of any base . as a consequence ,<n> there is no matroid with more than two fundamental flats in the real plane . on the other hand , in his later work , thurston showed that the existence of more than three fundamental flat in the plane is equivalent to the fact that the base is cyclic , that is , the flat is the union of the flat we prove that @xmath0 is the unique irreducible representation of a circuit on the real line , up to isomorphism .<n> we also prove that the irreducibility is preserved under local operations and classical communication . <n> let @xcite be a circuit with @x , _<n> i.e. _ , the number of non - zero eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix of the state of the circuit . in this paper<n> , we consider circuits with up to three eigenstates , or , more generally , circuits with arbitrary number of states . here<n> we deal with the case when the reduced densities of states of the circuits are real , that is , when they are not integer multiples of one another . for an example of this , see refs . [<n> s : circuit ] and [ cor : eigenstate ] , respectively . a circuit is said to be unique if it can be uniquely determined from the properties of all of its states ; in other words , if it is unique , then its properties are completely determined by its state of each of the states  we show that the smallest fundamental flat of a matroid @xmath0 has at least two incomparable sets .<n> in particular , we prove that the set of all uniform matroids with @math1 is a subset of the smallest ( but possibly incomparable ) fundamental flat . <n> the notion of a  fundamental flat '' ( pnc ) was introduced by john von neumann in his proof of the hausdorff conjecture @xcite , which is one of the main motivations for the theory of quantum chaos . in pncs ,<n> a set is called a fundamental flat if it is the smallest possible fundamental flat for the underlying hilbert space . the _ smallest _<n> fundamental flat is a set of integers , and it is natural to ask whether it is possible to count the number of fundamental flats of a given matroid by counting its incomparable sets ( or , equivalently , its circuits ) . a well - known counterexample to this is provided by thurston , who showed that the only incomparable sets are the circuits of the underlying matroid . here<n> we will show that there are incomparable sets that are not fundamental flats , even though they are incomparable fix a fundamental flat @xmath0 of a ring . we show that the smallest fundamental flat of the ring that is not a hyperplane is a pnc - flat , and that the fundamental flats of all the other comparable fundamental flats that are not hyperplanes form a chain .<n> we also show that there are infinitely many infinitesimally thin rings with the same fundamental flats . <n> the notion of fundamental flats was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in the context of the riemann problem , which is the study of the topology of the set of all real , positive integer , fundamental flats on a ring of characteristic zero . in this paper<n> , we consider the problem of finding the smallest ( in fact , the largest ) fundamental flat that is contained in all the comparable ( in the sense of pnc theory ) other fundamental flats in the ring ; this problem is closely related to the well - known alexander - vlasov - poincar - nelson ( avp ) problem of defining the minimal fundamental flat in a ring that contains all its other fundamental flat . to this end , first we describe all fundamental flats contained in the smallest possible fundamental flat we show that the disjoint union of two disjoint fundamental flats is not necessarily disjoint .<n> we also show that a disjoint set is incomparable if and only if it is a pnc - flat . <n> [ theorem]corollary this paper is concerned with disjoint sets that are not necessarily incomparable @xcite . in @xmath0<n> , we say the set of elements is disjoint if the elements of the set are disjoint and the union of the elements is incomparable . since the dis joint union of any pair of fundamental flats of a finite dimensional hilbert space is incomparable ( i.e. , disjoint but not incomparable ) ,<n> it is natural to ask whether this property also holds for arbitrary sets . to answer this question , it is useful to consider disjoint subsets of a set , called fundamental flats , since they are the only sets for which disjointness is guaranteed ( see , for example , [ cor : notlpm ] )<n> . however , no such set is known , and it is not clear how to determine whether a given set is a fundamental flat or not . here<n> we prove that disjoint we prove that the lpmchar - gauss inequality is equivalent to a generalized version of the novikov - shapiro - shimony - holt ( nss ) theorem .<n> we do this by showing that the pnc - flat property is not equivalent to any of the other two properties . <n> [ theorem]corollary in this paper , we prove a result that was conjectured by two of the authors @xcite . in the theorem<n> , it is assumed that @xmath0 is a flat set in the space of real numbers , which is equivalent , in a certain sense , to the flatness of the reals . here<n> we show that this assumption is not necessary , as long as one can show that the set of reals is either a pnc or a flat . to do this ,<n> we prove the following : 1 ) we prove , using a result of szapudi et al . @x<n>cite , that if a real number is a riemann surface , then it can be embedded into the space in such a way that its eigenvalues are real , and 2 ",

called fano effect , i.e. , the appearance of two peaks in the extinction spectrum of a single particle when it is resonantly coupled to a superposition of other particles in the same wavevector space as it is quantized . recently , there has been a great deal of interest in observing fano effects in a variety of physical systems , such we report on the existence of double fano resonances in a tripod metamaterial system , which is realized by using a layered metamaterial composed of a dielectric material with a double - well - defined resonance and a dielectric substrate .<n> we find that near - field couplings of two superradiant oscillators , @xmath0 , in the dielectric material , and a subradiant oscillation , , to a common oscillator in the substrate give rise to a fano dip wider than that in a single resonance in region . in the extinction spectra of the composite metamaterial , these coherent effects show up as an energy transfer from low - energy oscillator to high - energy one . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , there has been a great deal of interest in using metamaterials as building blocks in photonic circuits @xcite . among various metamaterial systems , tripod metamaterials<n> have attracted particular attention because of their unique properties , such as double - fano ( dsrr ) resonances . here<n> , we show for the first time that a double dsr resonance can be realized in a metamaterial with a tripod structure , even though it is a single - well we report on the plamonic excitations of a subradiant mode in a composite metamaterial , which is composed of a @xmath0-@xmath1 anti - bonding - hybridization - anti - parallel metamaterial and a bonding - antibonding - hybridization metamaterials .<n> we show that fano dip takes place at the frequency 1.6thz in the excitation spectrum , similar to double fano resonances reported in refs . <n> @xcite , and the induced dipole is significantly suppressed by a coherent coupling with the anti - bonded metamaterial due to the hybridization of dipoles placed side - by - side , giving rise to the fano dips in the spectrum of the subradiance . in the analysis , we provide the electric field distribution , normal to the planar metamaterial surface , in order to clarify the excitation of subradiants in the metamaterials and clarify the charge distributions of the excitations , thereby , clarifies the plasmon excitations in planar metamaterials as a whole . recently , there has been a great deal of interest in plamonics@xcite which is based on the interaction of light and matter . while the interaction between two or more atoms or molecules we theoretically investigate the fano mode excitations in ferromagnetic resonance ( frr ) of @xmath0-type transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) based on the density functional theory ( fdtd ) .<n> we find that double fano resonances with asymmetric fano shapes exist in tmb@xmath1 , where superradiant mode dipolar excitations are suppressed by a near - field coupling with a ferromagnetic insulator . by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method ,<n> we show that the multipolar nature of fano excitations originates from a coherent coupling with the quadrupole excitation in two parallel rods . <n> magnetoresistance ( mr ) is one of the most powerful tools to investigate the electronic structure of materials @xcite . in particular<n> , it is essential to understand the origin of superradiance , which is a hallmark of the unconventional superconductivity observed in the cuprate superconductors . on the other hand , frr<n> is a key element for understanding the superfluidity in the manganites and strontium titanates ( mtt ) @x by embedding four - rod resonators inside double - split ring resonators superlattice , a composite metamaterial system is introduced , where a common subradiant oscillator in four - rods resonator is coupled with two superradiant dipoles in double - splits ring resonator , to give rise to double fano resonances . as a classical analogue of four - level tripod atomic system , the extinction spectrum of the composite metamaterials exhibits a coherent effect due to the conjugation of two coupling strengths , @xmath0 and @ x , which shows up as a transfer of absorbed power from one superradiants dipole to the other superradints dipoles , whose coupling strengths are , , and , respectively .<n> double fanon resonances are correlated owing to the coupling of two strengths . <n> coherent plasmonic resonances in nanoscale structures have been the focus of intensive research efforts in recent years , as they can be utilized in designing coherent effects in metamaterials @xcite . in particular ,<n> fano plasmons are of great interest for their potential applications in quantum information processing , quantum phase transitions in condensed matter physics , etc .. in this paper<n> , we we report a plasmonic analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) based on the fano resonance in a planar metamaterial structure .<n> we demonstrate that the eit can be enhanced by introducing dual excitation pathways of the dark mode , which leads to double fano - type resonances with high sensing sensitivity . <n> electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( emt ) @xcite has been widely used for enhancing the sensing sensitivity of terahertz ( thz ) electromagnetic waves . in this analogue method ,<n> the transparency of a metamaterial is induced by the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the source @xmath0 , and is thus directly related to the electric and magnetic plasmon modes of the metamaterial , respectively . by tuning the coupling between the two modes<n> , the emt can be increased from the drude limit to the full transparency limit . as a result , in a device - independent way , eit has been shown to be useful for increasing the sensitivity of various electromagnetic wave - sensing applications , such as optical sensing , gravitational wave detection , optical modulators and transistors . however , due to the low transparency of the original emt the fano effect , i.e. , the optical response due to multiple fano resonances , is one of the most fascinating phenomena in the field of plasmonics .<n> recently , fano - assisted optical phase gates have been demonstrated in various systems , such as meta - atoms , three - dimensional plasmon rulers , and artificial hybrid molecule systems . in this paper , we show that double electromagnetically induced transparency can be used to control the phase gate operation in a multi - level meta - atom system , which is a significant step towards the realization of a multispectral phase gate . <n> optical phase gate based on the interaction of light with matter has been a subject of intense research in the last two decades @xcite . among various schemes ,<n> the one proposed by liu _<n> et al._@xcite in 2011 is the plasonic version of the matched -

ring metamaterial absorber ,<n> we find that the two amplitudes of the radiation can be modulated in opposite directions , which can be used to switch the absorber s spectral profile . <n> terahertz metamaterials ( tms ) are the building blocks of terahertz devices @xcite , and have received significant attention from both the fundamental science and the applied science communities in recent years . among many terahertz - based devices , a particularly active one is the metamaterial - based fano resonance ( fr ) device , in which the fano line shape and phase reversal can be changed by changing the amplitude of a photon @xmath0 , e.g. , changing the redshift of the resonance we present a new theoretical framework for the study of fano resonances in plasmonic nanostructures and metamaterials , based on the concept of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) .<n> we show that the fano effect , i.e. the interference of far - field and near - field fano - like plasmon resonances , originates from the interplay between configuration interaction and the eit induced transparency , and that it can be used to characterize the structure at the angstrom scale . <n> [ [ section ] ] one of the most fundamental principles of classical electrodynamics is the well - known fano principle @xcite , which states that the amplitude of a photon s transmission through a medium is proportional to the intensity of that medium s electromagnetic field , @xmath0 . in the case of plas monic nanostructures ,<n> this principle has been extensively studied in the literature , giving rise to a large body of work on directional double - fano ( dfn ) resonances @x<n> . however , the fundamental connection between the far - fields and the near - fields of these resonances has not been fully understood , despite the fact that plasmonic autoionization resonances and dark plasmons in metallic nanostructures are investigated when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are externally driven .<n> it is shown that the characteristic asymmetric line shape of fano resonances is retained in the excitation spectra , where a sequence of constructive and destructive interferences between continuum and discrete resonances takes place . in - phase and out - of - phase interferences depend on whether the discrete resonance falls on the red or blue side of the background continuum resonance , and the asymmetric fano line shape is characterized by 3 parameters , the resonance shift and the resonance width . differently from a dark mode in atomic spectroscopy ,<n> there exits an intrinsic non - radiative joule loss in a plamonic dark mode when electromagnetically driven , giving rise to a modulation damping parameter @xmath0 , a measure of the decrease in fano contrast . <n> * introduction.*@xmath1 in recent years , non -

uniform distribution of angular momentum , leading to a variety of non - trivial phenomena , such as the appearance of vortices in the dispersion relation of a rotating particle , the emergence of the kerr effect , or the stabilization of a nanorotor under the action of a static magnetic field ( see , for example , refs . and references therein ) . to understand these effects ,<n> it is of interest to study the dynamics of nanoparticles under the influence of thermal noise , in particular , when the we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the steady - state dynamics of nanospheres under the influence of a precessing magnetic field . in the noiseless case ,<n> the angular frequency of precessional rotation of nanoparticles coincides with the magnetic field frequency , and the @xmath0-component of the reduced nanoparticle magnetization is given by the equation of motion .<n> however , in the presence of a thermal torque , the reduced angular frequency is essentially determined by the nonlinear thermal fluctuations . as a consequence , thermal fluctuations can not only increase and decrease the frequency of rotation , but also reduce it as compared with the deterministic case . <n> _ introduction._@xmath1 nanoparticles are used in a variety of technological applications , such as sensing , optical , mechanical and chemical processing , as well as energy conversion . to achieve these goals , it is essential to understand the microscopic mechanisms underlying their motion , which can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) nanoparticles are typically modeled as point - like objects with a well - defined shape , characterized by a number of internal degrees of freedom , ( 2 ) the motion of nanoparticles is subject to thermal noise , i.e we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the precession of a classical particle in an external magnetic field .<n> specifically , we consider the noiseless case , i.e. , @xmath0 , and show that the average frequency of precession monotonically decreases with increasing temperature , while the reduced magnetization exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on the magnetic field frequency . moreover , due to thermal fluctuations , the characteristic frequency that separates the regimes of monotonic and non -monotonic dependence of the reduced angular frequency on the magnetization is non - zero . <n> the study of the dynamics of classical particles in a static magnetic field has a long history , which can be traced back to the work of maxwell and boltzmann @xcite on the wave equation of motion of a particle in a uniform magnetic field ( see fig . [ m_z ] ) . since then , a great deal of work has been done on classical particle dynamics in various fields , such as optics , acoustics , condensed matter , kinetics , fluid dynamics , thermodynamics and more recently in the field of nanoparticles . in this field<n> , there has been a great we have studied both analytically and numerically the rotational properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticle in a viscous fluid driven by a precessing magnetic field .<n> our approach is based on the system of multiplicative langevin equations for the polar and azimuthal angles of the nanoparticle magnetization frozen into the massless nanoparticle . from these equations , approximating the cartesian components of the random torque by gaussian white noises and interpreting them in an arbitrary way , we have derived the corresponding fokker - planck equation . by associating the stationary solution of this equation with the boltzmann probability density ,<n> we have established that the basic system of langevin equation should be interpreted in the stratonovich sense , and have reproduced the known system of effective lennard - jones equations . within this framework , the statistical properties of its solution do not depend on the interpretation of multi plicative white noises . using the corresponding system of effectively langevin and fokkers , _<n> i.e. _ , by interpreting the random noise as a random force acting in the @xmath0-direction and interpreting it as a stochastic force with an arbitrary strength and distribution , as well as the the influence of thermal fluctuations on the rotational dynamics of nanoparticles is investigated by numerical integration of the system of effective langevin equations .<n> the most remarkable property of the above mentioned quantities is that their sum is strictly equal to 1 ( in dimensionless units ) for any rotating field . in the latter case , when the steady - state rotation of nanoparticles has the precessional character , we have derived a general expression for the nanoparticle magnetization and have observed that the frequency of nanoparticle precession always coincides with the rotating field frequency . using these equations , a number of interesting thermal effects have been observed , in particular , it has turned out that the deterministic regime of rotation , which exists when a constant magnetic field is infinitesimally small , is completely destroyed by thermal fluctuations . macroscopic quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment ( mqt ) of a point - like object has been proposed as a mechanism for the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) observed in a variety of magnetic materials .<n> however , this tunneling mechanism has not been observed in any experiment so far . here<n> , we report the first experimental observation of mqt in a self - assembled magnetic structure , consisting of a nano - magnet with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . by measuring the magnetoresistance of the structure as a function of the applied magnetic field ,<n> we show that the observed mqt phenomenon can be understood in terms of the interplay between quantum and classical fluctuations of the magnetization in the structure . <n> the discovery of magnetoresistance in 1963 by berkowitz et al . in their seminal work @xcite has triggered a tremendous amount of activity in the study of giant mqt phenomena . over the last half - century , a wide variety of materials have been used to demonstrate the existence of a giant magnetoresistive effect@xcite , such as cu - co alloys , fe - based superconductors , cu - based thin films , pt / pt junctions , heterogeneous systems  single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , single - domain magnetic molecules , superparamagnetic fms , and magnetic nano platforms are major players in the nanosciences and medicine .<n> however , the chemistry , synthesis , physicochemical characterizations and applications of these systems are not well understood . here<n> , we address this issue by reporting a comprehensive suite of synthesis and characterization techniques for fm - based nanoparticles , including the optimization of the shape , size , shape stability , surface chemistry and composition , as well as the characterization of the magnetic energy surface , electronic structure , charge and magnetic localization . <n> * introduction : * nanoparticles are the building blocks of a wide range of nanodevices and materials , such as sensors , actuators , magnetic multi - components , magnets , nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems)@xcite , microelectromechanical devices ( mems,@xmath0 ) and magnetic random access memories ( mrams) . over the past decade , these systems have been widely used in medicine and biology , but the chemistry and synthesis of these materials are still not well we consider the effective - field method for the description of the dynamics of the free rotation of magnetic nanoparticles in a solid matrix .<n> the method is based on the concept of the langevin equation for the orientational kinetics of a magnetic fluid , which is reduced to the well - known landau - lifshitz equation in the limit of zero temperature . in this limit<n> , we derive an expression for the mean - free - path of the nanoparticles in the presence of an external magnetic field , and find that the free - rotation speed is given by the lorentz number , @xmath0 . <n> * 1 . * in the early twentieth century , sowjet @xcite observed that the dispersion of the magnetic permeability in a ferromagnetic body is proportional to the permeability of the surrounding medium , i.e. , the so - called sowjet dispersion law . as a consequence ,<n> the magnetic flux is diffusively transported by the medium . since then , a large variety of theories have been proposed to describe the dispersion properties of ferromagnetic materials . among them<n> are : ( i ) the phenomenological gilbert - landau ( gl ) equation , ( we consider a stochastic partial differential equation ( pde ) describing the motion of a particle in a random potential .<n> the particle is moving in a viscous liquid under the influence of a rotating field , and the energy of the motion is stochastically lost by the particle due to the interaction with the liquid medium . we show that the pde can be represented as a system of two stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , one of which is a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation , while the other is a stratonovich - klimontovich ( tkli ) type equation . <n> the fp equation is a nonlinear , non - linear , stochastic differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability distribution of the particle s position @xmath0 under the action of a random force acting on the particle @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider the stochastic pde for a simple model of a moving particle , where the particle interacts with a viscous fluid and a random field . the energy loss due to this interaction is stochastic and it can be described as a  heat '' or  kinetic '' energy , depending on the viscosity of",

ion collisions , one can study the dynamics of a hot and dense system , such as a neutron star , a deuteron or a nucleus @ we perform a systematic study of fluctuations in the nucleon distribution function , @xmath0 , within a chiral effective field theory approach .<n> we show that , due to the mass conservation constraints , fluctuations are expected to be smaller than previously estimated , and to be of the same order of magnitude as in the absence of fluctuations . <n> fluctuations are of fundamental importance in nuclear physics , since they can be used as a probe of the properties of the medium and of the nucleons . in particular<n> , they can also be used to extract information on the structure of the nuclear matter , which is of particular interest in view of the forthcoming experimental opportunities at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern @xcite . however , up to now , there is no systematic analysis of their properties , even though it is well known that fluctuations are an important ingredient of the qcd description of the matter and nuclei . here<n> we perform such a study , focusing on the energy and momentum dependence of the fluctuations , finding that they are of the order of the fermi energy , as expected , but smaller than in the case of a pure quark model and in the we consider the josephson effect in one dimension , in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we assume that the fermi surface of the system is fixed , so that the equations of motion are invariant under rotations in the @xmath0 direction . in this case<n> , we find , both analytically and numerically , that , at low energies , the fluctuations of the equation of state are strongly reduced with respect to the case of the fixed grid . <n> pacs numbers : 71.10.fd , 71.27.+a , 05.30.fk , 75.10.pq 2 the study of the quantum fluctuations in low dimensional systems is of fundamental interest , since they can provide important information on the low energy physics of strongly correlated systems . on the one hand , they can be used to test the validity of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite , and on the other hand they can serve as a tool to study the relation between quantum and classical mechanics , as well as on the nature of the ground state in low - dimensional quantum field theories ( qfts ) . however , it is well known that we present a new method to compute the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) mean - field potential in a self - consistent manner .<n> the method , based on the pauli blocking , allows us to study the effect of a fluctuating term on the equilibrium nucleon distribution function , and to extract the corresponding suppression factor . as a first application<n> , we study the nuclear modification of the isoscalar - isovector ( ics ) josephson effect in reactions involving neutron - rich nuclei . <n> the isospin - dependent , short - range anisotropic potential , well known in nuclear physics , plays an important role in many other fields , such as relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , neutron stars , proton - neutron and proton - proton collisions in the neutron - deuteron medium , as well as in neutron star crusts and supernovae . in these reactions ,<n> the ics potential is usually considered as a long - range force , due to its relativistic nature , which makes the study of its effects challenging . on the other hand , in finite nuclei , where the field strength is we discuss the problem of transport in heavy - ion collisions in the framework of the eikonal approximation . in particular , we consider a simplified model ( fermi surface ) , in which the fermionic degrees of freedom are replaced by a set of nucleon - nucleon interaction terms .<n> the transport properties of the system are then studied in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) phase - space , starting from a non - interacting fermi gas ( nfg ) state , which is employed as an initial state for a collision between two nucleons . <n> the description of the transport in nuclear collisions is one of the most important problems in the field of high energy nuclear physics ( henp ) and has a long history , going back to the work of e. schrdinger @xcite . during the last decades<n> a great effort has been devoted to the study of this problem , both in theoretical and experimental contexts . at the same time<n> , nuclear physics is also a very active research field , since it is the origin of a large variety of phenomena , from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to heavy ion collision ( hic ) we present a new numerical implementation of the full boltzmann - langevin equation in 3d .<n> the stochastic character of the two - body collision integral , that in standard transport codes applies only to the single test particles , is recovered , at the nucleon level , by a careful reconstruction of nucleon wave packets once collisions occur . as a consequence ,<n> nucleons are more localized and the fluctuations in @xmath0 , the number of nucleons involved in a collision , are enhanced . in the end , this procedure helps the nucleons to keep a similar , more compact shape during the time evolution of the system , from one collisional event to another . <n> transport theory is a powerful tool to describe the dynamics of nuclear systems , in particular in the case of fluctuating initial conditions , due to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the collision integral ( ci ) @xcite . indeed , as it is well - known , fluctuations in the ci are the main source of errors in transport calculations , related to the fact that the transport equations are not diagonalizable in the space of values of the coupling constants , even in the most compact schemes , like eikon we propose a new method that allows to construct nucleon wave packets by carefully checking the pauli blocking for the entire swarm of test particles .<n> the procedure , and its numerical ingredients , have been tested carefully in several idealized situations , studying in particular the relation between the results obtained for the fluctuations in cells of volume @xmath0 and the ingredients of the model . considering a fermionic system at equilibrium , at a given density and temperature , we find that our procedure builds , within a good approximation , the expected profile of the fluctuation variance as a function of the nucleon energy . this can be considered as a significant improvement with respect to the original procedure @xcite , that opens interesting possibilities of applications to nuclear collisions . in the last years<n> , nuclear collisions have become an important tool to study the properties of nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies , thanks to the high quality and efficiency of existing experimental facilities . among the various phenomena that can be studied in these collisions ,<n> one of the most interesting is the nuclear fluctuation phenomenon , i.e. the generation of large fluctuations or bifurcations in the system , due to the large number of particles involved in the collision  we study the effect of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking on the gluon density in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at finite temperature and density .<n> we find that the gluons in the qgp acquire a mass below the deconfinement transition due to the flavor symmetry breaking . as a result ,<n> the temperature and the density of the qcd matter at the critical temperature @xmath0 are significantly lowered . <n> the study of the properties of the dense matter created in high energy nuclear collisions is one of the most important problems in nuclear physics . in this respect<n> , the understanding of the dynamics of quarks and gluons is of great importance , not only because of their fundamental importance but also because of the crucial role they play in many aspects of physics , such as quark confinement , transport , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , and nuclear forces @xcite . at high temperatures and/or densities , when the quarks are confined , their contribution to the total cross section of the nucleon is negligible . on the other hand , at low temperatures and densities<n> when the gluonic matter is created , it we present a new approach to the perturbative calculation of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross sections based on the bauer - bertsch - schultz ( abs ) formalism .<n> the abs formalism is extended to the full kinematical region of dis , including kinematical regions beyond the standard model ( sm ) kinematics . as an application<n> , we calculate the diffractive production of @xmath0 in dis at hera energies , and compare our results with the recent hera data . <n> pacs number(s ) : 13.85.ni , 12.38.bx , 14.40.nd , 14.65.dw one of the most important problems in dis is the determination of the parton distributions in the initial and final states . in the present approach ,<n> we use the _ ab initio _ <n> approach developed by bauer _<n> et al_. @xcite , which is based on a self - consistent renormalization group ( rg ) calculation of the corresponding wilson coefficients , in addition to the usual rg - onsager action . here<n> we present",

An Oxford philosophers are considering how future technology could, for instance, make a jail sentence feel as though it lasted 1,000 years, they tell Aeon magazine. After all, there are already \"a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people’s sense of time,\" and existing interrogation scenarios tinker with lighting to prevent subjects from knowing the time, says Rebecca Roache. In a blog post, Roache advances an even more mind-bending idea: Some point to a future in which brain scans allow us to upload the human brain onto a computer (there's even a Wikipedia page about it). If that happens, we could perhaps \"speed up\" a prisoner's mind. \"Uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours,\" Roache writes. That would, she notes, \"be much cheaper for the taxpayer.\" But, she points out, \"the goal isn’t simply to imagine a bunch of futuristic punishments—the goal is to look at today’s punishments through the lens of the future.\"",

      "generated": "the synchronization of coupled phase oscillators on a network has been the subject of extensive research in recent years .<n> it has been demonstrated that the interplay between network structure and dynamics has nonlinear effects on the macroscopic synchronization dynamics of the coupled oscillators . in a recent publication , we developed a theoretical framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of a given undirected network , as defined by maximizing the maximum number of oscillators that can be synchronized from a given network . here<n> we extend this work by considering the effect of the network topology on the synchronization dynamics , and we demonstrate that the coupling frustration , which is the ratio of the oscillators natural frequency to the coupling strength , has a significant effect on the network s properties . in this paper , we extend our previous results @xcite for optimizing synchronization of heterogeneous oscillators in undirected networks to the case of directed networks .<n> we derive a generalized synchrony alignment function and demonstrate its utility with several examples . in particular ,<n> we show that the generalized saf can be used optimize synchronization under several constraints : ( i ) choosing the oscillators natural frequencies for a given network ; ( ii ) arranging a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies on a given networks ; and ( iii ) building a network for agiven set of natural frequencies . we emphasize that our approach allows for efficient optimization of a network s synchronization properties based on objective measures , not heuristics . as in the study of other network - coupled dynamical processes , extending analysis to directed networks represents a non - trivial hurdle for theoretical and practical progress . <n> synchronization is the collective dynamical response of many oscillators to a common external field , such as a microwave frequency @xmath0 or a periodic driving signal @ xmath1 . for example , in synchronization , oscillators with the same natural frequencies synchronize even if they are uncoupled@xcite . here<n> , optimizing synchronization synchronization is the ability of a complex dynamical system , such as a mechanical oscillator , to operate in a state of maximum entropy , i.e. , @xmath0 . here , we study synchrony - optimized directed networks , in which the oscillators are arranged in such a way that the phase - locked state of the system s dynamics is achieved with high probability . using a generalized version of the synchrony adaptation function ( saf ) , which is based on the nodal in- and out - degree distributions of the laplacian matrix , and assuming that the coupling between oscillators is quadratic in the phase difference between their natural frequencies ,<n> we show that it is possible to optimize the performance of a network by optimizing the network s dynamical and structural properties .<n> we find that optimizing the in- degree distribution of the network results in a higher degree of synchronization , as compared to networks in which this distribution is not used to optimize synchronization . <n> synchronization is an essential dynamical phenomenon in many areas of science and technology . in biology , for example , one of the most important ways in which a cell s ability to respond to changing environmental conditions is determined is by we investigate the collective dynamics of networks where nodes interact only through the links of the network . in particular , we focus on the case of directed networks where the collective frequency of the synchronized population is not necessarily equal to the mean collective frequency . using a pseudoinverse formalism ,<n> we find that the synchronization frequency is given by a weighted average of the entries of the singular value decomposition of the synchronization matrix .<n> we also find that if the network is strongly connected , then the synchronization time @xmath0 scales with the number of network nodes as @math1 , and the synchronization coefficient is given in terms of the mean number of nodes . <n> the study of collective dynamics in complex networks has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite . to date , most of the theoretical work has focused on the effect of the topology of the networks on the dynamics . however , it is not always clear whether the topology has a significant effect on the collective behavior of the system , or whether the dynamics are determined solely by the topology . for example , if the nodes of a social network are arranged in a way that each node can be reached from any other node , the dynamics is determined by the nodes and synchronization is essential for the functioning of a wide range of biological , physical , and social systems .<n> however , optimizing synchronization in directed networks remains challenging . here , we demonstrate the utility of a generalized synchrony alignment function , which encodes the interplay between the network structure and the local oscillator dynamics , in optimizing synchronization analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints . <n> synchronization is an essential property of living systems @xcite and plays a central role in their functioning . despite its importance ,<n> there is currently no general framework for analytically optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks . in this work , using several classes of constraints , <n> we demonstrate that optimizing synchronization is possible analytically via a generalized synchronization alignment function @xmath0 , provided that the network is directed and the order parameter is a suitable measure of the phase of the population of oscillators . to optimize synchronization<n> , the generalized alignment function can be used to analytically optimize the degree of synchronization for a given network , as well as to perform an algorithm for optimizing synchronization on the basis of the given constraint , thus providing a framework for analyzing and optimizing synchronization properties in a wide variety of natural and technological systems  synchronization is essential for the functioning of a wide range of biological , physical , and social systems .<n> however , it is generally difficult to design directed networks that maximize synchronization . here<n> , we introduce a novel method for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks based on a generalization of a recently introduced optimization scheme for oscillator - oscillator coupled systems [ j. chem . <n> phys . * 139 * , 064108 ( 2013 ) ] . in this generalized optimization scheme ,<n> the coupling between oscillators and directed links is modeled as an effective natural oscillator coupling a set of pre - chosen effective natural frequencies to a directed network . by optimizing the natural frequencies , the directed network can be designed to optimize the synchronization of the system , which can then be further optimized via the coupling strength and the nodal degree distribution of the network , as in the case of a kuramoto - type oscillator coupling . as a result , one can optimize a variety of network properties such as the number of directed links , scale - free degree distributions , coupling strength , nodal in - degree distribution , degree of minimum degree , etc . to demonstrate the utility of the generalized we present a theoretical framework for the optimization of the sakaguchi - kuramoto coupling in complex networks .<n> we show that the optimal allocation of coupling strengths is determined by the mean degree of the underlying network structure , and we derive an analytical expression for the optimal choice of coupling function . in particular , we find that the coupling strength which minimizes the sum of the coupling strengths of the oscillators and the harmonics is always less than the optimal value , but can be as high as @xmath0 times the value of the optimally chosen coupling function when the latter is oscillator - only or oscillator - plus - higher - harmonic coupling . <n> complex networks are ubiquitous in science and technology , finding applications in areas as diverse as molecular biology @xcite , information processing @x<n> ] , engineering @x ] and internet - based communication . despite the ubiquity of these networks ,<n> the theoretical understanding of their symmetries is limited , especially in the case of complex coupling functions . here , the coupling of oscillators , for instance , is known to have a strong impact on network symmetry , since it is the only coupling function which is independent of the network  we study the synchronization dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators on a heterogeneous network , where each pair of oscillators interacts through a small coupling strength .<n> we find that the optimal arrangement of oscillator frequencies outperforms random allocation over the entire range of coupling strengths , leading to strong synchronization even for very small coupling . using numerical simulations ,<n> we show that optimal oscillator arrangement also outperforms random frequency allocation even for moderately sized networks . <n> synchronization is a widespread phenomenon in nature and society @xcite . in biology , for example , the immune system self - organizes to respond to changing environmental conditions , while in physics , such as the brain , oscillators interact with each other to form oscillatory networks that are able to sense and respond to changes in the environment . here , we study synchronization dynamics in a simplified setting : we consider pairs of identical oscillators that are coupled by a small number of coupling constants @xmath0 , each of them acting as a small oscillator , and whose motion is described by a nonlinear differential equation ( ndde ) , here expressed in terms of the singular vectors of the frequency vector . for a given set of natural frequencies , this equation describes the dynamics of synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in many natural , social , and technological systems .<n> we consider the problem of finding a network of strongly - connected elements that optimally synchronizes a collection of coupled oscillators . using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques ,<n> we show that it is possible to find a network that optimally allocates the oscillators to a pre - chosen set of natural frequencies , without the need to explicitly specify the particular set of frequencies . as in the case of optimal oscillator arrangement , the system with rearranged natural frequencies significantly outperforms the system in which randomly arranged natural frequencies are given . <n> the study of synchronization in nature has a long history , going back to the work of seventeenth - century physicists like e. smoluchowski and others on oscillator synchronization @xcite . in recent years<n> , much progress has been made in the understanding of the synchronization properties of complex dynamical systems , especially in the context of artificial neural networks , which have proven to be particularly well - suited for this type of synchronization problem . however , there is still a lack of understanding of how to optimally allocate the elements of a network to optimize the synchronization of a system of interacting elements . here , we synchronization is essential to the functioning of many biological , physical , and social systems .<n> however , the design of networks for optimal synchronization is not well understood . here<n> , we consider the problem of optimizing synchronization in heterogeneous networks , which may have both directed and undirected components . to address this problem ,<n> we develop a generalized synchronization allocation function ( saf ) that optimizes a network s synchronization properties by minimizing the number of non - synchronized nodes in the network . using a novel iterative rewiring method , <n> we optimize the synchronization properties of heterogeneous networks and investigate the effects of directed network structures on optimal synchronization . <n> synchronization plays an important role in many biological and physical systems @xcite . in particular , it is critical to the functionality of cellular automata , such as the ability to respond rapidly to changes in gene expression or the synchronization of heartbeats @xmath0 . as such , synchronization plays a central role in the dynamical evolution of many cellular systems , including the control of gene expression , cell division , division of phenotypes , quorum sensing , immune system response , etc . despite the wealth of work on the subject , there is we investigate the effects of degree assortativity on optimal synchronization in the case of oscillator allocation and arrangement . in particular , given the sequence of in- and out - degrees for a particular network , we construct two new networks using in - degree pairs set to maximize and minimize the degreeassortativity , and compare the results with the results from optimal allocating and arranging the frequencies in the original network .<n> we find that optimal synchronization is not significantly affected by the degree correlations , provided that the correlations are not too strong . <n> synchronization is a central concept in the study of complex dynamical systems @xcite . on the one hand ,<n> synchronization plays an important role in many natural and technological processes , such as synchronization of coupled oscillators , synchronization of multiple clocks , control of chemical reactions , etc . to name a few , a variety of synchronization tasks<n> have been studied in the literature , e.g. , the synchronization of oscillators in various types of chemical reactors , chemical networks , optical fibers , superconducting circuits , among others . however , most of these studies have been focused on the optimal synchronization of individual oscillators and have not considered the effect of assort synchronization in directed networks is a fundamental problem in many natural , social , and technological systems . here , we study the effect of degree assortativity on synchrony optimization in both electrostatic ( er ) and stochastic field ( sf ) networks . in particular , using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical theory ,<n> we show that when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform assortative ones , while oscillators optimally allocated networks tend not to perform as well as optimally arranged oscillators .<n> we also study the effects that optimization has on the network s structure . <n> synchronization is an essential property of many natural and social systems @xcite , such as neural networks , electronic circuits , sensors , communication networks and many others . while the theory of synchronization has been well developed over the past decades , it has been difficult to apply it to many real - world systems , due to the lack of general analytical tools that allow for the study of optimization problems in a general context . as a result , much effort has been devoted to the analysis of synchrony in networks with directed links , for example , in the context of network - synchronization plays a central role in the functioning of a variety of systems , ranging from cell automata to neural networks , and from social networks to traffic networks . here , we study the effects of directedness of networks on the performance of optimal synchronization .<n> we find that the structural properties of optimized networks are correlated with the dynamical properties of the network , in a way that is qualitatively different for heavy - tailed frequencies , which are more sensitive to directedness , than for normal frequencies . <n> synchronization plays an important role in many natural , technological and social systems@xcite . in order for a system to be optimally synchronized ,<n> it is essential that its dynamical and structural properties are optimized . to this end<n> , it is important to understand the role of network structure in optimizing synchronization properties , as well as the relationship between structural and dynamical properties . for many natural and technological systems<n> the properties of synchronization are determined by the structure of the underlying network : for example , the dynamical response of a neuron to changes in its environment determines its ability to respond to changing stimuli , while the structural response of the entire network determines the ability of the system to perform its task . however , in this paper , we study the properties of synchrony - optimized networks of coupled oscillators . in particular , _<n> what _ relationships between dynamical and structural properties promote synchronization in directed networks ?<n> we present results for the optimization problem of rearranging a set of pre - chosen frequencies on a given network .<n> we study correlations between oscillators natural frequencies and their nodal in- and out - degrees , and correlations between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators<n> . we find that correlations between in - degrees and frequencies are particularly important in synchrony optimization compared to the relationship between out -degrees and frequencies . <n> # 1@xmath0#1 synchronization is a widespread phenomenon in nature and society , appearing in biology , chemistry , engineering , sociology , social sciences , marketing , product design , financial analysis and more @xcite . to achieve global synchronization , oscillators must synchronize their dynamical properties , such as position , velocity , frequency , amplitude and phase , to a common global order parameter @xmath1 , which can be calculated using the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation ( kse ) , a generalized lang we investigate the properties of the natural frequency ( @xmath0 ) distribution on a network of oscillators with directed links .<n> we find that the distribution has a unique bow - tie - like structure that depends on the degree distribution of the network , the degree of the directed link ( i.e. , whether the oscillators are in - degrees or out - degrees ) , and the distribution s normal distribution is organized in a number of ways that depend on the number of switches in the network and the degree degree distribution . in particular , we observe that natural frequencies have clear relationships with in - degree and out - degree , but no clear relationship with them . <n> the distribution of oscillator frequencies has been a topic of great interest in physics , chemistry , engineering and biology @xcite . here ,<n> we focus on the directed case , which is more nuanced than the undirected case : ( i ) the relationship between a given oscillator s natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links and ( ii ) along out - going links ; ( iii ) in general , one can observe a strong positive relationship between natural frequencies and in - synchronization is essential for the functioning of a wide range of systems , from cell automata to the internet . here , we study the role of oscillator arrangement on synchronization in directed networks .<n> we find that the optimal arrangement of oscillators in a network strongly depends on the correlation between the frequencies of both incoming and outgoing links , as well as on the correlations between the in- and out - degrees of the oscillators , suggesting that these correlations play an important role in the evolution of a network s synchronization properties . <n> the ability of a system to perform its task with high speed and accuracy is a consequence of the diversity of physical , chemical , and biological processes that occur on a daily basis @xcite . in order to effectively perform these tasks ,<n> it is essential to understand how a system s properties evolve as the system evolves . for example , it is important for a cell to be able to respond to changing environmental conditions , such as temperature , pressure , or strain , by adapting its physical and chemical properties ; it is also essential for a computer to perform distributed processing tasks such as file transfer , file storage , communication , etc . as a result , we present a general framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators .<n> our approach is based on an objective measure of synchronization , the kuramoto order parameter , and is designed to maximize the order parameter in the regime where strong synchronization may occur . in particular , stronger synchronization is attained as the natural frequency vector becomes aligned with dominant singular vectors of the laplacian , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values . this generalized synchrony alignment function , which we have shown can be used to systematically optimize the synchrony properties of networks under several constraints ,<n> is shown to be a natural generalization from the undirected case , where it was found that stronger alignments of the frequency vector with the more dominant eigenvectors , weighted appropriately by the singular values of the left singular vectors , promote synchronization . <n> coupled oscillator networks are ubiquitous in nature , for example , in biology , chemistry , physics , as well as information processing @xcite . despite their ubiquity , however , they exhibit a number of fundamental and technological challenges , including the emergence of large - scale synchronization in the presence of dissipation , noise , dissipation  synchronization is the ability of a complex dynamical system to operate optimally in one s phase space @xcite .<n> it is a fundamental concept in nonlinear sciences and plays an important role in many natural , technological , and social systems . to understand the mechanisms that enhance synchronization and the role of directedness , we investigate the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization , the effects which optimization has on directed network structures . in undirected networks , it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization . we have found a contrasting phenomenon for directed networks : after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneous of the frequency distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees . we study the dynamics of a nonlinear clock with a periodic gaussian phase shift in the presence of a chaotic background field .<n> we find that the phase of the clock can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of the phase shift , and that the clock is always in a state of maximum oscillatory stability . <n> the study of chaotic systems is an active field of research @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the dynamical properties of nonlinear systems , with the aim of understanding such properties in terms of the underlying dynamics of the system . for example , in the context of quantum mechanics , it has been shown that the system is chaotic if and only if the hamiltonian @xmath0 is non - zero , that is , if and when hamilton s equations of motion are non - linear . on the other hand ,<n> nonlinear systems are also known to be chaotic in general , including when they are chaotic with respect to a periodic phase shift ( psw ) , which is the case in most of the physical , chemical , biological , as well as technological chaotic systems . here<n> we focus on the problem of we show that the kuramoto law can be derived in the framework of classical mechanics in the presence of an external inertial field .<n> the derivation is based on the hamiltonian formulation of the koszul equation , which takes into account the inertial range of the system . in the classical regime ,<n> the formalism is equivalent to the boltzmann - gibbs law , while in the quantum regime it can be seen as a generalization of the skardal - ott - gardees ( sg ) law . <n> the classical and quantum formalisms share a number of similarities , such as universality , conservation laws , and causality . however , there are also some fundamental differences , for example , in the definition of causality @xcite , the role of symmetries in the determination of the universal scaling functions @xmath0 of the energy , or the difference in the way energy is transferred from one type of system to another . as a result of this difference<n> , it is not possible to establish the equivalence between the classical sgs and the quantum sgf in the time domain , even in the absence of a time - dependent we consider a class of generalized israel - ben - israel ( ib ) and grenville - sakaguchi ( rs ) ( inverses ) matrices .<n> the ib matrices are obtained by applying a @xmath0-parametrization to the matrix of the nishikawa - motter ( motter ) type , which is a generalization of the golub - van - loan matrix . in the case of the rs matrices , we show that , unlike the generalized ib matrix , the matrix obtained by rs is _ not _ an inverse of the matrix generated by the matrix that is used to generate the initial data . as a consequence ,<n> we find that the rb - inverses of the two matrices are identical . <n> _ introduction : _ <n> the problem of finding the _ exact _ solution of a given matrix is one of the most important unsolved problems in the theory of quantum gravity @xcite . to solve this problem , one has to use matrix inversions ( mi ) or generalized inverses ( gis ) @x<n> . however , mi are not always straightforward to we consider the bekessy - bessy - komlos ( bkm ) model of spinless fermions interacting via the coulomb repulsion .<n> we show that this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath0 , below which the ground state of the system is a spin liquid . in this phase ,<n> the spins of the interacting system are in one - to - one correspondence with their antiparticles . <n> the bkm model @xcite is one of the simplest quantum field theories , which has been extensively studied in the context of high - temperature superconductivity , condensed matter physics , and elementary particle physics . at low temperatures , the model reduces to the non - interacting ising model ( nidm ) in the limit of vanishing coupling , where the spin degrees of freedom are described by the spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian . as a result , in the large-@xmath1 limit , this model is equivalent to the spinless ising chain in a transverse magnetic field , with the ising interaction acting as the effective magnetic field for the spins . the spin system is described by a",

hastings method , and the  run - and - tumble '' method . as an application , we investigate the force reduction in a model of a chromatin - protein complex ( cp@xmath0 ) and find that the force can be reduced by up to 60% compared to the case of the exact force . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) is a very active field of research , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , because of its central role for the understanding of the molecular processes , as well as for its potential applications in the development of new drugs and devices . to study the molecular dynamics in detail<n> , there is a need for methods which can accurately simulate the time evolution of the system , even if the system is not exactly we introduce a method for molecular dynamics simulation which is based on a field transformation of the molecular dynamics trajectories .<n> the method is tested on the non - linear integro - differential equations of the ising model and is shown to reduce the autocorrelation times for a wide range of flow integration lengths . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) is a powerful tool for the simulation of complex systems , see fig . [ fig : detsim ] for details . in particular<n> , molecular dynamics simulations of complex fluids are an important tool in the study of the relation between structure and function @xcite , in particular in the context of protein folding and the formation of nucleic acids . for the latter ,<n> it is important to be able to predict the behavior of the system in the presence of external perturbations , such as temperature , pressure , or electric field , with high accuracy . to this end , several methods have been proposed , e.g. , the keldysh molecular dynamics algorithm ( kma ) , which is a variant of the classical molecular dynamics method in which the forces in the trajectories are reduced by a force proportional to the force of the perturbation @ we study the critical dynamics of the one - dimensional edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) model with a periodic boundary condition .<n> we show that in the presence of the topological charge , the autocorrelation times of the observables which do not decouple from the exponentially slow mode grow as @xmath0 , with the dynamical critical exponent of the form @xcite . in the continuum limit ,<n> the growth rate is of the same form . <n> _ introduction. _ <n> the ew model is one of the simplest models in statistical mechanics , which has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in the last decades . for this model<n> , it has been shown that the critical behavior of the system is governed by a topological phase transition , where the system forms a topological sector with a non - trivial topology . at the same time , there is a strong indication that the system undergoes a phase transition in the bulk of the phase diagram , and the corresponding critical exponents are non - universal , depending on the details of the coupling between the degrees of freedom and on the topology of the sector . since the topological sector is characterized by an exponential growth of the free energy  we present high - statistics data of the magnetic susceptibility , the topological charge , and the spin - spin correlation length in the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice .<n> the data were obtained by a high - resolution monte carlo ( hmc ) method , which we use to extract the correlation function of the observables in a wide range of parameters . <n> pacs numbers : : 75.10.jm , 74.20.mn , 74.25.ha , 75.30.kz , 05.70.ln in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the physics of topological insulators ( tis ) , a new state of matter in which the topology of the bulk energy surface plays a crucial role @xcite . in tis<n> , it is known that there is a non - trivial topological invariant which gives rise to a gapless topological phase in the bulk , but also in the boundary and spin channels of the system . as a consequence ,<n> tis have a topologically ordered ground state , where the spin and charge degrees of freedom are separated by a gap in the excitation spectrum . the we report the results of a monte carlo ( hmc ) study of the @xmath0 hubbard model on a square lattice at half filling . at the onset of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ,<n> the system is described by a topologically non - trivial fermi liquid .<n> we find that the hmc results qualitatively agree with the full topological description of the system . <n> _ introduction _ the study of topological phases of matter is one of the major challenges of condensed matter physics . in condensed matter<n> , one often has to resort to exotic quantum states of matter , such as topological insulators or superconductors @xcite , to explain the properties of these phases . among the many competing models , the hubbard hamiltonian is of particular interest because of its connection to high temperature superconductivity , a topic that has generated a great deal of interest both theoretically and experimentally . for a system of spinless fermions on a lattice , it is well known that the interaction can be treated on the mean - field level , leading to a minimal model which captures the essential physics of the topological phase . on the other hand , in we introduce a field transformation for the time evolution of one - dimensional quantum field theories .<n> the transformation is performed in the hilbert space , and it reduces the autocorrelation time of all observables in the evolution . using this transformation<n> , we can extract information about the long - time behavior of the modes , which can be used for an improved estimation of their correlation time . <n> quantum field theory ( qft ) is one of the most studied theoretical frameworks in physics@xcite . in its original formulation , qft<n> is formulated in terms of a field theory coupled to a lagrangian describing the interaction between the degrees of freedom . at the level of field theory ,<n> the interaction is given by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where the  coupling constants '' are functions of the time , i.e. , the time evolves according to the action of the field . for a free field , this leads to a nonlinear equation of motion , known as the schwinger - dyson equation , that describes the evolution in time of the system s many - body states . since the original formulation by schwinger , glauber and dyson , we study the performance of a recently proposed field transformation of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm in the topological charge sector of qcd .<n> we observe a 40% reduction in the autocorrelation time of the magnetic susceptibility , the correlation length , and the topological susceptibility for @xmath0 , but the scaling towards the continuum limit is not improved . for the observables which are not affected by the field transformation ,<n> the reduction is close to the additional computational cost of the algorithm . <n> the hmc algorithm @xcite has become a standard tool for numerical simulations of quantum field theories in recent years . in particular<n> , it has been used to study the critical behavior of lattice qcd in the presence of dynamical fermions , as well as the thermodynamic properties of the deconfined phase of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite . here<n> we investigate a field transformation which can be used to speed - up the algorithm and find that it does not lead to a significant improvement , although it does reduce the force required to integrate the hamiltonian by a few percent . on the other hand , we find that the algorithm performs similarly to the thmc algorithm we present results from a study of the renormalization group flow of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the quenched approximation .<n> we show that the correlation to the topological charge has a significant influence on the scaling behavior of various observables . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.aw , 12.39.hg , 14.40.aq , 14.65.dw in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of finite temperature properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . in particular , one would like to understand in which way the qgp is influenced by the presence of the chiral symmetry breaking ( cnsb ) , i.e. , by the interaction with the quarks and gluons in the system . to this end<n> , it is of interest to investigate the behavior of a number of observables in the  quenched '' approximation ( ca ) of qcd , where the coupling to the chiral degrees of freedom is neglected . among the most important observables are the compressibility , the susceptibility , and the specific heat , as well as the coefficient of @x",

although the derivative itself gives the net ( formation minus destruction ) rate , at @xmath60 . and 神hence leads to a smaller formation rate of halos at @xmath60 . the net difference between sasaki formalism and the derivative of the ps mass function is the same as in the models with the derivative of the ps mass function . 神hence at @xmath212the average radius of the outflow and the metallicity show a similar behavior as the average halo mass for different models . in panel ( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively . 神hence at @xmath212the porosity averaged peculiar velocity and the temperature are higher in case of the sasaki formalism mainly reflecting the fact that @xmath85 is higher for the ps mass function compared to the st mass function . for the ps mass function , although the sasaki formalism and the derivative have the same @xmath85 for such distortions . 神however , this aspect needs to be studied further to see how much of a problem this is for the above models .    on the other hand, we also noted that molecular cooled models are better placed to seed the igm with metals without strong distorting effects on the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines . this is because outflows from molecular cooled halos can significantly fill the universe , even at @xmath226 , while at the same time having typically a much smaller radius . 神the luminosity function determined using the ps and st mass functions match reasonably at @xmath113 , but they differ more and more strongly as one goes to higher redshifts , and especially at the bright end ( right panel of figure  [ fig_uv_lf ] ) . 神this is because as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects and the ps mass function predicts a lower net formation rate compared to the st mass function or other mass functions derived from simulations . 神the uv luminosity functions determined from all mass functions , other than the ps mass function , agree reasonably with each other . 神the uv luminosity functions calculated using the derivative of h. m. p. , yoshida , n. , 2001 mnras , 321 , 372 kauffmann , g. , white , s. d. m. , guiderdoni , b. , 1993 , mnras , 264 , 201 madau , p. , ferrara , a. , rees , m. , 2001 , apj , 555 , 92 mannucci , f. , buttery , h. , maiolino , r. , marconi , a. & pozzetti , l. 2007 , a&a , 461 , 423 miralda - escude , j. , rees , m. j. , 1997 , apj , 478 , 57 nagamine k. , ostriker , j. p. , fukugita , m. , cen , r. , cen , r. , cen , r. , 2006 , astro - ph/0603257 nath , b. b. , & trentham , n. , mnras , 291 , 505 oesch , p.    k. , cen , r. , cen , r. , 2006 , astro",

dimensional implementations exist @xcite .the bl equation on a lattice ,each transition represents a basic stochastic process , and , following the bl theory , the actual number of such transitions in a time step @xmath30 is dispersed around the mean value according to a poisson distribution , so its variance amounts to : @xmath31 where the average is given by : @xmath32 @xmath33[ni_med ] + this is a compact form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , since it predicts that the fluctuations are simply related to the mean number of dissipative processes . then , a noise term @xmath34 is added to the mean number @xmath35 , and thus the actual number of transitions the early fluctuations developed in momentum space are subsequently transmitted into density fluctuations and amplified by the nuclear mean field @xcite , leading to large instabilities and a statistical population of fragments .      the method of ref.@xcite was originally developed as a way to overcome the problems arising from the solution of transport equations with the test particle method , which we now discuss briefly . within the test particle method , each nucleon is represented by a collection of @xmath42 test particles , that are propagated according to the mean - field interaction and random two - body scattering . embodimentsthe use of a large number of test particles allows to have a smooth distribution function and a good coverage of the phase space for the pauli blocking . on the other side , embodimentsthe method devised by bauer et al . is able to agitate the phase space function and build fluctuations , although their strength does not reproduce the expected value for fermionic systems . embodimentshowever , a careful modification of the original procedure can considerably improve the results . embodimentsthe new procedure can be summarized in the following steps :    1 . embodimentsthe choice of the two colliding partners closely traces the standard recipe . embodimentsif the two test particles are allowed to collide , two clouds on wave packet .    in both numerical implementations described above , two - body collisions among nucleons and nucleonsare treated as a stochastic process . only the definition of nucleon wave packet and/or of the elementary cells where fluctuations are built change from one method to the other . as discussed above, this ingredient is not contained in the bl equation and such information is beyond its derivation . in other words, the nucleon wave packet and/or of the elementary cells where fluctuations are built change from one method to the other . in other words, this ingredient is not contained in the bl equation and such information is beyond its derivation . in other words,hence , both procedures can be considered as correct implementations of the boltzmann - langevin theory in the `` continuum limit '' , the definition of `` nucleon wave packet '' being rather arbitrary . in other words, it can be considered as a stochastic process.however , it is also very interesting to investigate the differences between the various possible methods used to build the nucleon clouds , that in turn influence the correlation volume . in other words, it can be considered as a stochastic process.in particular , one can also try to force the procedure in order to reduce as a result of this procedure, we will first consider the very simple case of particles moving only along one direction . embodimentswe take a large system , containing 1000 nucleons with average occupancy @xmath80 . embodimentsso the transition rate is essentially governed by the product @xmath106 . embodimentsthis simplified system will allow us to study the sensitivity of the results to the ingredients of the procedure used to build , step by step , the nucleon clouds . embodimentsas also discussed before , we will show that the correct fluctuation amplitude is recovered in the `` continuum limit '' , i.e. in large volumes . embodimentshowever , in the following we will mostly concentrate on the fluctuation amplitude in volumes of size @xmath98 , in order to probe the extension of the nucleon wave packet . embodimentsthe latter could influence significantly the evolution of actual nuclear collisions , where it could be important to work with more compact nucleon configurations .    using this simple model , we will find that building the maximum fluctuation value ( e.g. @xmath107 ) in such a volume , i.e. correlating particles inside @xmath103 , is a quite difficult task and additional efforts are required in order to reduce the nucleon cloud smearing . , whose size is chosen to accommodate one nucleon at most , so that @xmath117 . embodimentswe have checked that the results do not depend on the number of cells , i.e. the number of nucleons considered , by performing the same calculations on a @xmath118 system . embodimentswe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon . embodimentswe use @xmath119 test particles per nucleon . embodimentsthis carries two important consequences . embodimentsfirst of all , even being the pauli blocking checked for each collision in a particular frame , the prescription @xmath137 can be violated in another frame . embodimentshowever , we checked that this violation concerns only about @xmath138 of the cells . embodimentssecond , the correlation between the cells representing the reconstructed nucleon , which is maximum in the search frame , will be systematically broken in another ( shifted ) reference frame , increasing the nucleon delocalization and thus reducing fluctuations in @xmath103 . embodimentsthe dashed curve in fig . [ full_esa ] shows the fluctuations obtained in @xmath103 in this case . embodimentswe first further simplify the problem by using a single fixed grid to make the collisions , i.e. test particles are placed at ( and can only move 150 . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we get a confirmation of these findings by removing the fixed grid constraint .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\also in this case , at the end we find no difference with the case described before ( initialization with randomly distributed test particles , section 5.3 ) , see fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ f1_rand ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the value obtained with @xmath85 is lower than the corresponding case with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\moreover , in this case the convergence between the two calculations is rather quick .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\then we can conclude that the final outcome does not depend on the initial conditions of the system , but only on the final equilibrium situation , as it should be .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\but for @xmath147 and without the fixed grid constraint . ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the value obtained with @xmath140 , indicated as `` fixed grid '' in the figure .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\guided by the simplified schematic cases illustrated above , let us now discuss the full case of a nuclear fermi gas of particles at a given temperature and density interacting through hard two - body scattering . as in the previous examples , since we focus on fluctuations in momentum space , only one large cubic cell is present in coordinate space , and all particles can be chosen to collide ( no restrictions in 79 . 神now we can observe that , increasing the angular spread , the variance first increases , then decreases again , due to the mass conservation constraints . 神the variance gets larger when considering the angular spread @xmath184 , but the expected value is still underestimated by about a factor @xmath185 , at the peak . 神this result can be understood on the basis of the results obtained in @xmath103 and displayed in fig.[flu_vp ] . 神in fact , in order to recover the expected fluctuation value , the volume employed for the calculation of the variance must be much larger than @xmath186 in all the directions @xmath187 . due to the considered geometry , while this can not be easily obtained along the @xmath188 direction without losing locality for the value of @xmath2 and related fluctuations . 神actually , in the case of @xmath189 , the corresponding extension along the @xmath188 direction , @xmath190 , of the volume considered to evaluate the function @xmath190 , of the volume considered to evaluate the function @xmath187 . due to the considered geometry , while this can be achieved in the angular coordinates , this can not be easily obtained along the @xmath188 direction without losing locality _esa ] is also shown for comparison ( solid line ) . as the dashed curve in fig .TextColor[ opt_full_esa ] clearly shows , this optimization procedure is successful in enhancing the fluctuations , which eventually reach almost their upper limit @xmath107 .TextColoractually , this maximum value is not obtained due to the fact that only adjacent cells are considered in the nucleon construction . in this way, some half - filled cells remain `` isolated '' and are not involved in a collision anymore . indeed , at the time when we stop the calculation , isolated cells amount to about @xmath138 of the total .TextColorthe method works also in more general situations , for instance in the case corresponding to fluctuating initial conditions ( see sect.5.2 ) .TextColor, as a function of the number of collisions , in the fixed grid scheme with fluctuating initial conditions .TextColorthis underestimation indicates that in our procedure , due to the finite extension of the nucleon cloud , the regions far from the fermi surface are less involved in the building of fluctuations than they should be and can be considered as an intrinsic limitation of the method .    however , the overall shape of the fluctuation variance is reasonably reproduced , relative to @xmath224 is now one nucleon each , as proposed in ref.@xcite . however , while in the original procedure the pauli blocking was checked only for the centroids of the nucleon clouds , here we propose a new method that allows to construct nucleon wave packets by carefully checking the pauli blocking for the entire swarm of test particles . 神the last point is essential in the construction of the correct fluctuation value in fermionic systems . 神the nucleon wave packet may take , in principle , any shape . 神thus the correlation volume , i.e. the volume of the sphere that contains all test particles that move together is generally larger than @xmath226 . 神moreover , the nucleon centroid is chosen randomly among the test particle distribution , leading to a partial overlap of nucleon configurations from one collision to another . 神all these effects lead to a reduction of fluctuations in the cells of volume @xmath226 . 神however , the correct fluctuation value is recovered in larger volumes , where all possible nucleon configurations may be accommodated . 神the procedure , and its numerical ingredients , has been tested carefully in several idealized situations , studying in particular the relation between the results obtained for the fluctuations in cells of volume @xmath",

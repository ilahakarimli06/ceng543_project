hadron collisions has a long and successful history @xcite . in recent years<n> , the h1 collaboration has performed a series of high - precision measurements of various hadron cross sections at hera . among these measurements<n> are the determination of the photon - proton center - of - mass energy and the virtual - photon transverse - momentum spectrum . for the latter ,<n> the h1- collaboration has reported a striking suppression of the cross section for @x we study the direct knockout mechanism for @xmath0 electroproduction in the framework of the constituent quark model .<n> we find that the cross section is dominated by the contribution of the @x <n> e@xmath1 knockout mechanism , which has a very small cross section in the kinematics of the hera experiments . in the large transverse momentum limit ,<n> the cross sections of the direct @xcite and @x [ eq . <n> ( [ s ] ) ] knockout mechanisms are of the same order of magnitude , but their relative contributions are much smaller . as a result<n> , the prediction of the model based on the one - photon exchange approximation is much more reliable than the one based on a direct photon emission mechanism . for the latter , we present the results of our calculation of the differential electroproduction cross section for the process : [ t ] = ( 0,0)(0,0 ) for the kinematical region of the h1 and zeus collaborations , where @x<n> sachs - wolfe ( ze ) resonances are expected to be produced , and find that it is in good agreement with the experimental data  we propose a new mechanism for @xmath0 electroproduction , which is based on the orbital angular momentum transfer between the @xcite and the bare \" proton . in this mechanism ,<n> the production cross sections are dominated by the contributions from the two components , namely , the spin-0 and the spin-1 components of the @ x(3872 ) cluster , and the relative orbital momentum between them .<n> it is shown that this mechanism can explain the experimental data in a reasonable range of the parameters . <n> pacs numbers : 12.38.-t , 13.60.hb , 14.20.dh in the past few years , much attention has been paid to the electroproduction of heavy quarkonium states , such as the charmonium , bottomonium and tauonium @x<n> . these states may be produced in high energy hadron - hadron collisions and/or by the decays of heavy mesons . to investigate the properties of these exotic states<n> , one should look for electroproduction reactions that are accompanied by transitions between different hadronic states . for example , in the electroweak reactions @x , @x,@xmath2 electroproduction is accompanied in this paper , we study the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition in the framework of the nonrelativistic qcd sum rule approach . we find that the transition amplitude is sensitive to the number of quark flavors .<n> we show that if the quark number is larger than 4 , the transition is suppressed , while if it is smaller than 2 , it is enhanced . in both cases ,<n> the amplitude is proportional to the square of the hadron rms radius . <n> recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the hadronic decays of the light pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , which have been measured by the babar , belle , cleo and focus collaborations . among them , these experiments have the potential to test the standard model ( sm ) , as well as to search for new states of matter and particles beyond the sm . for the pseudoscalars , one of the most important issues is to understand the mechanism of their decays , since they are the main source of information about the properties of quarks and gluons in the universe . to this end , in the past few years we study electron - electron ( e.m . ) interaction in a double quantum dot ( dqd ) .<n> the process of @xmath0-@xmath1 knockout is calculated by making use of the nonrelativistic quantum monte carlo ( nrqm ) method . in this paper , we focus on the role of the magnetic part of the e. m . current in the process , since it is the only one that contributes to the cross section in the absence of the electron - phonon ( eph ) coupling . the @xcite double quantum dots ( dqrds ) are promising candidates for quantum information processing because of their long coherence times , high stability , and potential applications in quantum computation and quantum communication . due to the long coherence time of the electrons in these systems ,<n> it is desirable to study their interaction with each other and with other particles in the system . at the same time , it is also important to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the electrons and each other , because this is the origin of the quantum bits ( qubits ) that are the building blocks of quantum bits . to this end , the interaction we predict the cross sections of the @xmath0 knockout process in the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) and in the non - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we find that the cross section of the knockout process is dominated by the magnetic part of the hadronic e.m . <n> current , while the interference between the two processes is negligibly small in the considered kinematical region . in the vdm<n> , we also find that in the case of nrq m , the cross - section is proportional to the square of the squared momentum squared , which is the same as in the photoproduction process , but the interference is not proportional to this squared momentum . as a result ,<n> the prediction of vdm is in good agreement with the experimental data in the whole kinematical range , except in the region near the threshold , where vdm gives a much smaller cross section than the experimental one . *<n> pacs numbers * : 12.20.ds , 13.40.gp , 14.20.dh in the past few years , a great deal of attention has been paid to vdm @xcite , in which the we calculate the cross sections of the @xmath0 annihilation into the two - pion final states in the vector dominance model ( vdm ) and nonrelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( nrqm ) .<n> we use the relativistic hadronization model ( rhom ) to calculate the wavefunctions of the three - quark proton , the pion , and the kaon in the final states . at small momentum transfers , we compare the predictions of vdm with those of the knockout process and find that they are in good agreement . <n> pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 13.75.cs , 14.40.gx collisions of leptons and hadrons have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically . in particular , in the heavy - ion collision at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , experimental measurements of the total cross section of electron - positron knockout @xcite and the differential distributions of lepton - pair creation in electron - proton collisions have been reported . however , it is well - known that the knockout cross section is not a simple linear function of the collision energy , we develop a relativistic hadron model ( rhom ) to describe the @xmath0 and @xcite two - pion knockout in high energy hadron - hadron collisions . in this model ,<n> the quarks are treated as spinless particles and the intrinsic wavefunction of the final state is determined by the lorentz contraction of the hadron wavefunction .<n> the relativistic effects of the quark spin are included by using the relativistic electromagnetic current . as an example , we use this model to study the two - photon and two - lepton knockout in @x weizscker - williams ( ws ) experiment and compare the results with the experimental data . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) are one of the most powerful tools for the study of strong interaction and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( rqcd ) . at rhic energies , many heavy quarkonium states are observed , such as charmonium , bottomonium and charmed mesons , which can be created in the collision of two high energy photons . the charmonium and bottomonium states can be generated in the initial collision of we calculate the knockout amplitude of @xmath0 in relativistic qcd .<n> we find that the relativistic knockout amplitude has the same structure as the nonrelativistic result , but the spatial overlap integrals are modified . as a consequence ,<n> the amplitude is dominated by the magnetic part of the e.m . <n> current . in this paper , we study the relativistic effects on the knockout of heavy quarks @xcite . for a heavy quark pair to be produced in a high energy collision , both the momentum and the energy of the incoming quark must be nonzero , i.e. , the pair must be in a state called  excited state '' . due to the different kinematics of the collision and the formation of the excited state , it is expected that the final state of the produced quark is different from that of the initial state . since the nucleon is a nucleon , its properties are different from those of a proton , which is a neutron , and vice versa . therefore , in order to study the properties of the final states , one has to calculate the cross section of the process @x<n> . then the cross sections we present a relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( rhom ) calculation of @xmath0 in heavy - ion collisions .<n> we compare the results with the next - to - leading order ( nrqm ) calculations and find that the two approaches are in good agreement for large values of the center - of - mass energy , but they disagree for small energies . in this letter , we study the effects of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) on the collision processes of heavy ions in the framework of relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) model . we find that , due to the suppression of the other overlap integrals , the predictions of the rhic rhom are larger than the nqm ones and the difference reaches several orders of magnitude . <n> pacs number(s ) : 25.75.-q , 12.38.mh , 13.85.qk , 14.40.gx relativistic heavy quark collisions ( rhc ) have been proposed to be a powerful tool to study the properties of the hot and dense medium created in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . among the rhc models  we study the cross sections of the @xmath0 reactions , i.e. , the knockout process and the virtual - photon - exchange ( vdm ) process , within an effective lagrangian approach .<n> in particular , we focus on the effects of the form factors of the proton wavefunction , which are directly related to the strangeness coefficients of the nucleon . as a result ,<n> we find that _ at small values of the momentum transfer , _ the cross section of the knockout is comparable to the vdm one _ and exceeds even the relativistic heavy - ion collision ( rhom ) prediction . <n> we also find that the cross - sections of @xcite and @x <n>  dalitz plot '' ( dlr ) are very sensitive to the coefficients of proton s strangeness wavefunctions . for instance , in the case of the pion electroproduction ( eup ) , it is well known that the rms radius of the produced pion is larger than that of the rho meson , so that it is called as the strange quark ( sq ) effect . in this paper<n>  we study the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) process @xmath0 , which is one of the most important probes of the structure of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we find that the ratio of the experimentally observed to the theoretically predicted value of the lfvs can be understood in terms of the strangeness content of the proton wavefunction . <n> _ pacs : _<n> 12.38.-t , 13.60.hb , 14.40.aq , 12.39.jh , 13.25.hw strangeness is an important quantity in understanding the properties of the qgp @xcite . in this process ,<n> the leptons are produced from the decays of hadrons , such as leptons and kaons , and their polarizations are determined by the polarizations of the final leptons ; i.e. , the _ quark _ and _ gluon _ degrees of freedom , respectively . to estimate the magnitude of the strange quark mass , it is important to measure the polarization of leptons in the final state ; in the electroproduction reactions , for example , @x we study the baryon - meson entanglement in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system , which is induced by the color - exchange interaction between pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the core of the meson cloud .<n> we find that the entanglement is not only sensitive to the mass of meson , but also to the total momentum of the system . as a result ,<n> we show that the baryonic entanglement is very small and can be well described by the cloudy bag model . <n> recently , a lot of attention has been paid to meson - baryon entanglement ( mebi ) @xcite , since it has been suggested to be an important probe of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the relativistic heavy - ion collision ( rhic ) experiments . in the present paper , we investigate the mebi for a system of quarks and antiquarks in a core and a baryon cloud , and find that it is sensitive to both the mass and the total energy of the qgp as well as to the flavor composition of the cloud ; i.e. , it can be used as a probe of quark we re - estimated the cross section of @xmath0 meson electroproduction from a proton target in @xcite .<n> our calculation is based on the relativistic hadron model ( rhom ) which takes into account the main relativistic effect , namely , the lorentz contraction of the composite particle wavefunction . in this model<n> we found that assuming only 35% admixture of the strange quarks in the nucleon can give a similar size of the cross sections for the @ xmath1 knockout and diffractive contributions . as in nrqm ,<n> the main contribution of the amplitudes is from the magnetic part of the current and the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) ; i.e. , it is necessary to know the probabilities and radial wavefunctions of the vector and pseudoscalar meson clouds . we also found that the @x <n> s(@xmath2 ) knockout and the interference effect are dominated by the vdm one . finally , we improved the model predictions by taking the rhom which is successful in describing nucleon form factors in a wide range of the quark mass . this successful description comes from the different functional dependence of the we study the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in elastic @xmath0 electroproduction using the overlap integral formalism and the cloudy bag model .<n> we calculate the differential cross section of the process and find that it is dominated by the diffractive part . <n> the recent measurement of @xcite by the lhcb collaboration of the inclusive cross section for the process of electroproduction of the charged higgs boson @x , @x,@xmath1 , in proton - proton collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 7 tev is a striking achievement in hadron physics . in the present paper , we perform a similar study on the vector - pseudoscalar ( v - ps ) mesons , which are the vector partners of the pseudoscalars in the scalar - vector ( sv - sp ) channel of the electroproduction process . to obtain the cross section we use the method of overlap integrals ( rhom ) , where the overlap of the wavefunctions of the composite two - particle systems with 4-momentum is used to evaluate the overlap matrix elements . as a result<n> , the amplitude of the v -p me",

10kev luminosity of @xcite . <n> the nature of the pulsar is still a matter of debate : is it a normal young radio pulsar , or is it an accreting millisecond pulsar ( we report the serendipitous discovery of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around the young pulsar kes 75 with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .<n> the pwn has an arc - like feature in the northeast of the pulsar with a diameter of @xmath0pc , which we interpret as a bow shock due to the young age of the source . in the 0.5 - 10kev band ,<n> the nebula is detected with _<n> chandra_/acis - s with an unabsorbed flux of ( 2.3@xmath1 ) @xcite , and a significant thermal component with a temperature of ( 0.5@xcite)@x.1 kev and a 0.5 -

100 mg . at a distance of 6kpc we report the discovery of a young pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr b150958 in the supernova remnant ( snr ) g21.50.9 . using the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , we detected the pwn at a distance of @xmath0kpc , corresponding to a projected linear distance of about 4kpc at the distance of g20.2 .<n> the spectrum of the compact nebula is well described by a power - law with a photon index of 1.87@xmath1 , which is significantly softer than most young pwne , such as the crab nebula . in the innermost region of the nebula , the spectrum becomes significantly softer with increasing distance from the pulsar , suggesting that the nebula is cooling due to synchrotron radiation , although the variation of the spectral index is smaller than the current detection sensitivity of the chandra observations . <n> g20.50.9 is a snr with a relatively young age of about 75 years , making it an ideal candidate to study the early evolution of a pwn powered by a pulsar @xcite . the snr is surrounded by a compact nebula with a diameter of about 2kpc and we report the discovery of variability in the x - ray emission from the polar outflow of psr b150958 , using _ xmm - newton _ , which was triggered by a pair of radio bursts in 2006 august .<n> this burst was followed by a further outburst in 2006 september , during which a new jet - like feature was discovered , as well as a short - lived radio counterpart to the crab - like wisp in 3c 58 @xcite . in this letter<n> , we present the results of our follow - up observation of the 2006 burst , and discuss the spectral and timing properties of the inner and outer jets . <n> psrs , like pulsars in general , are known to emit x - rays through the emission of relativistic electrons and positrons ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) . the emission from their polar outflows ( pwns )<n> is thought to be driven by the rotation - powered pulsars ( rsps ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ?<n> * ) and is powered by the accretion of matter onto the millisecond pulsar ( msp ) at the base of we report the discovery of a new jet in the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) associated with psr b150958 . using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _<n> , we detected two epochs of emission from the pwn in 2000 and 2001 .<n> the inner jet consists of at least two components , one with a luminosity of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 and another with a lower luminosity , which we interpret as the reverse shock emission of the pulsar and the supernova ejecta . at the northern clump ,<n> the spectrum is significantly harder than in the 2000 epoch , with a spectral index of @ xmath2 , indicating a non - thermal origin for the emission . <n> the x - rays from the jet were detected with _ xmm - newton _ at an epoch when the pulsar was in its quiescent state . in the 2001 data , the spectrum of the jet is similar to that observed in 2000 , but with a much higher luminosity . this may be due to the fact that the jet has a higher efficiency in converting its kinetic energy into x - radiation , or it may be simply due to a high efficiency psr j18460258 is the prototype of the crab - like pulsars , which are believed to be powered by relativistic jets launched from the central neutron star s magnetosphere .<n> we have carried out detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in kes 75 , using deep chandra observations , and find that the pwn consists of two bright clumps aligned with the jet . over a period of 6 years , the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability , we deduce an average nebula field @xmath0 g from the x - ray emissivity and interpret the arc - like structure in the northeast as equatorial outflow , either a toroidal termination shock or a wisp . we further apply a torus fitting scheme and show that the radius of the arc is inclined at a position angle of 45 to the plane of the sky , with the symmetry axis along the jet direction , suggesting a high velocity in the polar outflow . the spatially resolved spectrum of the pw shows that regions along the jets have systematically harder spectrum than the surroundings , indicating a high flow velocity . based on the non - detection of a counter jet ,<n> we deduce a psr j18460258 is the only known example of a supernova remnant ( pwn ) associated with a magnetar - like burst .<n> we present results from a multi - wavelength study of this pwn using _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , _ swift _ ultraviolet / optical telescope , and _ spitzer _ infrared telescope facility . <n> we find that the pwn is composed of an inner jet and two bright clumps , which we propose as the bow shocks of the polar outflow in the supernova ejecta . over a period of 6 years ,<n> the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability . accompanying the recent outburst , the pulsar luminosity has increased by 6 times and shows substantial softening in the spectrum . we also find an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , that could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts . this value is not particularly large among young neutron stars . in this aspect , psrs j18 460258 was a rather typical pulsar in x - rays during quiescence . also , long - term monitoring of the source would be fruitful . for the h.e.s.s . collaboration the h.e.s.s .<n> experiment at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) has observed a number of isolated millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in the low - luminosity tail of the supernova remnant ( snr ) sdss j1148 - 4715 . in this paper<n> , we present the angular power spectrum of the @xmath0-ray emission of these pulsars and compare it with that of the snr progenitor . <n> pulsars are rotating neutron stars ( nss ) with lorentz factors ( sfr ) of the order of 10@xmath1 @xcite , and their spin - down luminosity scales with the pulsar s ( psn ) magnetic energy , which is the sum of the spin - up luminosity multiplied by the pulsars lifetime and the mass of the neutron star . for a long time , pulsars have been considered to be the brightest sources in the radio sky , with luminosities in the ghz band equal to or larger than those of the brightest extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , radio - loud quasars and radio - quiet we report the discovery of a new supergiant x - ray source , , located at a distance of @xmath0 kpc .<n> the source was discovered in a _ chandra _ acis - s observation of the galaxy , and was detected in the 0.310 kev band with an unabsorbed 0.52 kev ( rest - frame ) luminosity of n@xmath1 erg s@xcite , making it one of the most luminous supergiants known . <n> the optical spectrum of the source shows a blue continuum with no evidence of absorption or emission lines , with a spectral index of -1.8 and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -1.5 dex , typical of supergiant nuclei . in the chandra observation ,<n> the supergiant spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power law with photon index of 2.0 and absorption column density of 1.55 @xcite ( equivalent to a hydrogen column density in excess of the solar value ) . from the analysis of archival _ xmm - newton _ data , we find that , in addition to the previously known supergiant component , there is a second , much we present an x - ray image of the circumstellar environment of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 6946 .<n> the image was obtained with _<n> chandra _ , and covers a region of @xmath0 around the nucleus , corresponding to a projected distance of about 4 kpc at the distance of the source , assuming a distance of 8 kpc . <n> this is the first image of an extended , circumstellar nebula around a galaxy , which may be important for our understanding of the mechanism of sne type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) , as well as for the study of the interaction of the sn - ejecta with the surrounding interstellar medium . in the first part of this paper ,<n> we briefly describe the data , including the point - spread function ( psf ) and the sed , before focusing on the central region of the nebula , where we find evidence for the presence of a compact , collimated jet , with a fwhm of about 10 arcsec . from the psf<n> , we estimate the size of the jet to be about 3 times the diameter of the host galaxy . we study the effect of non - spherically symmetric density perturbations on the propagation of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisionless ( hic ) plasmas .<n> we find that , in general , the perturbations can significantly change the propagation speed of the collisionless plasma , making it more favorable for the plasma to propagate in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the perturbation . as a result ,<n> the velocity of the plasma can be significantly increased , which leads to the formation of a new type of shear layer called _ shear layer _<n> ( sl ) . <n> the shear layer is characterized by a density which is proportional to the distance from the collisional point of view , i.e. , @xmath0 , and a velocity which is inversely proportional to this density , such that the sl extends over a larger distance than the sl itself . in the case of axisymmetric plasmas<n> , it is expected that the density of the sl will be larger than that of the hic because of the azimuthal anisotropy of the equation of state ( eos ) of the fluid , as well as the anisotropic eos we report the discovery of a large number of blue -

variance behavior of a large class of tests . among others , the celebrated wald <n> wolfwitz ( lw ) theorem @xcite states that : _  _ the lw - optimality criterion can be written as follows . for any test @xmath0 on the real line , beta_i=0 $ ] , where alpha labelendarrayrightarrow,alpha ] are constants ; sigma_h,$ ] is the problem of detecting a single target using a radar interferometer is considered .<n> the target is assumed to change its position while being illuminated by the radar . a test for optimal sensitivity<n> is proposed , which consists of a sequence of two markov chains , one of which is stationary and the other non -

resolution elements are present , such as in airborne and satellite radar , as well as in space applications , where the relative velocity between target and radar the problem of detecting and estimating the trajectory of a moving target using a radar system is considered .<n> a sequential procedure is proposed , in which a finite number of radar resolution elements are used for target tracking and discretization of the continuous -

state quantum computation problem . here , the system is described by a gaussian noise model and the coefficients of the hamiltonian are given as binary variables . the estimation problem that we consider in this paper , we propose a new method for estimating the weighted mean and variance of generating functions of a system .<n> the method is based on the concept of typical set estimator , which is a generalization of the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) estimator . <n> let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional hilbert space and @xxmath1 be an ensemble of finitely many real - valued functions . in the _<n> typical set estimation _ @xcite , one estimates the mean and the variance of the generating function of the system by using two estimators , the typical set and the average of the functions , respectively , over the finite set . for a system described by a _  socket '' _ model ,<n> the estimators are defined over the ensemble of _pooling graphs _ of the same order as the system , while the variance estimation is defined over all _ pooling graphs_. in general , estimators based on typical set are provably _ not _ accurate . on the other hand , estimation based on ks estimators is proved to be _ in this paper , we present a typical set estimator for noise , which is based on a weighted sum of two generating functions .<n> this estimator is a generalization of the gaussian typical set ( gs ) estimator @xcite , and is more accurate than the gs estimator in the situation where the error of the first generating function is much smaller than that of the second generating function . as an example , in the case of @xmath0-noise , our estimator gives the error probability of event i ( i.e. , event i occurs when the noise is a typical sequence ) to be less than 1 . <n> we also present an estimator of the weighted average of the events . in this case<n> , the error probabilities of event ii and event iii are given to be 1 , 2 , or 3 , depending on the noise level , while the errors for event i and ii are given by the typical set estimate , respectively , when the error levels are 1 and 2 . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce the concept of _ typical set _ (  m - s  ) , where m is a set and s in this paper , we prove that the error probability of a bipartite quantum system interacting with a noisy environment is bounded from above by a constant independent of the noise level .<n> this result is used to derive a lower bound for the error probabilities of a pair of @xmath0-level quantum systems interacting with two different noisy environments . <n> _ introduction. _ quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite is one of the most important tools to improve the performance of quantum computation and communication protocols . in the context of qec<n> , it is important to understand the behavior of a quantum system under the combined influence of noise , environment , and dissipation . as an example , in ref.@xcite , bennett and brassard showed that for a qubit in a two - mode squeezed vacuum state , there is a tradeoff between the performance and the stability of the system . by taking the advantage of this connection ,<n> it has been shown that it is possible to compute the optimal error probability for a large class of qubit states , even in the presence of decoherence and dissipation in the environment . for a system with a large number of degrees of freedom , the in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the state of a discrete memoryless system from an observation that consists of a finite number of binary values .<n> we first consider the case where the system is _ noiseless _ ; i.e. , there is no group testing . in this case<n> , it is easy to show that the estimation error probability is bounded below by a constant that depends only on the number of the binary values of the observation . for the case of a _ noisy _ system ,<n> we show that this lower bound is equal to @xmath0 , where the constant is determined by the dimension of the underlying graph . <n> estimation theory has a long history , and it has a wide range of applications in many fields , such as financial analysis , telecommunications , medical imaging , resource planning , supply chain management , among others . the most common estimation problem in these fields<n> is given by the following : estimate the state ( or the parameter values ) of a system that has some unknown parameters ; for example , the position , momentum , or velocity of an object in the field can be estimated by using a the direct part theorem is generalized to the case of generalized noiseless systems .<n> it is shown that for any pair of @xmath0-pooling graphs , the error probability can be expressed in terms of the entropy function of the dms . as an application<n> , we derive a lower bound for the estimation error probability in a generalized version of the binary group testing problem . <n> estimation of unknown parameters in a system is a fundamental problem in many areas of science and engineering . in statistical mechanics ,<n> one of the most important estimation problems is given by the uncertainty principle @xcite , which states that one can not predict the value of a physical quantity with high probability with high precision . for the purpose of quantum information processing , it is important to be able to estimate the unknown parameters of a quantum system with high accuracy . to estimate a parameter of a system from the knowledge of its values , one usually performs a group testing , i.e. , testing the system s commutation relations , correlations , etc . a group test is defined as follows : given a set of values for some unknown parameter , select a subset of the values from the set to be tested the direct part theorem is a fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics .<n> it states that given a probability distribution @xmath0 on the state of a quantum system , one can estimate the values of the system s parameters with arbitrary accuracy . in this paper<n> , we prove a new theorem which provides a condition for arbitrary accuracy in estimation of the parameters of a given probability distribution . as an application<n> we derive a new lower bound on the average fidelity of a bell - state measurement . <n> quantum mechanics implies that a physical system can not be described by a single mathematical function @xcite . on the other hand ,<n> given a distribution of observables , it is natural to expect that the system can be approximated by a sum of the distribution of the observables and a weighted average of the individual values of these observables<n> . one of the most fundamental notions in quantum mechanics is the principle of symmetrization , which states that a system is  symmorphic '' if and only if it can be  approximated '' by a system in which the properties of each observable are independent of those of the others . for a given distribution of quantum observables ( e.g. @x in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the unknown parameters of a quantum system from a noisy input .<n> it is shown that the problem is np - hard in the general case , but it can be made tractable in the case of generalized noiseless systems with additive noise . as an application of the result ,<n> we discuss the estimation of the parameters of two gaussian quantum systems . <n> quantum estimation is one of the most challenging problems in quantum information theory . in the field of quantum error correction ( qec )<n> , it is of crucial importance to know the error rate of the estimation procedure . for a given error rate @xmath0 , the problem consists in estimating the value of the unknown parameter of the system @xcite . to solve this problem , one has to find the optimal estimation procedure for the given input , i.e. , an optimal estimation problem for the input itself , as well as for the noise in the noiseless system , which is the system to be estimated . the problem can be reduced to the following two steps : ( 1 ) finding the optimal input for the system ; ( 2 ) estimating the parameters in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the unknown function @xmath0 of a bernoulli noiseless system .<n> we prove two theorems which give the conditions for achieving arbitrarily small estimation error probabilities . as an application of these results ,<n> we derive the asymptotics of a group testing scheme for noiseless systems . <n> estimation error probability , group testing , sparse estimation , shannon s limit , ergodic noise .",

schechter ( cq ) mass function for dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . <n> we find that our model is in good agreement with the results from numerical simulations of structure formation , and that the model reproduces the observed uv luminosity function of mw galaxies at redshift zero , provided we use the ps mass function instead of the cq mass function . for comparison<n> we also compare the predictions of our model with those obtained from the sasaki formalism , for the same range of halo masses and redshift we study the effect of varying the shape of the st mass function on the evolution of outflows in a flat universe .<n> we find that the physical properties related to the outflows , such as porosity weighted average radius , porosity weighted peculiar velocity , metallicity etc . , do not differ significantly between the models with the st and sasaki formalism for the mass function . on the other hand ,<n> physical properties such as the average porosity weighted mass of the halos that contribute to the volume filling factor , and the temperature of the hot bubble , depend on the way we calculate the net formation rate . in the case of the ps mass function<n> , the average halo mass that contributes to the filling factor is slightly higher compared to that predicted by the sakurai - yoshida ( ps ) mass function for @xmath0 , due to the fact that smaller mass halos contribute dominantly to the porosity weighted mean mass . for the st<n> mass function the average mass of halos which contribute to this filling factor are slightly lower compared to those in the model with the tully - fisher ( tf ) and the derivative of the tf mass function @x we use the semi - analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies developed in paper i and ii , to calculate the observed uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies at @xmath0 and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .<n> we find that the model predictions are insensitive to the manner in which the net formation rate of high mass dark matter halos is computed , provided one uses the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function , the sasaki formalism for calculating the net halo formation rate , or the derivative of the ps mass function<n> . we also present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass functions . <n> # 1 # 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we show , by comparing the derivatives of all mass functions , that the historically used press - schechter mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function . therefore , significant differences can arise in model predictions made using the ps mass function and the other forms of the mass functions considered here .<n> we show the effect of this difference by ( i ) calculating the reionization history of the universe , ( ii ) fitting the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs , and ( iii ) determining the feedback of star formation on the igm . a @xmath0 analysis of the uv luminosity function at high redshift is presented .<n> we find that , contrary to the predictions of the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function , it is possible to construct a mass function that gives a reasonable fit to the data , with a net formation rate of halos in the range of 10@xmath1 to 10@n(z ) , which is comparable to that of the milky way halos . however , the derivative of the mass function to calculate the net halo formation rate , leads to a prediction of less than 10% volume filling factor for metals in the igm , in agreement with the results of paper ii . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory galaxies : formation galaxies , high -

( b ) the minimal length of such a pc is at least two ; and ( c ) for any pncflat of size less than two , there are at least three fundamental flats that are comparable in size to the fundamental flat of the least fundamental circuit of the other pnc flats . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain the following characterization of the minimal spanning circuits of size two : [ a ] there exists a spanning flat of size greater than two that does not contain the least element of a fundamental circuit in its pnc ; [ b ] for any fundamental flat in the pnc of size larger than two and for any number of fundamental flats in we prove that the minimality of two parallel circuits connecting two non - uniform matroids is the same as that of two spanning circuits . <n> the notion of minimality is fundamental in the theory of linear algebra .<n> it was introduced by bernoulli and shapiro @xcite , who showed that a sequence of @xmath0 linear algebra equations has a minimality that depends only on the basepoint of the parallel connection , and not on the length of the connection . in the linear algebra theory ,<n> the minimumity of a connection is the sum of the minimalities of all parallel connections of the sequence ; this is called the _ minimality principle_. in general , a connection has minimality if and only if it is _ connected _ , i.e. , it has no other minimality than that of its basepoint ; in this case , the basepoints are the fundamental flats of the corresponding matroid . for a sequence , _<n> any _ linear algebra equation has a minimum that depends on the number of basepoints , as well as on the connection length ; for example , there is a minimum for the square of we prove that if @xmath0 is a non - connected compact matroid , then the minimal connectivity @xcite of the set of all non - empty non - degenerate compact flat submatrices of the matroid is at least five .<n> this answers a question of edelsbrunner and steiner . <n> [ theorem]corollary the following question was raised during a discussion of the class of non - compact compact flat minkowski spaces : what is the minimum connectivity of the space of all compact non - open flat submmeee@xmath1 ? <n> it is well - known that a compact minkowski space is connected if and only if it is empty ; however , it is not clear whether a compact space of arbitrary dimension is connected . in this paper<n> , we will show that the following is not the case : a compact compact minowski space is not necessarily connected ; in fact , if it was so , there must be at least two non - disconnected compact minkowksi spaces that are connected , even if they are not compact . as a consequence ,<n> we show that if a compact riemannian space is compact , its min we present a family of spanning circuits that interpolate between reducible and incomparable pnc - flat @xmath0 .<n> the interpolating circuits are of the form , respectively , of a spanning circuit between two incomparable p nc - flats , or , equivalently , between two pnc-@xmath1-flats . <n> [ theorem]corollary the notion of a _ spanning circuit _<n> was introduced by john hutchings in his thesis , @xcite . in this paper<n> , we study the family of _ incomparable _ , _ pnc _ - flat , spanning circuits . for a circuit ,<n> we say that if it interpolates between a pair of incomparable flats , then it is incomparable , and vice versa . the characterization of  incomparable '' flats has been a topic of interest since the early days of the circuit theory . among others , there is a well - known characterization , due to alonso and shapiro , which states that , for any two incomparable ( or reducibility ) pnc flats of the same index @x we prove that every irreducible riemannian manifold @xmath0 with two fundamental flats has a dual .<n> more precisely , we show that there exists a fundamental flat of each fundamental flat in the dual of every flat of the first element of the dualfunder set of the fundamental flats . <n> the main result of this paper is an inequality @xcite . here ,<n> the second term of the integral of the second cohomology of a _<n> compact _ , _ smooth _ manifold is defined to be the difference of two cohomological matrices , each of which is a flat of another flat of that manifold . for a compact manifold , the inequality , known as the _ duality principle _ ( dp ) , states that , for any compact , smooth , self - adjoint , cocompact , minkowski space , there is a dual funder set . in the case<n> that the difference between the two fundamental flats of the manifold is equal to the sum of the squares of their integrals , this inequality is the well - known _ duality principle_. in this paper , our main result is we show that the only pnc - flats are those of @xmath0 , which are hyperplanes .<n> we also show that there are no fundamental flats of the smallest fundamental flat of any pnc flat . <n> introduction ------------ the study of topological insulators ( tis ) has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein , tis and others @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been a resurgence of interest in tis due to their connection to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , and their potential application to quantum information processing . while the tis have been extensively studied , it is only recently that they have been shown to give rise to interesting topological phenomena , namely , the fractional tis ( fti ) and the fqh . here<n> we will show that these phenomena are intimately related , even though they are quite different from each other . to do this , we will first briefly review the theory of ftis , then we will apply this theory to the case of the fti and then , using a different approach , introduce the ftis of a general class of flat , we show that the set of all uniform matroids that are contained in a fundamental flat @xmath0 is finite .<n> more specifically , we prove that the following are equivalent : ( i ) the fundamental flats of @ x are comparable to the fundamentalflats @xcite ; ( ii ) there is a finite chain of all fundamental flats that are incomparable to the chain of fundamental flats contained in x ; and ( iii ) all uniform matsroids are connected . <n> the notion of a matroid is introduced by john von neumann in his celebrated paper on the classification of circuits . in that paper , he showed that every circuit is contained in at least one matroid , and he conjectured that the number of circuit elements contained in all of them is infinite . the characterization of the number and the type of matroid elements of a given circuit is one of the fundamental problems in circuit theory . for a circuit @x<n> , it is known that there are only finitely many ways to start with a circuit , namely , a circuit with @x , @x,@xmath1 , as its input ; for a finite circuit @ x , we prove that the set of all disjoint fundamental flats of @xmath0 is a union of incomparable fundamental flats .<n> this generalizes the well - known result that the disjoint union of all fundamental flats is a disjoint set . as an application<n> , we show that the union of any two disjoint pnc - flat sets is a set of disjoint incomparable fundamental flat sets . <n> [ [ section ] ] the idea that disjoint sets are disjoint is at the core of the characterization of the unitary group , which is the basis of quantum mechanics . in the case of unitary groups @xcite ,<n> it is easy to see that the most general disjoint groups are the irreducible representations of the group . however , the situation is more complicated for nonunitary groups , and it is not clear how to generalize the notion of unitary group to nonunital groups . for instance , it is well known that the group is unitary if and only if it is disjoint from all the other groups it is a subset of . on the other hand , there is no equivalent notion of a unitary group in the language of quantum theory , so it is natural to",

like or multiple sources separated by a finite distance is presented .<n> this mechanism is capable of accounting for self - interference , as it is proven for a number of increasingly complex situations . in this paper , a quantum mechanical ( qm ) mechanism is presented for emission of particles from slit- or multiple - source scenarios , that is , from two or more separated sources , respectively , by finite - distance lattices , rings , or boxes . <n> the basic idea of qm is that particles should be prepared in such a way that , at each time step , the momentum of the emitted particle is recorded by a site - register , and the emitted bosons are represented by a discrete - valued stochastic variable , @xmath0 , whose expected value is a square - root function of the particle momentum . as a result , _<n> i ) _ the total momentum carried by the particle is equal to the boson momentum at the time step of the creation of the bosons ; _ ii ] _ there is no interference between the emission of the same number of bosons from two different sources ; we propose a model for particle production in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions , based on the stochastic preparation and detection of many identical bosonic particles .<n> the model is analogous to the well - known lattice in a ring \" scenario , but with infinitely many equally - probable and equally - likely particle sources . in the proposed model ,<n> all possible particle paths interefere , with a path difference that is always a multiple of the particle momentum . as a result<n> , the average particle motion is described by a square -

interference is proposed .<n> it consists of a ring with periodic boundary conditions , with infinitely many equally - probable and equally - spaced sources separated by a distance @xmath0 in lattice units . in the proposed scenario ,<n> the bosons are not free , but are submitted to external forces as soon as they hit the boundaries of the ring . as a result , the steady - state probability density function of the total momentum has a peak , which coincides precisely with the quantum - mechanical predictions derived in appendix a.6.6 , after transformation to lattice units<n> . the proposed model can be implemented numerically with a well - known algorithm . <n> the quantum mechanical ( qm ) theory of superconductivity @xcite is the foundation of modern physics . however , in its original formulation the qm was based on the superposition principle , whereas in the present formulation it is assumed that the particles are superpositions of many particles , each having its own momentum . due to this assumption<n> , it was not until the discovery of the bcs effect that qm predictions were derived for the superfluid - to - solid transition . since then , q a model for self - interference is proposed , based on the observation that the frequency distribution of particles emitted by an ensemble of sources tends to a priori expected values as the number of sources in the ensemble increases .<n> it is shown that the interference pattern builds up in a time @xmath0 , and that it is characterized by a frequency ratio @xcite . in the two - slit scenario ,<n> the interference ratio is given by , for example , the value of the frequency ratio in a ring , while in the three - slit case , it is given in terms of the ratio of the frequencies in a two - dimensional lattice . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , i am interested in the possibility of building up a pattern of interferences in a system of many particles , such as in a quantum - mechanical ( qm ) system , with a finite number of bosons , e.g. , in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , as a result of the interaction with a thermal bath , or , more generally , due to the interaction of the bosons with other bosons of the same species , a new model of particle creation in the continuum limit is presented .<n> it is shown that the model is capable of describing trajectories of individual particles in a simple and realistic way , and it is also capable of integrating external forces into the picture . in the proposed model ,<n> particles are represented by real particles , a real discrete spacetime lattice , both capable of storing and exchanging a few pieces of information and arithmetic operations . <n> particle creation is one of the most important unsolved problems of modern physics . since the seminal works of bohm , hiley and wheeler in the 1950s @xcite , this problem has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research . during the last decades , particle creation has been studied in a wide range of contexts , from cosmology to high - energy physics , condensed - matter physics and computer science , to name a few . despite the vast amount of work that has been done , there are still many open questions to be answered , among which are : what is the nature of the particles that are created ? what are their intrinsic properties ?<n> are there any external forces acting on them ? <n> the answer to the first of these questions the schrdinger equation is derived from newtonian mechanics .<n> it is shown that , in contrast to the usual interpretation , it is not sufficient for a particle to have a definite intrinsic momentum to be considered as a particle , and that persistent forces must also be considered . in the proposed model ,<n> a particle is associated with a matter wave , whose frequency is proportional to its energy via the planck constant . <n> quantum mechanics is based on the postulates of symmetries and conservation laws , to be contrasted with classical mechanics , which was derived from the works of bekenstein , hawking , gibbons and others . since then , emergent quantum mechanics ( eqm ) has been developed and applied to a wide range of problems in physics , ranging from the derivation of the laws of thermodynamics to the simulation of quantum systems @xcite , from single photons to the measurement of the radiation emitted from astrophysical objects such as the earth s atmosphere . from the first moment of time , quantum mechanics has been understood as the evolution of a physical system described by the wavefunction @xmath0 , the probability density function of which is given by @x we propose a lattice gas model for wave propagation , in which the frequency is related to the average return time to a site of the lattice .<n> the model is an extension of the well - known chen - doolen s simple lattice gas models . in the proposed model ,<n> a particle is associated with a matter wave , whose frequency is proportional to its energy via the planck constant . as a result<n> , the frequency can be retrieved as the reciprocal of the _ return time _ to any position of the structure . <n> the frequency of a wave @xmath0 is defined as the probability that a particle , having energy @xcite , is at a site @x<n> fracsum_n=1inftynp  gammasqrt2$ ] with probability @x , where the variables are the particle s energy , momentum , position , velocity , time , etc . for a particle moving on a lattice at constant speed , its _ average _<n> return time is equal to the time it takes for the particle to cross the lattice at a given speed . the frequency in this letter , i propose a new approach to the study of topological properties of spacetimes .<n> this approach is based on the concept of a fundamental lattice , which is the set of points in spacetime that can be reached by an experimenter s particle . for a particle moving on the fundamental lattice<n> , it is possible to define a particle stochastic variable , whose probability density follows the binomial distribution with @xmath0 trials . using this definition ,<n> i show that , for any spacetime , the probability density of the particle is proportional to the number of sites in that spacetime where the particle can reach a certain probability of success . as a result , in the case of a nonrelativistic particle moving in a spacetime whose fundamental lattice is infinitely large , there is no particle probability density . <n> _ introduction. _ in recent years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the problem of how spacetime geometry and topology affect the properties of quantum systems @xcite . in particular , one of the most important questions that has been addressed in this context is the relation between the topology of spacetime and the dynamics of quantum particles . the we show that the probability density function ( pmf ) of a particle diffusing on a ring can be expressed as the solution of the schrdinger equation for a single plane wave of a well - defined wavenumber and momentum .<n> the wavefunction has the same form as the particle in a ring \" scenario , however , with opposite amplitudes for the forward and backward waves . in the case where the sources are equally probable ,<n> the pmf is the same as the one for a free particle . <n> _ introduction _ the study of stationary states of many - body systems is one of the cornerstones of modern statistical physics , as it is the starting point for the derivation of the laws of thermodynamics as well as for the construction of microscopic models of complex systems @xcite . for a stationary state of a system<n> , there is a probability density , @xmath0 , that describes the probability that the system is found at some given location , independently of the state of the system as a whole , provided that the state is invariant under time evolution , i.e. under the action of an external field . from this probability density<n> one can derive the probability distribution of it is shown that the backward and forward waves of a charged particle in a ring can be described by the same wavefunction , provided the ring radius is much smaller than the length of the bosonic ring .<n> this result is valid for bosons with any number of species , including fermions . <n> the wavefunctions of charged particles in rings have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in particular , the amplitudes of the forward and backward waves , @xmath0 ,<n> have been found to be the same , i.e. , equal , for any particle of the same species . however , in the case of bosons , these amplitudes are different , with the backward wavefunction having a smaller amplitude than the forward one . as a result<n> , it has been conjectured that the amplitude of the backward , or the forward , wavefunction is the same for all charged particles . here<n> i show that this is not the case , by proving that for a particle of a given species the amplitude in the backward direction is equal to that in the forward direction , if the particle is located at a distance of the order of the we study the statistics of the decays of massive scalar bosons into fermion pairs in the framework of the standard model .<n> it is shown that the decay probabilities depend not only on the number of fermions but also on the lifetime of the bosons . as a result<n> , the decay statistics can be very different from that of the radiative decay . <n> pacs numbers : 12.20.ds , 02.30.ik , 03.65.db , 14.60.pq the study of decay statistics of quantum particles has become an important topic in recent years @xcite . in particular ,<n> bosonic decays have been of great interest because of the possibility of observing them in the laboratory as well as in other places , such as quantum dots , bose -

resonant dsarrs we employ a coupled - fano model , in which the scattering between the two meta - modes is described by a random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the scattering amplitude . <n> the fano effect @xcite is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide range of phenomena , such as photosynthesis , molecular aggregates , surface plasmon polaritons ( sps ) @x we report on the observation of coupled -

field couplings to the subradiance oscillator . by varying the distance between the two dipoles<n> , we can control the powers of the two independent oscillators as well as the extinction spectrum of the combined system . <n> control over the absorption of light is essential for a wide range of applications in science and technology , such as sensing , metrology , energy conversion , quantum information processing , etc@xcite . in these applications ,<n> the control of the absorption spectrum is of great importance , as it not only enables the conversion of energy from one type of matter to another , but also allows one to manipulate the absorbed power by adjusting the properties of the medium , e.g. , temperature , magnetic field , material properties , or external fields . here<n> we show that the control over absorption spectrum can be achieved by controlling the couplings of two superradiance dipoles ( srrs )  the fano effect is a ubiquitous phenomenon in photonic crystals .<n> it manifests itself in fano resonances of photonic crystals in the presence of near - field couplings . in this work ,<n> we report the observation of the asymmetric fano dip in the spectra of the coupled dipoles of double - fano photonic crystal resonators ( dsrrs ) , which is caused by the coupling of the subradiant oscillator of the resonator with a common oscillator residing in a common plasmonic resonance . <n> photonic crystals are widely used in photonic quantum information processing @xcite , quantum communication @xmath0 , and quantum simulation of quantum many - body systems , such as the quantum hall effect @x<n> . however , they are also of interest in their own right , as well as in the context of fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , e.g. , in the relation between the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition and the existence of superconductivity in solids . to fully exploit the potential of these systems<n> , it is necessary to understand the properties of their constituent elements , i.e , the constituents of photonic crystal resonances  * plasmonic superradiant and subradiant modes can be coupled to each other through plasmon - assisted fano and double fano resonances , respectively .<n> however , it is still an open question whether such near - field couplings can lead to destructive interference , i.e. , induce destructive interference between superradiance and its own subradiance , and whether they can induce absorbed power . here<n> we report on the experimental observation of such destructive interference in plasmodynamically coupled superradiancy and plasmic subradiancy , in the form of fano dip and extinction enhancement , using plasme - based nano - resonators . in the presence of near field coupling<n> , we find that the fano interference is suppressed and the extinction enhancement is enhanced , as compared to the uncoupled case , but the absorbed power of dipole oscillators can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath0 . <n> * * _ introduction : _ plas mram resonances @xcite play a crucial role in the development of photonics as they are able to provide strong couplings between the individual optical degrees of freedom , such as pla we study the phase evolution of superradiant and subradiant oscillators in a double -

definite , and the dip is accompanied by a transfer of powers from one dipole to the other . <n> _ introduction_.radiative transfer in photonic crystals has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . in the simplest model , a two - level system composed of dipoles and plasmons<n> is coupled to a common near - field medium , such as a dielectric waveguide , dielectric slab , or slab of refractive index @xmath0@xmath1 . for a perfect two - dimensional waveguide<n> , it is well known that the fano effect , i.e. , the emission and absorption of radiation by the same fano mode , can be described by the lieb - liniger model@ xcite  we report on the observation of double fano resonances in a metamaterial system consisting of a tripod metamaterial and two superradiant dipoles .<n> the extinction spectra of the two dipoles show coherent effects resulting from near - field couplings of the dipoles to a common subradiant oscillator in the metamaterial . <n> plasmonics is a rapidly growing field of research @xcite , which has a broad range of potential applications , ranging from sensing to the development of ultra - stable electronic circuits . among them<n> , plasmon polaritons ( ps ) are very interesting because of their unique properties , such as their strong light - matter interaction and the possibility to control them by means of electric fields . in ps devices ,<n> one of the most important features is the ability to control the ps phase , in particular , through the control of two ps phases , one of which is @xmath0 , the phase of the electric field in the plane orthogonal to the plane of ps polarization . as a result , ps have been successfully used in various ps sensors@xcite such as inertial sensors , inertial reference systems , and inertial we report on the excitation of subradiant modes in a metamaterial system consisting of a dielectric slab ( mm@xmath0 ) coupled to a resonant waveguide ( frr ) .<n> we use a four - dimensional real - space - time ( fdtd ) method to describe the electric field distribution of near - field couplings of two superradiant oscillators ( srs ) and a subradiance oscillator ( dsrr ) to a common oscillator in a tripod metamaterial , and to identify the multipolar nature of coherent coupling between them . <n> plamonic excitations in metamaterials have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite . in particular ,<n> the interest in tripod metamaterials has been stimulated by the possibility of using them as nonlinear optical elements for photonic and optoelectronic applications . among the various metamaterial systems , a particularly promising one<n> is the so - called double - superradiance metamaterial(dsrr)@xcite which consists of a thin ( @xmath1 ) dielectric slab coupled to two resonant waveguides ( frss ) of josephson junction arrays . as a result<n> , it has been shown that by embedding four - rod resonators inside double - split ring resonators superlattice , a composite metamaterial system is introduced , where a common subradiant oscillator in four - rods is coupled with two superradiant resonators to give rise to double fano resonances . as a classical analogue of four - level atomic system , the extinction spectrum of the composite metamaterials exhibits a doublefano - based coherent effect .<n> we also show that the extinction spectra of the composites exhibit the multipolar nature of excitations , which is confirmed by fdtd simulation . <n> * introduction. * recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the field of optoelectronics due to its potential applications in sensing , metrology , and quantum information processing @xcite . in these applications ,<n> it is important to understand the nature of multipolar excitations in a given material system . for example , in a superconductor , an excitation mode in the normal state is suppressed by a coupling with the superconductor due to the superconductivity . on the other hand<n> , it is expected that the excitation mode of a material system can be coherently coupled with other modes due to we introduce a composite metamaterial system by embedding four - rod resonators inside double - split ring resonators superlattice , where two superradiant oscillators are embedded in the ring resonator to give rise to double fano resonances . as a classical analogue of four - level tripod atomic system , the extinction spectrum of the composite metamaterials exhibits a coherent effect due to the interplay of two coupling strengths , @xmath0 and @xcite , which shows up as a transfer of absorbed power from one subradiant dipole to the other superradiance dipole in double -split ring resonator .<n> the composite system can be used to design plasmonic resonances of metamaterial to engineer coherent effects in metamaterials . in recent years , there has been significant progress in the development of metamaterials with novel properties and applications , such as light - matter interaction in photonics and optoelectronics , low - dimensional photonic crystals , and low - loss metamaterials@xcite<n> . however , it is still a great challenge to realize the full potential of these metamaterials due to their high intrinsic nonlinearities , weak coupling strengths and the lack of controllability , especially for the coherent effects  double electromagnetically induced transparency ( ede ) is a versatile and powerful technique for optical phase control . here<n> , we report the experimental demonstration of ede in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) plasmonic metamaterial consisting of a metamaterial - liquid crystal cell structure .<n> the ede is achieved by two excitation pathways of the plasmon dark mode , which are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations and analytical calculations . <n> the ability to control and manipulate light - matter interactions is essential for a variety of applications @xcite . in the field of optoelectronics ,<n> the control of light propagation through metamaterials is of great importance for the development of optical phase gates @xmath0 , such as optical switches , polarizing phase gates , and optical rulers . for the manipulation of light , it is important to control the phase of the incident light . to achieve this goal , the use of electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) @xxcite has become a popular and versatile technique due to its inherent simplicity , ease of implementation , as well as the fact that it does not require any external control or feedback to be applied  we propose a new type of plasmonic resonance , which we call a dual - spectral plasmon - induced transparency ( dtap ) .<n> dtap consists of two electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit ) resonances , one near infrared ( ir ) and one far - infrared ( fir ) spectral region , and can be used to switch between these two spectral regions . in this paper<n> , we study the properties of dtap based on the ir - fir spectral region of a split - ring metamaterial resonator , where we find that the dtap can be switched from the fir to ir spectral region with a frequency shift of the order of @xmath0 hz , depending on the relative phase between the two eit resonances and the polarization of the incident light . <n> plasmic resonances ( prrs ) are electromagnetically induced metamaterials that consist of an array of evanescently - coupled metamaterial elements @xcite , such as wires , rods , sheets , cylinders , etc .,@xcite and have been studied in various applications such as terahertz ( thz ) metamaterials @ the characteristic asymmetric line shape of plasmonic fano resonances is retained when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are externally driven .<n> we show that the asymmetric peak in excitation spectra observed near autoionization discrete energy level overlapping with continuum energy level of helium can be retained when the coupling between the two oscillators is switched on . <n> electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is one of the most important techniques for the characterization of nanostructures and metamaterials @xcite . in eit<n> , the electromagnetic field is split into two components , one associated with the charge carriers and the other with the electromagnetic modes . for a single carrier mode ,<n> the spectrum is well - known as fano s law , which states that the line width is the sum of the two contributions to the local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath0 , divided by the charge - carrier lifetime . when two carriers are excited at the same energy level , their ldos are decoupled , and the ldos of the first carrier is proportional to the energy of the second carrier . as a result , in a double - fano - resonance system ( ds we study the fano line shape of plasmonic resonances in the presence of coherent driving by adopting a simple mechanical two coupled oscillators model .<n> it is shown that the asymmetric line shape is retained even when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are externally driven . in a dark plasmon ,<n> an interference between the bright and dark oscillators leads to an asymmetric fano resonance line shape , which is characterized by 3 parameters , the resonance shift , resonance width , and the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 . <n> the common perception that fano - like interferences between superradiance and dark excitations lead to fano lines in atomic spectroscopy has been questioned by gallinet _ et _ al . @xcite and martin _<n> et al _ @x<n> , who showed that a far - field interference of the two oscillators gives rise to asymmetric line shapes in the excitation spectra of a driven dark mode . here<n> we raise the question whether fano interferences are retained in a plas monic system , even when driven simultaneously by a bright and a dark oscillator . to this end , we examine how the broad lorentzian we study the fano resonance line shape of a driven superradiant oscillator coupled to a narrow subradiant one by a simple mechanical two coupled oscillators model .<n> we find that the asymmetric fano line shape is not necessarily retained even in the presence of an external coherent coupling between the oscillators . <n> [ [ section ] ] the idea of an asymmetric line shape resonance in plasmonic structures has been extensively studied in the literature , see e.g. ref . @xcite . in this context , it has been argued that an interference between spectrally and spatially overlapping eigenmodes arising from coherent coupling of oscillators can give rise to an asymmetric resonance . here<n> we raise the question whether this idea is still valid even when both oscillators are driven coherently . to this end<n> , we examine the coupling of a superradiance oscillator to a driven narrow oscillator by using a two - coupled oscillator model and find that a dark mode , which is an example of non - driven narrow resonance , is not required for the existence of a fano resonant line shape . *<n> pacs number(s ) * : 42.25.bs , 42.65",

chosen natural frequencies on a given network ; and ( iii ) building a network for a given set of natural frequencies . in particular , we show that the generalized sf can be used to optimize synchronization under several constraints : the number of oscillators , the coupling strength , and the network topology . for instance , for undirected networks , optimizing synchronization requires choosing the natural frequencies of all oscillators in the network with equal probability ; however , optimization with respect to natural frequencies can be accomplished with high probability if the network has a low degree of frustration . we observe that synchronization is promoted by a strong , positive correlation between the nodal in - degrees and magnitude of the natural frequency , while a negative correlation between them has comparatively little effect . <n> we also study the dynamical and topological properties of synchrony - optimized networks and find that optimizing synchronization is not limited to choosing the frequencies , but we derive a generalized version of the kuramoto synchrony index and show that it can be used to optimize the properties of networks that support strong synchronization of nonlinear oscillators . in particular , we show that a network s optimal phase - locked state can be obtained by maximizing the standard deviation of the natural frequencies of the oscillators over a pre - determined set of natural frequencies .<n> we also show that the generalized kuramatsu index allows us to study the effects of directed network structure and the relationship between the dynamical and structural properties of synchrony - optimized networks . <n> strong synchronization is a widespread phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide range of fields , including biology , chemistry , physics , engineering , social sciences , computer science , and biology @xcite . as such , strong synchronization has been studied extensively , both experimentally and theoretically , in order to understand the mechanisms underlying its occurrence , as well as to optimize its properties . to date , most of the research on strong synchronization focuses on the case of undirected networks , which are difficult to optimize due to the high dynamical complexity of the problem . however , there is a growing interest in the use of directed networks we present a generalized synchrony alignment function ( saf ) for directed networks , which encodes the interplay between the local oscillator dynamics and the network structure , and can be used to optimize synchronization analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints .<n> we demonstrate the utility of the generalized sf in optimizing synchronization in directed networks for several classes of constraints : ( i ) the mean synchronization @xmath0 is not necessarily equal to the mean collective frequency of the synchronized population ; ( ii ) if the collective frequency is equal , then the _ generalized synchronization alignment function _ ( _ gsa _ ) encodes this interplay and can serve as an objective measure of the degree of synchronization for a given network ; and ( iii ) in the case of a directed network , the order parameter of the collective dynamics is not a mean but is given by a weighted average of the entries of the singular values of the moore - penrose pseudoinverse . <n> synchronization of oscillators on a network is a fundamental problem in nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite and plays an important role in biological , technological and social contexts . in particular , synchronization is central to the synchronization of coupled oscillators is an important problem in many natural , social , and technological systems . here , we show that a generalized version of the synchronization allocation function ( saf ) can be used to optimize the synchronization properties of directed networks , even when the underlying network is not undirected .<n> we demonstrate the utility of the generalized sef by studying three classes of constrained optimization problems : ( i ) allocation of natural frequencies given a fixed network ; ( ii ) arrangement of a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies ; and ( iii ) construction of a network for a given pre - selected natural frequency set . <n> synchronization is a fundamental problem in natural and social systems @xcite . in the natural world ,<n> the synchronization of oscillators plays an important role in the dynamics of many important processes , such as the movement of ants on a track @xmath0 or the control of neurons in a neuron network , to name a few . for the past two decades , it has been recognized that synchronization is essential for the proper functioning of many biological and physical systems , as well as for the timely development of information - rich technologies . however , there is we investigate synchronization in complex networks of coupled oscillators .<n> we show that the optimal allocation of oscillators to nodes of a given network is determined by the average degree of the network , the coupling strength between oscillators and nodes , and the normal distribution of natural frequencies . for networks with a given mean degree , we develop a simple greedy algorithm to find the optimal oscillator allocation , which outperforms a random allocation by a factor of @xmath0 over a range of coupling strengths . <n> complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology . in biology , for example , living cells are connected to one another by means of gene regulatory networks @xcite , while in physics , such as the earth s atmosphere , complex networks play an important role in the formation and evolution of life , from the early universe to the present day . the study of complex networks has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of sakaguchi and kuramoto in the 1950 s @x<n> . however , it has been recently recognized that the dynamics of real - world networks are far from simple , due to the ubiquitous presence of complex dynamical components , e.g. , oscillator synchronization is a process by which a complex dynamical system synchronizes itself , and is central to many phenomena in natural and technological systems .<n> we consider the problem of constructing a network that best synchronizes a collection of coupled oscillators , a task that has been studied extensively . here , we show that a simple greedy algorithm can be used to find an approximation of the optimal solution , even in the presence of a large number of possible solutions and arbitrarily large order parameters . <n> we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by simulating the dynamics of synchronization on networks of different sizes , including artificial neural networks and artificial insect swarms . in recent years<n> , much attention has been devoted to the study of synchronization in complex dynamical systems @xcite , particularly in the context of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , in which a system s collective behavior is determined by a small number of dynamical parameters , such as the number of oscillators in the system , @xmath0 , the coupling strength between the oscillators and the frequency vector of the other dynamical parameters ( e.g. , temperature , pressure , current , etc .. ) and the time - scale @ synchronization is a fundamental problem in network science , accounting for the activity patterns of complex networks , their robustness to perturbations , and the ability of a system to respond rapidly to changes in the environment . here , we investigate the effects of network structure on the performance of synchronization algorithms .<n> we present a generalized synchronization algorithm , which optimizes network synchronization properties by minimizing the synchronization error function ( saf ) , i.e. , the difference between the average synchronization profiles of networks with the same number of connections and those with different numbers of connections . using numerical simulations ,<n> we demonstrate that the generalized algorithm is effective in optimizing a variety of network properties , including degree assortativity , frequency distribution , degree clustering , assortative and disassortative degree correlations , random and directed network structure . <n> synchronization is one of the most important problems in the study of complex systems @xcite . in this problem , a network<n> is modeled as a collection of connected components , such as nodes , edges , ports , relays , or links , where each component is used to perform some function of the network . to optimize a network s synchronization properties synchronization in complex systems is often achieved through optimization of a small number of network parameters . here , we study the effect of degree assortativity on synchrony in directed networks , and show that positive / negative degree as sortativity does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties . in particular , when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform assortative ones .<n> however , in the case of heavy - tailed frequency distributions , optimal allocation of oscillators leads to the emergence of an optimal synchronization regime characterized by a continuous and piecewise - smooth degree distribution . <n> synchronization in a variety of complex systems has been studied over the past few decades @xcite . among the diverse phenomena that have been studied , synchronization in real - world systems<n> has been recently investigated in the context of complex networks @x<n> . for example , the study of synchronization in artificial neural networks has shed light on the role of network heterogeneity in the synchronization properties of such systems . also recently , there has been an increasing interest in studying the effects of optimization on synchronization in networks . to date , most of the research on synchronization has focused on optimizing the size of a network s we investigate synchronization of nonlinear oscillators on directed networks .<n> we consider two cases : ( i ) optimal synchronization in which all oscillators have the same natural frequency , and ( ii ) synchrony optimization in which each oscillator s natural frequency is rewired to optimize the synchronization of its neighbors . in both cases , we find that in - degrees play a significant role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . for the case of optimal synchronization ,<n> we observe the emergence of nodes with very large in - degree compared to the rest of the network , or hubs ; however , these results are in close agreement with our study of synchrony - optimized networks arising for the optimization problem of rearranging a set of pre - chosen frequencies on a given network . <n> synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature@xcite and plays an important role in a wide range of applications , ranging from cell biology to the brain . while synchronization has been studied for a long time , it is only recently that we have a comprehensive understanding of the role of network structure in promoting optimal synchronization properties @xcite . to this end<n> , there has been considerable interest in we study the correlations between the natural frequencies of individual harmonic oscillators on directed and undirected networks .<n> we find that natural frequencies are correlated not only with their nodal in- and out - degrees , but also with their mean in - frequency , out - degree , as well as their correlation with the nodal frequencies of neighboring oscillators . in the undirected case ,<n> we observe that the relationship between natural frequencies and in - degrees has a stronger effect on synchronization than the relationship with their respective mean out - frequencies . _<n> _ introduction.__ synchronization is one of the most important dynamical phenomena in nature @xcite . for a variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems , synchronization<n> is quantified by the frequency of the oscillations , called the natural frequency @xmath0 , with respect to the mean frequencies of the individual oscillators ( the so - called nodal degrees ) , which are defined as the frequencies in absolute value for each oscillator s nodal degree . here<n> , we focus on oscillators in a network , specifically on those oscillators that are connected by a fixed number of links , the network s nodes , or links between we develop a framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators .<n> our main theoretical result is the derivation of the generalized synchrony alignment function given by eq . , which we have shown can be used to systematically optimize the synchronizent properties of networks under several constraints , including oscillator allocation , oscillator arrangement , and network construction . finally , we investigate the evolution of a network s properties during the optimization process . in recent years , much attention has been devoted to the study of synchronization in complex networks @xcite . here ,<n> we focus on the case of optimally rewired networks , where the goal is to maximize the kuramoto order parameter @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the in- and out - degrees of the oscillator s natural frequency vector , over the course of a single network realization . for context , the order parameter of an undirected network was shown to be a superposition of the degrees and natural frequencies of all network realizations @x<n> . however , it was recently shown that the properties of undirected networks strongly depend on the number of switches and the arrangement of oscillators in the network , suggesting that the optimal we have developed an approach to maximize the kuramoto order parameter in synchrony - optimized directed networks .<n> this approach does not require large - scale simulation of dynamics , and is based on an objective measure of synchronization . in comparison to undirected networks , optimized networks display stronger synchronization properties , in particular , stronger alignments of the natural frequency vector with the left singular vectors of the laplacian , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values . we have also studied the effects that structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks have on optimal synchronization ; it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization , while the relationship between the nodal in - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency has comparatively little effect . to provide further insight into the mechanisms that enhance synchronization and the role of directedness , we studied correlations between the natural frequencies of neighbors on directed networks and found that directed networks display a stronger relationship between each natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links than its neighbors on out - going links . taken together , these results indicate that in - degrees play a significant role in the synchronization we study the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator in the presence of a periodic potential .<n> we show that the periodicity of the system can be controlled by the phase shift of the potential , which can be achieved by tuning the amplitude of the oscillation . for a fixed phase shift @xmath0<n> , we find that the system is always in a stationary state , with the periodic modulation of the amplitude and phase of the oscillations . <n> nonlinear oscillators have been studied for a long time @xcite , and a large body of work has been devoted to the study of such systems . in recent years , the interest in such systems has increased , due to the realization that they can be used to model a wide range of phenomena , from biological oscillations to the behavior of complex networks . from a theoretical point of view , it is very useful to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of nonlinear oscillations , as well as to understand their properties . on the other hand ,<n> it is also very interesting to study the properties of such a system in the nonlinear regime , since it is the simplest model of a dynamical system . to this end , in the last few years a large number of we present a new method to compute the ground state degeneracy of the hamiltonian @xmath0 on the triangular lattice .<n> the method is based on the solution of the linearized equations of motion in the limit of vanishing coupling constants . in this limit<n> , we recover the well - known linearized equation of motion , which is known to have a non - trivial ground state configuration . as a consequence ,<n> our method can be used to determine the non - linearized eigenvalue spectrum and eigenfunctions of the corresponding hamiltonians . <n> one of the most important problems in theoretical physics is the study of the properties of non - perturbative many - body systems @xcite . to solve this problem , one usually resorts to perturbation theory , a technique that has been very successful in the past . however , perturbation theory is not suitable for all non - interacting systems , due to the fact that , in general , non - local interactions are present in the system , and therefore , it is not clear how to generalize perturbation theory to the case of interacting many - particle systems . the most common approach to study non - abelian systems<n> is we study the phase diagram of the one - dimensional kuramoto - sakaguchi model in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> we find that the phase boundary between the ordered and disordered phases is determined by the ratio of the coupling constants of the model . in the case of a homogeneous magnetic field<n> , the ordered phase is found to be separated from the disordered phase by a first - order transition , while in the non - homogeneous case the phase transition is of second - order . <n> one of the most important problems in the study of quantum phase transitions is to find the phase boundaries between the disordered and ordered phases @xcite . on the one hand ,<n> it is important to determine the critical point @xmath0 , where the transition is from a disordered phase to an ordered phase , and on the other hand it is also important to study the critical behavior of the system near the transition point . for a given system , it is well known that the order of the transition depends on the dimension of the hilbert space , i.e. , on the number of degrees of freedom . however , there is no simple relation between the order and the dimension , which is",

insulator @x ion - superconductor systems @x<n> _ etc_. in particular , it has been used to study the effect of small changes in temperature and/or interaction strength on the behavior of a variety of molecular and supermolecular systems , such as , for example , clusters and multi - component superconductor , which we investigate the performance of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm for the simulation of lattice qcd .<n> we apply it for the first time to the cp@xmath0model , a lattice gauge theory with topological charge @xmath1 , for a wide range of values of the coupling constants , from the chiral limit to the deconfinement phase transition . in all cases , we find that the hmc with field transformation converges faster than hmc without field transformation , and that the resulting autocorrelation times for several observables are in good agreement with the literature . <n> lattice gauge theories ( lfts ) @xcite are among the first non - perturbative approaches to the description of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite . as such , they have become a standard tool for experimentalists as well as theorists who wish to study the properties of qcd at finite chemical potentials . among the many qcd models ,<n> the one studied most extensively and extensively in the last years is the chirally symmetric ( cp ) , chirally anti - symmetric ( ca ) model , which has been the subject of much theoretical and we study the phase diagram of a chiral @xmath0 superconductor using a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) and a finite - size scaling approach .<n> we compare the results of hmc with those of a trivializing flow and a field transformation . in the chiral limit , we find that the phase transition is first order , but the transition temperature is higher than expected from qcd . <n> the chiral phase transition ( cpt ) is one of the most important phenomena in superconductors @xcite . at zero temperature ,<n> the order of the transition is determined by the topology of the fermi surface ( fs ) , while at finite temperature it is controlled by the chemical potential , which is the quantity most relevant for the physics of the cuprates . as a consequence<n> , it is expected that the critical temperature of the superconductor is strongly affected by chiral symmetry breaking , and that the transition becomes of first order at sufficiently high temperatures . on the other hand , at low temperatures , the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , leading to the formation of a gap in the phase space , as observed in several experiments . for a long time<n> it has we present a method to reduce the autocorrelation times of molecular dynamics simulations by a factor of two or more , depending on the observable considered .<n> the method is based on a field transformation that reduces the number of steps in the euler integration of the molecular dynamics , while maintaining the same molecular dynamics step size . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of cp@xmath0 and @xmath1 , where we find that the force reduction can be as large as 60% . <n> molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have become a very powerful tool in the study of non - equilibrium processes in condensed matter @xcite . in particular , they have been used to investigate non - linear processes such as the formation of superconductors and the dynamics of cooper pairs in superfluids @x<n> . however , the cost of the simulation is also very high , in the order of tens of thousands of dollars per simulation . to reduce this cost , it is important to find methods that can reduce the simulation cost as much as possible . among these<n> is the use of a molecular dynamics system with a large number of degrees of freedom , such as a hybrid monte carlo we demonstrate that the metropolis monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm with field transformation can be used to simulate nonequilibrium steady states of strongly correlated lattice models with periodic boundary conditions .<n> in particular , we study the critical slowing down of the hmc algorithm in the presence of a topological phase transition and find that the autocorrelation times can be reduced by about a factor of two compared to hmc without field transformation . in the topological phase ,<n> the topological charge is exponentially slow in the correlation length , which results in a severe reduction of the correlation times . <n> _ introduction. _ the field transformation ( ft ) method @xcite has become a standard tool in the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions , where it is known to be applicable to a large variety of systems , ranging from first -

statistics monte carlo ( hmc ) simulation of the @xmath0 hubbard model in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> our data cover a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields , allowing us to study the behavior of various observables , such as the topological charge , the magnetic susceptibility , and the autocorrelation function of the spin susceptibility . <n> _ introduction _ the study of interacting many - body quantum systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . in condensed matter physics ,<n> the problem is particularly challenging in the context of strongly correlated quantum systems , where the coupling to the environment or the interaction with other degrees of freedom can be strong , leading to a variety of complex phenomena , including thermalization and deconfinement , phase transitions and chiral symmetry breaking . at the same time , it is also of interest to study interacting systems close to a critical point , which is not well described by the mean - field theory , due to the possibility of thermalization , localization and delocalization . for a description of strongly interacting quantum systems<n> , one usually has to resort to the mean field approximation we perform high - statistics monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations of the one - dimensional @xmath0 ising model on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions .<n> we vary the strength of the field transformation , the ratio of the correlation length to the magnetic susceptibility , and the number of lattice spacings . for all these observables , we find that the hmc algorithm is more efficient than the thmc algorithm by a factor of about two . <n> _ introduction _ one of the most important problems in the study of strongly correlated quantum systems is the determination of the asymptotic behavior of the many - body green s function in the thermodynamic limit . in this context ,<n> the ising universality class is of central importance , as is the question of the nature of the low - temperature phase transition , which is a fundamental issue in quantum statistical mechanics . at the heart of this question is the isotropy of the hamiltonian @xcite , i.e. the difference between the energy and the mean - field value of the corresponding eigenvalue . as a consequence , in one dimension , it is well known that the phase transition is of first order and we propose a field transformation for the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc ) , which has been successfully applied to the study of qcd with dynamical fermions .<n> the transformation reduces the number of dynamical degrees of freedom , but does not change the scaling behavior of the observables . for observables which are not affected by the topological charge , the improvement factor is close to the additional cost of the hmc algorithm . <n> recently , several authors have proposed field transformations for hmc which can lead to a speed - up in the simulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . in particular , it has been suggested that the hybrid algorithm ( hmca ) can be used to study the qcd phase diagram in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath0 , where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken.@xcite here we investigate the effect of such field transformations on the performance of two different algorithms , hmc and the recently proposed symplectic hmc ( smhmc , for short ) for the calculation of observables in qcd such as the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , etc . as an example<n> , we consider",

tested measures , but to introduce also other measures which have been recently presented in the literature and may be useful in capturing properties of the time series<n> . mats exploits the graphical user interface ( gui ) of mats to establish a user - friendly environment and visualization facilities . in the computation of some methods , functions in the signal processing , system identification and statistics matlab toolboxes are called , and measures related to specific toolboxes , such as garch models , neural networks and wavelets , are not implemented in mats . finally , further possible development of mats and improvement of its applicability are discussed . this paper presents the matlab toolkit and the measures implemented in it .<n> the basic features of the mats toolkit are presented and the implemented measures are briefly described . some representative real - world applications of the software<n> are also presented . in this paper , we have developed a new method for the analysis of time series .<n> the method is based on the idea of _ time series resampling _ , which is an improvement of the well - known _ amplitude adjusted fourier transform _ ( aaft ) algorithm @xcite . in this method ,<n> a time series @xmath0 is generated by ( a ) an independent ( white noise ) process , ( b ) a gaussian process and ( c ) the linear stochastic process . the _ standard deviation _ of the normalized time series is also taken into account . <n> time series analysis is one of the most important areas of research in statistics . when analyzing time series<n> , it is often of interest to test an hypothesis for the underlying system to the given time series and this can be carried out by generating randomized or bootstrap time series from the null hypotheses . for this purpose , a number of methods have been proposed . among these , there are : _ random permutation _<n> ( rp ) , _ uniform standardization _ and _ iterated aaf _ algorithm ( ia autocorrelation is one of the most important autoregressive ( ar ) measures and is widely used to test the robustness of gaussian processes .<n> however , it is not straightforward to generate a time series of ar measures that is consistent with the marginal distribution and approximately the original ar power spectrum . in this paper , we present a novel method of generating a new class of time series , which we call _ surrogate _ time series from a suitably designed ar process , and test the consistency of the generated time series with that of a monotonic ar transform . the algorithm of _ amplitude adjusted fourier transform _ ( aaft ) is used to generate the surrogate time series and then the rank order of @xmath0 is reordered to match the ranks of the time series generated by the iaaft algorithm . <n> the _ statically transformed autoregression process _<n> ( stap ) algorithm is used for the same h@xmath1 as for iaaaft and the surrogate data are statically transforming realizations of a suitably design arprocess . finally , _autoregressive model residual bootstrap _ is used we introduce a graphical user interface ( gui ) for generating histograms and plots of time series .<n> the user can specify a large number of parameters and then select a number of statistical measures and parameters that characterize the time series and their order in terms of correlation , frequency and autoregressive models . <n> the output is stored in a matrix and the graphical interface allows the user to zoom in and out of the plots , to compare them with other plots in the literature , and to interactively explore the underlying time series structure and their correlation structure . for time series of length @xmath0<n> the gui displays the number of underlying attractors as a function of time , i.e. , the length of the current time series set . in the case of linear time series<n> the plot displays the time dependence of the attractor s length , as well as the correlation dimension and the kolmogorov - smirnov parameter for the current measure set and the underlying linear correlation model . the user is also able to generate histograms in 2d and 3d , plot them either as superimposed lines in one panel for the given time series or as subplots in the matrix plot of given we present a set of tools for the analysis and prediction of time series , based on nonlinear correlation and mutual information measures .<n> these tools are implemented in a python code that can be used to analyze and compare time series from a wide range of different sources . <n> the _ autoregressive model _ ( ar ) is used to define the order of an ar model by the largest lag that provides significant partial autocorrelation . for the moving average ( ma ) part ,<n> the ar part is defined by @xmath0 , where the mean value is estimated by the sample average ( the quantity is standardized in the same way as for the second order correlation , i.e. , the correlation coefficient ) . the nonlinear measures include 19 measures based on the nonlinear correlation ( bicorrelation , mutual information , dimension and complexity ) and nonlinear models ( local average and local linear models ) @xcite . here<n> , all the samples are used for fitting and prediction , and the samples in the so - called test set are used to compute the statistical measure . in order to make prediction at the current step , an iterative scheme is used and one step ahead predictions in this paper , we present a new approach to the estimation of the correlation dimension for time series .<n> the measure is computed from the sample density of the distances of points from the time series reconstructed from their correlation sum , and we implement it as the mean local slope in the interval @xmath0 $ ] . <n> the estimation starts with the computation of the so - called correlation sum and the associated correlation integral , which is then used to compute the correlation measure . for the equidistant and the equiprobable estimate of mutual information ,<n> the respective specific delays are computed as well . as an example , for the bivariate correlation dimension , the estimators of the upper and lower bounds are computed for the first , second and third delays , as well as for the optimal delay for state space reconstruction , a prerequisite of nonlinear time series analysis . in the case<n> that the first delay is twice the second delay and the third delay is the same as the first one , then the upper bound of the estimation error is the variance , while the lower bound is the round - off error . the variance is computed as the square root of the square of the variance of the distance density from the we present a new method for time series analysis based on the estimation of the correlation and embedding dimensions .<n> the method is applied to synthetic and real data sets generated by the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm . in practice ,<n> the estimates of these parameters are derived from the correlation sum and the embedding dimension , respectively , and are affected by several factors , such as the length of the time series , the level of noise in the data and the round - off error . for noise - free data , a lower bound for the correlation dimension<n> is set by the average correlation sum over all inter - point distances within a certain radius , which is a measure of the similarity of the data to a random symbolic sequence . here , we introduce a new measure of similarity , namely the approximate entropy , that is a computationally simple and efficient estimate of entropy that measures the so - called  pattern similarity '' in the time - series . <n> time series are increasingly used to study a wide range of phenomena , from financial markets to climate change @xcite . the analysis of these time series<n> is usually performed by dynamical system approaches , in which the attractor of the this paper presents a novel approach for nonlinear time series analysis .<n> different measures of complexity ( approximate entropy , kolmogorov complexity , largest lyapunov exponent , local state space models , @xmath0-@xmath1 tree data structure ) are implemented . <n> time series are generated from a monte carlo simulation of a simple hamiltonian system , and are fitted and predicted using a local linear model ( local average model ) , a local nonlinear model and two different models with non - linear couplings . in order to estimate the complexity of the models and the coupling coefficients , three different types of local models<n> are implemented and they are specified by the value of the so - called truncation parameter . the approximate entropy and the algorithmic complexity<n> are computed by using the nearest - neighbor mappings of the neighboring points in the space formed by the points , which are assigned equidistant and equiprobable bins , respectively . for each model ,<n> the estimated complexity is expressed as the logarithm of the ratio of two correlation sums computed for the allocated bins . *<n> pacs : * 05.45.+b , 02.50.ey , we present a novel approach to the fit and prediction of complex time series .<n> the method is based on least squares estimation of local linear models and principal component regression regularization of the local model parameters . for multi - step fit or prediction , both the direct and iterative schemes<n> are implemented . <n> we apply the method to real - world oscillating time series from neuroscience and compare the results with those obtained with the standard methods , namely mape , nmse , nrmse and cc . in many applications , such as neuroscience , finance , medicine and engineering , it is necessary to predict and fit complex data<n> . however , fitting and fitting to time series is a complex task . to do so<n> , there is a need for efficient and accurate numerical methods to fit and predict the data , especially in the presence of noise . here<n> we present an approach for the solution of the problem , which is simple , efficient , accurate , robust to noise , and applicable to a wide range of data sets , including real world oscillating data . * keywords : * autoregressive model , detrended fluctuation analysis , hjorth parameters , the matlab toolbox for time series analysis ( mats toolkit ) consists of two modules , one for handling time series and one for measure calculation .<n> the user interface consists of several components that are integrated in the first module and they access and update a commonly shared data base , which is communicated to the end user through the current time series list . this data base is globally declared in the main gui and is directly and effectively accessed by the gui components , meaning that files of configurations of selected measures in special format can also be imported . in the second module , the user<n> is able to start the computation of the selected measures on all the time series , to segment and to resample time series or to delete time series from the list and sort the displayed time series with respect to name and size . <n> time series processing , oscillating features , feature statistics the matlab framework is a graphical user interface ( gui ) environment for plotting and analyzing experimental time series .<n> the gui components are organized in groups and subgroups according to the outcome of the selected measures on the ensemble of time series and to the names of the time series in the measured time series list . in particular , the user can select one or more of the local fit and prediction measures ( making use of the direct or iterative scheme ) , resample , truncate , delete and sort time series from the list , view plots of measures vs resampled indices , edit and print results , and more . <n> time series are represented in a data base ; they are computed using standard matlab functions and the output is visualized in a variety of formats , such as tables , plots , images , animations , etc . the measures and parameters on the data base for different time series<n> are stored in a second data base that is accessible from the gui ; these two data bases can be used for plotting or exporting time series for different applications , e.g. , for reanalysis , prediction , or reconstruction . a facility of mats is a set of matlab mats ( measures vs parameters analysis tool ) toolkit is presented .<n> mats is a set of graphical user interfaces ( guis ) that can be used in various applications of time series analysis such as , detection of regime change in long data records , surrogate data test for nonlinearity , discrimination ability of different measures , assessment of the dependence of a measure on its parameters , feature - based clustering of measure data , and finally plotting of measures vs segment indices . <n> the main motivation for the development of mats toolkit is to facilitate the analysis of long eeg records and in particular to allow for the detection of changes in the eeg signals that may presignify an impending event , such as seizure . in mats ,<n> the user is able to easily specify and specify the different visualization facilities and to select measures from the current measure list and time series names from the measured time series list . for each visualization facility<n> , the user can also select a parameter from the list of all parameters and mark the measures of interest ( for example , measures that do not include the key character for the selected parameter ) . finally , plots of measure vs parameter ( 2d plot ) and measure vs two parameters we propose a new approach to time series analysis called segmented measure analysis ( mats ) .<n> mats is based on the idea that time series data can be segmented into segments and measure data from each segment can be computed on consecutive segments . in mats<n> , each segment of the time series can be viewed as a set of @xmath0 discrete time series , with each segment containing a measure profile for each segment . <n> mats can be applied to any simulated or real world time series and is therefore a powerful tool for the analysis of pre - ictal and complex data . as an example , we will show how mats is used to analyze long epileptic human encephalograms ( eeg ) and how it can be used to detect changes in the amplitude of the eeg signals that may indicate impending seizure onset , as well as to characterize various brain activities like sleep , sleep phases , and , more generally , any time series that is generated from a facility view time series<n> . the concept of segmented time series ( rts ) has been around for more than a century @xcite and has found numerous applications in a variety of fields , such as signal processing , signal processing on we present a novel surrogate data analysis technique for the analysis of eeg recordings from healthy young adults undergoingepileptic seizures ( eegs ) .<n> the proposed approach is based on the use of a large set of nonlinear measures that are segmented into energy bands , local and global minima , as well as the statistics of the oscillating features . using this approach ,<n> surrogate data can be generated for the null hypothesis that the eeg signal is the result of a linear stochastic process , i.e. , aaft , iaaf , and three different algorithms that generate surrogate data for the linear process are evaluated . <n> epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that manifests itself in different stages in the life - cycle of the patient , ranging from pre - ictal to epileptic seizures @xcite . in the first part of this paper , we present an analysis of surrogate data generated for a healthy @xmath0@xmath1 young adult ( yba ) during its first seizure , prior to seizure onset , using a state - of - the - art surrogate data processing ( sdp ) technique . the surrogate data<n> is then used to generate time series of e * background : * a number of neurological disorders such as epilepsy , alzheimer s disease , and post - ictal seizures have been studied extensively in the literature . however , little is known about the statistical properties of eeg time series in these disorders .<n> + * methods * : we introduce a novel approach to analyze eeg data based on nonlinear measures . <n> * results : _ we show that nonlinear measures provide a useful tool for the analysis of the time series data , as they allow us to identify the presence of nonlinear dynamics in the original time series and thus to reject the null hypothesis of no nonlinearity in the data . using this tool<n> , we investigate the dynamics of autocorrelation and pearson autocorrelation in the eeg profiles of @xmath0 patients with type ii epileptic seizures . + _<n> conclusions :<n> _ nonlinear correlations are observed in the profiles of the autocorrelations for all the patients studied , indicating that nonlinearity is present in the underlying dynamics of these diseases . as a result ,<n> we find that there are two distinct states of epilepsy : a late pre - icstal state ( prior to seizure onset ) we present an algorithm for surrogate data analysis on eeg time series at ictal and pre - ic tal states .<n> the algorithm is based on the _ autocorrelation at seizure _ ( aaft ) , which discriminates between nonlinear and linear measures on the time series , and provides the original mutual information value only for the eeg . <n> the data is resampled in a way such that the linear autocorrelation of the nonlinear time series is preserved and the discrimination between the nonlinear and the linear measures is verified at the same level of confidence as for the surrogate data . in order to validate the algorithm , we have performed a number of tests on the data and compared the results with those obtained from the parametric and nonparametric approaches . *<n> introduction : * the problem of data analysis in the presence of autocorrelation is not only of theoretical and practical interest , but also arises in a wide range of applications , e.g. , in finance , medicine , biology , engineering , social sciences , information technology , robotics , etc . the problem is that the number of time series to be analyzed increases exponentially with the volume of the data , so that matlab is an interactive matlab toolkit for analysis of scalar time series .<n> the strength of mats is that it can process many time series in one go , which are loaded directly from files or generated using the facilities of segmentation , standardization and resampling . in addition , some effort was made on effective computation , but it is in the intention of the authors to implement a faster @xmath0-@xmath1 tree structure and more efficient calculation of the correlation dimension . running on matlab<n> , mats uses all fine matlab tools and especially the interactive graphic user interface ( gui ) for the selection of the various operations , such as the choice of measures and their parameters , and for visualizing time series and measures in a number of different graph types . <n> _ keywords _ : matlab , surrogate data test , nonlinear time series analysis , pearson autocorrelation , eeg , seizure this paper describes a matlab application for the analysis of time series data .<n> the application can be used for various types of analysis requiring minimum user interface . by selecting buttons , checking boxes and specifying parameter values , the user can perform rather complicated tasks . two such tasks are demonstrated step by step , namely the computation of many measures on consecutive segments of a long time series , and the surrogate data test for nonlinearity on different time series and using different surrogate generating algorithms and test statistics . <n> time series analysis is a very active field of research nowadays , both from a theoretical and a practical point of view . in the field of data analysis ,<n> a lot of tools and techniques have been developed in the last years , e.g. , markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods @xcite , matrix product states ( mps ) @xmath0 relaxation time approximation method ( rdam ) , nonlinear functional analysis ( nla ) and others . among these tools , a number of them have found their way into the real world in the form of matlab applications . for example , in this paper we describe an application called _",

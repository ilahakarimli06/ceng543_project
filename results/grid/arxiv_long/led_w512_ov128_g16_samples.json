      "generated": "ly , there has been a wide interest in relativistic potentials involving mixtures of vector and scalar potentials with opposite signs .     the interest lies on attempts to explain the pseudospin symmetry in nuclear physics .    in the case @xcite , using a dirac hamiltonian with scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath2 potentials quadratic in space coordinates , found a harmonic - oscillator - like second order equation which can be solved analytically for @xmath3 , as considered before by kukulin _  , ginocchio and bell and ruegg @xcite , and also for @xmath4 .    in the case @xmath4 , ginocchio solved the triaxial , axial , and spherical harmonic oscillators for the case @xmath5 and applied it to the study of antinucleons embedded in nuclei @xcite .     the case @xmath6 is particularly relevant in nuclear physics , since it is usually pointed out as a necessary condition for occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in nuclei @xcite-@xcite . also the observed isospin dependence of pseudospin the research of this kind of interaction was started by it @xcite and has been revived by moshinsky and szczepaniak @xcite ( see @xcite for a complete reference list ) .    in ref . and without the tensor interaction . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ again , the charge conjugation connects this problem with the ho for nucleons with pseudospin symmetry ( @xmath13 ) , but in this case the positive harmonic binding potential is @xmath14 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note that , because the harmonic potential does not vanish for large distances but is a confining potential , it is possible to obtain particle bound - state solutions in the exact pseudospin limit @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we believe that this connection between spin and pseudospin symmetry obtained by charge conjugation deserves to be more explored . in addition , after the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed as a relativistic symmetry by ginocchio @xcite , a link of it to chiral symmetry has been suggested based on sum rules calculations in relativistic chiral models that support a small value for @xmath8 @xcite . however , until now , a clear connection of pseudospin and chiral symmetries has not been established . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the main motivation of this paper is to shed some light in the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 chiral transformations . in order to do to have exact spin and pseudospin symmetry in 3 + 1 dimensions . � we explore all the possible signs of the quadratic ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) and linear ( pseudoscalar ) potentials , thus paying attention to bound states of fermions and antifermions as well . � we compare both cases @xmath9 and @xmath6 to establish the charge - conjugation connection discussed above in the presence of the pseudoscalar term . � we also consider the case of zero mass to look for the connection between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of the chiral transformation . � an added motivation for this paper is given by the recent demonstration that the relativistic 3 + 1 ho with scalar and vector potentials can describe successfully the heavy nucleus spectrum @xcite . � the parameters of the ho are determined by fitting the scalar and vector potentials derived from relativistic mean field nuclear calculations ( rmf ) . � the @xmath17pb neutron single - particle levels obtained in the ho are very similar to the rmf results . � the pseudospin symmetry is shown to be almost satisfied for a heavy nucleus in the existence of antinucleons in nuclei and their spectrum . and @xmath6 cases are discussed in sec .  [ sec : nonrelativistic limit ] [ subsec : nonrel_limit ] , where we show that when @xmath6 there is no nonrelativistic limit when the pseudoscalar potential vanishes or is very small . in sec .  [ sec : rel_h_oscillator ] we introduce the general relativistic harmonic oscillator in 1 + 1 dimensions for @xmath9 by assigning a quadratic potential @xmath20 for @xmath8 and a linear potential @xmath21 for the pseudoscalar potential @xmath22 .  [ sec : relativistic_limit ] , where we present the eigenvalue equation and the wave functions for bound states , discuss the dirac oscillator case ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and show how one can use the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations to get the eigenenergies for the @xmath6 case from the @xmath9 case .  [ sec : relativistic_limit ] , where the following section is devoted to a detailed analysis of the solutions of the @xmath9 relativistic harmonic oscillator rices @xcite � . then , there results that the scalar and vector interactions preserve their lorentz structures whereas the anomalous magnetic - like interaction turns out to be a pseudoscalar interaction . � furthermore , in the 1 + 1 world there is no angular momentum so that the spin is absent . � therefore , the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation allows us to explore the physical consequences of the negative - energy states in a mathematically simpler and more physically transparent way . in this spirit � the two - dimensional version of the anomalous magnetic - like interaction linear in the space coordinate has also received attention @xcite-@xcite . � later this system was shown to be a particular case of a more general class of exactly solvable problems asc2 . � let us begin by presenting the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions . � the dirac equation for a particle with mass @xmath30 and a general potential @xmath31 , to be defined later , is formally the same as its 3 + 1 counterpart : @xmath32here @xmath33 and the @xmath34 matrices @xmath35 obey the usual relations @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and obey the relations @xmath47 , @xmath48 . change sign under a parity transformation , whereas @xmath37 and @xmath59 , which commute with @xmath73 , remain the same . xmath15 into @xmath95 . ㅋ therefore , to be invariant under charge conjugation , the hamiltonian must contain only a scalar potential . ㅋ the chiral operator for a dirac spinor is the matrix @xmath0 , and we will call `` chiral transformation '' the transformation associated with it . ㅋ thus , the transformed spinor is given by @xmath96 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath97 . ㅋ since @xmath98 anticommutes with @xmath59 , the time - independent chiral - transformed dirac equation is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 or @xmath102 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath14 . ㅋ this means that the chiral transformation changes the sign of the mass and of the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials , thus turning @xmath8 into @xmath14 and vice - versa . ㅋ a chiral - invariant hamiltonian needs to have zero mass and @xmath103 and @xmath22 zero everywhere . ㅋ the space component of the 2-vector potential in ( [ def_v ] ) can be absorbed into the respect to @xmath27 . in terms of @xmath109 and @xmath110 the spinor is normalized as @xmath109 , so that @xmath109 and @xmath110 are square integrable functions . 127 \\psi_{+ } = \\frac{e^{2}-m^{2}c^{4}}{2mc^{2}}\\psi_{+}\\ , \\label{2_order_delta=0_psi+}\\ ] ] and for @xmath11 with @xmath128 , ( [ psi+_gen ] ) and ( [ 2_order_gen_psi- ] ) reduce to @xmath129 @xmath130 \\psi_{- } = \\frac{e^{2}-m^{2}c^{4}}{2mc^{2}}\\psi_{-}\\ . \\label{2_order_sigma=0_psi-}\\ ] ] either for @xmath5 with @xmath125 or @xmath11 with @xmath131 the solution of the relativistic problem is mapped into a sturm - liouville problem in such a way that solution can be found by solving a schrdinger - like problem . if one considers potentials @xmath91 and @xmath1 quadratic in @xmath27 with @xmath132 and a potential @xmath93 linear in @xmath27 one ob \\frac{i}{% \\hbar c}\\left ( \\sigma + 2mc^{2}\\right ) \\psi_{+}% \\end{array } \\right\\ } , \\mathrm{\\;for\\;}\\delta = 0\\mathrm{\\;with\\;}e = mc^{2 } \\label{isol_sol_delta=0}\\ ] ] and @xmath136 \\\\ \\\\ � \\displaystyle\\psi_{+ } ^{\\prime } -\\frac{v_{p}}{\\hbar c}\\,\\psi_{+ } = -\\frac{i}{% \\hbar c}\\left ( \\delta -2mc^{2}\\right ) \\psi_{-}% \\end{array } \\right\\ } , \\mathrm{\\;for\\;}\\sigma = 0\\mathrm{\\;with\\;}e = mc^{2 } \\label{isol_sol_sigma=0}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath140 are normalization constants . � since , by parity conservation , @xmath22 must be an odd function of @xmath139 , its integral must be an even function of @ or components has to be zero , either @xmath118 in the first case ( sign of the @xmath22 coefficient positive ) or @xmath115 in the last case ( sign of the @xmath22 coefficient negative ) . relativistic limit in the special cases @xmath151 and @xmath6 , which we will also consider later in the paper when we solve the dirac equation for harmonic oscillator potentials .    this is in agreement with what was found in ref , namely that when @xmath9 , eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq_mot_nr2a ] ) becomes @xmath152    here we clearly see that @xmath8 plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit and that @xmath22 gives rise to effective binding potentials proportional to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .     this means that even a pseudoscalar potential unbounded from below could be a confining potential .     this is in agreement with what was found in ref , namely that when @xmath155 is of the same order that @xmath156 in a @xmath157 expansion within the classically accessible region ( positive kinetic energy ) where the wave function is not negligible , and if its variation over this region is such that @xmath158 ( @xmath22 changes very little over a distance of the order of a compton wavelength ) , @ math14 is a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential , there is no nonrelativistic limit . in this case \u001c we were able to show that this is true in a more general framework . a model for a relativistic particle in which the vector and scalar potentials are such that @xmath6 , and where the pseudoscalar potential is suppressed , is intrinsically relativistic , as far as bound states are concerned .  embodiments this last result deserves some more comments .  embodiments the fact that in a dirac equation one can have lorentz scalar and pseudoscalar potentials leads to remarkable results that are at odds with what is known from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , where the lorentz structure plays no role , since one has only potentials which couple to the energy , _ \u001c i.e. _ , behave as time components of a relativistic vector . among these results  embodiments this last result deserves some more comments .  embodiments the fact that the dirac equation is not invariant under a simultaneous shift of the energy , the scalar potential , and the pseudoscalar potential .  embodiments it has already been verified that a constant added to the pseudoscalar potential relativistic binding potentials may not bind in the nonrelativistic limit .      this is the case of @xmath164 ( @xmath11 ) referred before , and is basically due to the fact that vector potentials couple in a different way than scalar potentials in the dirac equation , whereas there is no such distinction in the schrdinger equation . actually , as we have seen before , @xmath8 , which is the sum of a vector and a scalar potential , plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit , whereas a weak enough @xmath14 can not bind a fermion with nonrelativistic energy if @xmath6 . math171 and @xmath172 .                                                                                           this symmetry can be clearly seen from the two equation pairs ( [ psi-_gen])-([2_order_gen_psi+ ] ) and ( [ psi+_gen])-([2_order_gen_psi- ] ) as well as from the isolated solutions ( [ isol_sol_delta=0 ] ) and ( [ isol_sol_sigma=0 ] ) which are converted into each other by this kind of transformation . - known solution of the schrdinger equation for the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator ( see , _ ) we can get the quantization condition for the dirac eigenenergies : @xmath194 the nonrelativistic limit is reached when @xmath195 and @xmath196 . in this case \u001c @xmath197 for small quantum numbers , and eq . escription ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) becomes @xmath198 so that @xmath199 is restricted to @xmath200 . escription in general there is no requirements on the signs of @xmath199 and @xmath201 , except that , as stated before , @xmath202 , and therefore , from ( [ def_k ] ) , the dirac eigenenergies corresponding to the bound - state solutions must be within the limits @xmath203 for @xmath204 , when there is a pure pseudoscalar potential linear in @xmath27 ( the two - dimensional dirac oscillator ) , eq . escription ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) reduces to @xmath205\\ . \\label{energy_eigen_k1=0}\\ ] ] note that @xmath206 for @xmath207 and @xmath208 for @x math192 and @xmath207 , respectively ( see eqs . escription ( isol_sol_delta=0 ) and ( [ isol_sol_sigma=0 ] ) ) . however , the spinors do depend on the sign of @xmath26 , because different signs induce different node structures , as can be seen from ( [ psi-_delta=0_k1=0 ] ) . escription since the charge - conjugation transformation changes the sign of @xmath26 , it connects both kinds of solutions , but each can have both positive and negative energies . escription thus a complete set of states for a certain @xmath26 includes both particle ( positive energy ) and antiparticle ( negative energy ) states but they are not related to each other by a charge - conjugation transformation . escription the spectral gap between these solutions is @xmath213 and does not disappear when @xmath214 . escription therefore , there is no room for transitions from positive- to negative - energy solutions and klein s paradox never comes into play . escription there are no scattering states when @xmath204 , but for @xmath215 the continuum states are those ones which have energies beyond the limits expressed by ( there is no isolated bounded solutions and the quantization condition expressed by eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) takes the form @xmath218 where @xmath219 stands for the sign function . upper and lower components , so that the second - order equation to solve in this case is the one for the lower component , eq . � ( [ 2_order_sigma=0_psi- ] ) . the upper component would be obtained from the corresponding first - order equation eq . � ( [ psi+_sigma=0 ] ) . as a final remark � , one may note that for massless particles , the @xmath5 and @xmath234 oscillators have the same spectrum with the sign of @xmath201 reversed .    in 3 + 1 dimensions the corresponding eigenvalue equations to eqs . � ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ) and ( [ eigen_eq_sigma=0 ] ) have a very similar structure .    in 3 + 1 dimensions we see that , for @xmath9 , one just adds the dirac equation quantum number @xmath19 to the coefficient of @xmath26 and modifies the coefficient of the square root to include the orbital angular momentum @xmath235 of the upper component @xmath236 while for @xmath6 one uses the orbital angular momentum @xmath237 of the lower component and @xmath201 one has to seek a convenient method for solving this transcendental equation . if we square eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) the resulting equation is in general a quartic algebraic equation in @xmath57 , which in principle can be solved analytically . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the price paid is that some spurious roots can appear in this process , although , of course , these can be eliminated by checking whether they satisfy the original equation . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a more instructive procedure is follow a graphical method , by which one seeks the intersection points of the functions of energy in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) : a parabola on the left - hand side @xmath240 and a square - root function on the right - hand side @xmath241 in this way , it is easy to see that there are at most two acceptable solutions of ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) , since the parabola and the square - root function can have at most two intersection points . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the construction of the graph of @xmath242 is split into three distinct classes depending on the @xmath199 values . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ general properties of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 transformations which hold in 3 + 1 dimensions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ although we have already solved this case , it is presented here for the sake of completeness . for @xmath204 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , @xmath242 is just a nonnegative constant function as can be seen from eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ energy_eigen_k1=0 ] ) , having two symmetric intersections with the parabola . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig1 ] and fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the first shows how the values of the energy are obtained from the intersection of the two curves and the second how the eigenvalues vary with @xmath26 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the energies for the zero mass case can also be computed from the intersections with the dashed parabola in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig1 ] and fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @x @xmath253 . furthermore , the positive and negative solutions are such that @xmath265 , since , when @xmath266 and @xmath26 negative there is a solution with @xmath267 , but this is an isolated solution out of the sturm - liouville problem we are considering .    the considerations of the previous paragraph can be further elaborated by analyzing the behavior of the function @xmath268 @xmath269 according to what was stated in the previous paragraph , if @xmath270 one has two solutions for each @xmath183 , and if @xmath271 there is just one solution for each @xmath183 . to determine the signs of @xmath268 for each value of @xmath26 , we will need to know the values of @xmath26 which are roots of @xmath272 , or of the equation @xmath273 excluding the solution @xmath274 . applying descartes rule of signs to this last equation , we see that it can only have a positive real solution .     the rule states that the number of positive real roots @xmath275 of an algebraic equation with real coefficients @xmath276 is never greater than the number of changes of signs @xmath277 in according to what we have said before , there is only one positive - energy solution when @xmath284 and two solutions ( one positive and one negative ) when @xmath192 or @xmath285 . if @xmath274 , the two functions intersect at @xmath286 , but again , since this solution was excluded from the sturm - liouville problem leading to the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) , we consider only the harmonic oscillator solutions with energy greater than @xmath284 and three values of @xmath288 and three values of @xmath253 . It is important to note these features , as can be seen from the plots of @xmath259 when @xmath26 is negative .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and [ fig4 ] it is clearly seen that for values of @xmath26 between zero and @xmath302 there are only positive - energy solutions .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and [ fig4 ] it is clearly seen that for values of @xmath26 between zero and @xmath302 there are only positive - energy solutions .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and moreover , one can see from eq .  ( [ fs_min = fp_min ] ) that the value of @xmath302 increases with @xmath25 , meaning that when @xmath303 one reaches the limit of the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath304 ) where there are only positive bound - state solutions with @xmath305 .    [ fig4 ] and thus , the existence of the pseudoscalar potential gives rise to negative - energy solutions coming from the dirac sea .    [ fig4 ] and thus , for @xmath306 these kind of solutions always s .     ( [ psi+_delta=0_oh ] ) and ( [ psi-_delta=0_oh ] ) ) . for @xmath311      the degeneracy is removed and we have a very high density of very delocalized states ( since @xmath312 ) which then decreases with increasing @xmath313 . in fig .      [ fig4 ] we also plotted the parabola @xmath314 ( in scaled units @xmath315 ) which corresponds to the asymptotic values of the negative - energy states when @xmath316 and thus represents the set of lower energy bounds of the negative - energy solutions for each pair of @xmath25 and @xmath26 values . the negative - energy states are continuum states .     as a function of @xmath253 .     as a function of @xmath26 . discussed in the previous section . � however , when @xmath224 , one can solve eq . � ( [ isol_sol_delta=0 ] ) when @xmath133 and obtain a bound - state solution with both upper and lower components different from zero , if and only if @xmath332 . � one can show that this corresponds to a @xmath289 solution given by the functions ( psi+_delta=0_oh ) and ( [ psi-_delta=0_oh ] ) taking the limit @xmath333 . � in addition to that set of solutions , there can be another set of solutions only if the function @xmath334 ( see eq . � [ def_f(k2 ) ] ) is zero or positive , as explained before . to determine the values of @xmath201 for which this happens � , one has to compute the roots @xmath335 of @xmath336 . � when @xmath224 , descartes rule of signs applied to @xmath336 states that one can have a positive root and two or zero negative roots ( this is done by changing @xmath337 in ( [ descartes_rule ] ) ) math347 , this means that when @xmath343 there is only one range of values of @xmath201 where @xmath348 whereas when @xmath349 there are two ranges of @xmath201 values where this happens . within these ranges , � only negative - energy solutions exist . � when @xmath350 , the value @xmath351 corresponds to an infinite set of degenerate negative - energy solutions with scaled energy @xmath352 , which , as mentioned before , are not bound - state solutions . � these features of the spectrum can be seen in figs . � [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .      as a function of @xmath253 . as in fig . � fig4 the three non - zero values of the roots of @xmath268 , @xmath353 , are marked with a cross in the energy axis . � as in that figure , the hollow circles mark the point ( @xmath354 , @xmath322 ) and the three points where ( @xmath282 , @xmath355 ) . � the dashed parabola represents the function @xmath356 ( see text).,width=377 ]     as the value of @xmath178 is zero , these are very weakly bounded solutions . is governed by the sign of the function @xmath369 identical with @xmath268 , except that now @xmath26 acts as a parameter and @xmath25 is the variable .     as before , the critical value is now @xmath370 . in fig .    as before , in fig7 we present a plot of the solutions for @xmath207 , when there are two possible values for @xmath371 , the roots of @xmath372 .     as before , we note that when we take apart the factor @xmath373 , this is just a quadratic equation in @xmath25 , so that it is easily shown that when @xmath374 it has no real solutions .     as before , this means that , since in this case @xmath375 , there are always two sets of solutions . note that now the points in the energy-@xmath25 plane for which @xmath376 are on the hyperbole @xmath377 , such that only in the region between the hyperbole branches , where @xmath178 is positive , bound states may exist .     as a function of @xmath378 .    as before ymptote of the hyperbole branches which separate the continuum region from the bound - state region . � as referred before , the case @xmath6 can be obtained from the @xmath9 case by applying the charge - conjugation transformation . � we recall that this transformation performs the changes @xmath384 , @xmath385 and @xmath386 , or , for harmonic oscillator potentials , the changes @xmath387 and @xmath388 . � this can be seen if we solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath6 , eq .  ( [ eigen_eq_sigma=0 ] ) , for @xmath389 and plot the solutions for several values of @xmath362 . � the result is shown in fig .  [ fig8 ] .      as a function of @xmath253 and @xmath6 . � the conventions are the same as in fig .  [ fig8 ] .     as a function of @xmath253 and @xmath6 . � the dashed parabola represents now the function @xmath390 . � @xmath391 stands for the quantum number of the solutions of eq . In the thorac equation of relativistic nuclear mean - field theories there is a connection between the ( isoscalar ) vector and tensor potential . � the latter is proportional to the derivative of the former @xcite . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , this would give , using the notation of ref . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , this would give , using the notation of ref . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , there should be also an upper value for @xcite , the relation @xmath393the constant @xmath394 can take values up to around 1.3 in nuclei using relativistic mean - field potentials of woods - saxon type @xcite . for harmonic oscillator mean - field potentials , there should be also an upper value for @xmath395 , and therefore the relation ( [ k_2_k_1_f_v ] ) sets a maximum for @xmath396 in nuclei . � as was seen above , this is relevant to know whether there can be simultaneously nucleon and antinucleon bound states in nuclei . � this would depend very sec : rel_h_oscillator ] we have seen that the @xmath0 chiral transformation can also be used to get formally @xmath6 from @xmath151 solutions , involving , however , the unphysical transformation @xmath400 . � this objection is overcome when we deal with ultrarelativistic particles , for which we may consider @xmath401 . in this case � [ sec : rel_h_oscillator ] , the chiral transformation relates massless physical states with @xmath402 and a pseudoscalar potential @xmath22 to massless states with @xmath403 and @xmath404 , where @xmath405 can be an arbitrary potential . for harmonic oscillator potentials , one has @xmath406 and @xmath388 . � [ sec : rel_h_oscillator ] , the chiral transformation does not change the equations of motion , the energy of their solutions is not changed . � this can be seen in figs . � [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , where are plotted , respectively , the solutions of the @xmath9 and @xmath407 eigenvalue equations , eqs . � ( [ as a function of @xmath253 for @xmath6 and @xmath251 .    we see that the conventions are the same as in fig .    we see that the dashed parabola represents the function @xmath409.,width=377 ]    we see that the spectra are the same apart from the @xmath388 change , which shows up as a reversal of the horizontal axis . for @xmath274 , the pure harmonic oscillator solution , both spectra are _ identical    we see that the energy eigenstates _ are _ identical     we see that the energy eigenstates _ are not the same _ , with no negative -

state solutions in the nonrelativistic limit for @xmath11 and @xmath22 very small , meaning in this case we have an intrinsic relativistic problem . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we analyzed in great detail , by use of a graphical procedure , the solutions of the transcendental eigenvalue equation in the case of @xmath9 , for all signs of the potentials and for both particle and antiparticle states . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ as referred in the introduction , there is an increasing interest in studying the behavior of antinucleon in nuclei , and in particular how well pseudospin and spin symmetries hold for nucleons and antinucleons respectively . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we discussed in detail the isolated solutions , _ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ i.e. _ , solutions out of the sturm - liouville problem , as well as the critical points in the parameter space of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the coefficients of the quadratic and linear potentials . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ also , we showed that there is a high density of bounded states which are very the solutions for @xmath6 from the @xmath9 case , using the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations .     in particular , we used the chiral transformation to show that , for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , the @xmath5 and @xmath11 solutions have the same spectrum .     these conclusions are quite general and do not depend on the number of dimensions so that they remain true in 3 + 1 dimensions .     also , most of the features of the 1 + 1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3 + 1 relativistic harmonic oscillator . indeed , since the 1 + 1 eigenvalue equations for @xmath9 and @xmath6 are very similar to the corresponding 3 + 1 equations , we can apply the same graphical methods to the 3 + 1 case , and therefore most of the analysis of the 1 + 1 case remains true with appropriate changes .     for instance , the shape of the parabola in the energy-@xmath26 plane related to @xmath413 would depend now on the value of the spin -

[ fig1a]a is no longer valid .    [ fig1a]a propagators are then fixed by the inverse of the matrix which appears in the quadratic part of the lagrangian .    a direct calculation then furnishes    @xmath33 propagator :    @xmath162    where    @xmath163(ap^2+b\\tilde{p}^2 ) } + \\frac{bp^2}{p^2 a(ap^2+b\\tilde{p}^2)}.\\ ] ]    mixed propagator :    @xmath164    where    @xmath165    @xmath166    at small momenta @xmath167 and @xmath168 in both situations discriminated above and @xmath169 for the case 1 . thus , the transversal part of the @xmath33 field propagator diverges badly ( as @xmath170 ) at small momentum . in a local model such behavior     would in a nonrelativistic limit be associated with a potential which grows linearly with the distance from a charge probe .    therefore the quanta of the @xmath2 field would be confined graphs on the figs .    in the diagrams [ fig2 ] and [ fig2a ] ( we may have other diagrams containing the mixed propagator but these are nonplanar diagrams without ir or uv divergences ) . of fig .    [ fig2a]b would have also a nonplanar part which asymptotically is similar to ( [ 11 ] ) .    in the present situation , however , the numerical factors do not match and no cancellation could take place .     in this work we focused on the construction of a consistent extension of the @xmath0 model to the noncommutative space . as we have seen , there are various possible extensions which depend on the way the fields transform under the gauge group . in all situations ,    we have chosen the auxiliary field @xmath14 as belonging to the adjoint representation . for the @xmath2 field belonging to the fundamental representation this prescription automatically prevents the appearance of a mixed @xmath38 propagator .    in all situations ,    we have chosen the auxiliary field @xmath14 as belonging to the adjoint representation .    in all situations ,    the @xmath2 field belonging to the fundamental representation this prescription automatically prevents the appearance of a mixed @xmath38 propagator .    in fact the possibility envisaged in eq .    in fact the possibility envisaged in eq . the left representation of the gauge group .     we also proved that the ultraviolet divergences may be absorbed into counterterms which preserve the form of the original lagrangian .     therefore gauge invariance is maintained but this occurs in a way different from the commutative case .     in the commutative setting , indeed , in the commutative setting all the counterterms coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath176 and @xmath119 defined in ( [ count ] ) are equal and the @xmath33 field is not renormalized . in the present situation , however , the @xmath33 field gets renormalized and , although innocuous , a quadrilinear vertex @xmath177 counterterm occurs .     in the commutative setting , an entirely different picture is found if the basic field belongs to the adjoint representation . v mixing suggests that to achieve consistency further extensions of the model should be investigated . � this issue is the object of our next study where the inclusion of fermionic matter fields will be investigated . � this work was partially supported by fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) and conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) . � in this appendix we shall demonstrate some results concerning the ultraviolet behavior of the noncommutative @xmath0 model when the basic @xmath2 field belongs to the left fundamental representation of the gauge group . � they are :    \\a . � the subleading contributions to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 propagators , which are explicit in ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) are irrelevant as far as the ultraviolet divergences are concerned . � in fact , the only case that requires special attention is the ultraviolet behavior of the noncommutative @xmath0 model when the basic @xmath2 field which becomes at most linearly divergent if the subleading contribution for the auxiliary finally we will exemplify how the complete cancellation of ultraviolet divergences takes place in the case where several ( sub ) diagrams are involved , as in the three - loops diagram @xmath178 of fig . of the graphical identity in fig . @@@@@@@@ [ fig1a]a , @xmath196 and that @xmath197 trivial four vertex , we see that when adding the above contributions all the subtraction terms cancel . @@@@@@@@ we stress that the cancellation occurs for all subtractions including those associated to the last subtraction for the linearly divergent diagram @xmath180 ( in this case , to the reduced vertex associated to the contraction of @xmath180 to a point it is assigned a linear polynomial in the external momenta of @xmath180 ) . @@@@@@@@ this proves that the sum of the unsubtracted diagrams is finite .    if the charge flow in the upper and lower loops of fig . @@@@@@@@ [ fig5 ] are in opposite directions the corresponding diagrams are nonplanar @@@@@@@@ . they still have the same phase factor but it depends on the loop momentum of the @xmath180 diagram . @@@@@@@@ they present a linear infrared divergence which nonetheless is cancelled whenever they are added . @@@@@@@@ this is most easily seen by factorizing the noncommutative phases and then taylor expanding the remaining of the @xmath180 s integrand up to first order in the independent external momenta of that graph . . girotti , `` noncommutative quantum field theories '' , hep - th/0301237 . ߟ b521 , 119 ( 2001 ) ; h. o. girotti , m. gomes , a. yu . ߟ b521 , 119 ( 2001 ) ; h. o. girotti , m. gomes , v. o. rivelles and a. j. da silva , phys . ߟ b521 , 119 ( 2001 ) ; h. ߟ b521 , 119 ( 2001 ) ; h. o. girotti , m. gomes , v. o. rivelles and a. j. da silva , int . j. mod . ߟ b17 , 1503 ( 2002 ) . ߟ b17 , 1503 ( 2002 ) ; h. ߟ b17 , 1503 ( 2002 ) ; r. kberle and v. kurak , phys rev . lett . * ߟ b * 58 * , 627 ( 1987 ) ; phys . ߟ b * 36 * , 627 ( 1987);e . ߟ abdalla , m. c.

      "generated": "is the orbit of a photon that is affected by the field of a binary system ? this is a three- body problem with gravitational interactions . adding one body to the famous two- body problem of a photon in a gravitational field brings a remarkable complexity to the problem .    it is however believed that in a complete treatment of such motions and with todays highly accurate astronomical observations in hand , these effects must be taken into account .    this subject has been a field of interest since the astrometric space mission like gaia planned to position the stars and celestial objects with one microarcsecond level of accuracy @xcite . at this level    in this work , many subtle effects are potentially observable .    in this work , one of them would probably be the deflection of light by the field of a binary system .    in this work , when a photon moves in the ( weak gravity ) field of an isolated spherical body , the leading order corrections to the photon ( newtonian path ) are scaled by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the closest distance to the gravitating body the photon can reach and @xmath4 is the mass of such body . considering the scales characterizing our problem , it approximation .    the latter assumption permits an approximate solution to our problem by reducing the three - body problem to the motion of a photon in an effective field of the orbiting bodies .    to better discuss the dynamics of this system , we introduce two lengthscales .    in this paper , one scale is given by @xmath5 , and the other scale is the radius of the circular orbit , denoted by @xmath6 .    in this paper , we let @xmath7 be the separation between the photon and the black hole .     in this paper ,    we assume that i ) @xmath8 is small and ii ) the second body in the binary is remote . in a reference frame that moves with the main body ,    the effects of the second body on the geometry of the spacetime can be described by tidal potentials .     these are given by a linear perturbation about the schwarzchild solution ; so that the perturbed metric satisfies the vacuum field equations , perturbatively .    in this paper ,    it is straightforward to apply tidal effects to a system comprising a photon and a gravitating body , but solving the calculated in a paper by taylor and poisson @xcite . in their work ,  they used a metric given by taylor and poisson to find the _ dynamics of a black hole .    in their work ,  they used a metric given by taylor and poisson to find the _ dynamics of a black hole _ , i.e , those produced by an influx of gravitational energy across the horizon ( like tidal heating or increase in mass , angular momentum and surface area @xcite ) of the black hole .     our interest in this paper is mostly in the consequences of the tidal interactions on a _ photon orbital dynamics_. the metric given by taylor and poisson is not necessarily restricted to the weak field approximation and can be equally used in small hole approximation , in which the gravitating body is assumed to be much smaller than the second body . in our problem , we need to know the tidal fields and their effects on the structure of spacetime around the gravitating body , all within the weak field approximation to general relativity .    assuming that the photon path would not be too different from the schwarzchild light paths , we will include the force components in the osculating equations given in @xcite to obtain we would like to focus on the leading effects and neglect the smaller ones ;

[ ss : initialconditions ] , we ran the simulations for 50 myr . in those cases when we adopted slow injection velocities for the second jet ( v@xmath56@xmath49 ) , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision region .  [ ss : initialconditions ] , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision region .  [ ss : initialconditions ( see table  [ t : initialconditions ] and table  [ t : table1 ] for details ) .     the collision regions can be seen clearly in these figures as an enhancement in the projected energy marked by red . in each panel in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] , the two jets are moving from left to right nearly parallel to the horizontal axis ( simulation @xmath27 axis ) . in figure  [ f : projyenerall ] the first jet with fixed mach number ( m@xmath60 ) is moving left to right , the second jet , with different velocities , is moving in the opposite direction .     in the first column in figures  [ f : projzenerall ] and [ f : projyenerall ] we show jet collisions with zero impact parameter ( p = 0 ) . in all these cases  [ f : projzenerall ] and [ f : projyenerall ] , only one jet seems to emerge after the collision ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    in most of those cases where we adopted a finite impact parameter ( p @xmath61 ) , only two jets still propagate in roughly the same plane ( see figure  [ f : projyenerall ] ) , but the plane is rotated relative to the horizontal direction by an angle which is larger for smaller impact parameters and larger velocity differences between the two jets .    in those cases when the second jet is much slower than the first , the two jets may merge , and the bending angle after collision of the slower jet is larger for higher velocity differences between the two jets ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    in these cases, based on our results , we can classify colliding jets into two categories : ( 1 ) bouncing and ( 2 ) merging jets .     we illustrate the difference between these two categories in the first and second columns in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] . in this figure  [ f : test3356projz ] , we display the total energy density , scaled entropy per particle ( @xmath62 ) , enstrophy , @xmath63 ( see section  [ ss : enstrophy ] ) , and helicity , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the vorticity , @xmath66 , side of the energy panels marked with red ( see top left panel for each simulation ) .   [ f : test3356projz ] , it can be seen clearly from figure  [ f : test3356projz ] that , after the collision , the bouncing jets ( 1st column ) keep their identities and travel relatively unaffected , while , in the case of merging jets , after the collision , the faster jet absorbs the slower jet , although not instantly ( 2nd column ) .  [ f : test3356projz ] , we quantify the effect of jet collisions by projecting the total energy density of the system to the @xmath28 plane , @xmath70 , and measuring the spread of @xmath70 along a line parallel to the @xmath31 axis ( i.e , along a vertical line in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) at a distance of 15 kpc from the collision point ( @xmath71 $ ] ) , and identify the two regimes of the parameter space resulting in bouncing and merging jets . in figure  [ f : qphasediagram ] we plot the width of the projected total energy density where it is @xmath72 5% of its maximum value jet increases .        the jets merge when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small ( magenta and dark blue pixels ; p000v10 , p000v12 , p000v14 , p015v10 , p015v12 , and p030v10 , see table  [ t : table1 ] ) , otherwise they bounce . since the @xmath31 components of the velocities of the jets have opposite signs , the relative value of this component decreases ( it should be zero for v@xmath75 = v@xmath76 ) , and , as a consequence , the angle between the bouncing jets decreases as does the spread between them . have steeply decreasing amplitude as a function of the distance from the jet surface , and reflected body modes , which affect the entire gas in the jet .     the reflection modes dominate if m@xmath77 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?     ) is the characteristic cross section of the jet . studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations  [ f : projzenerall ] , we notice that as we increase the impact parameter , the instabilities decrease ( top to bottom in the 3rd column ; see also the trend from left to right in the different columns in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations  [ f : projzenerall ] , we notice that the jets in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] do not seem to expand where they meet , therefore the jets in our simulations with p = 1 and 1.3 do not actually collide .    studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations  [ f : projzenerall ] , we notice that , interestingly , comparing the 2nd and 3rd panels ( p = 1 and 1.3 ) in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] with the last panel ( p = @xmath81 ) , we notice that the two jets still interact with each other via turbulence , which enhances the instabilities and generates oscillations traveling down the jets .    studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations Medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] the effect of interaction between jets due to turbulence generated by collision can be quantified using the enstrophy density , the mean squared vorticity , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the vorticity at position @xmath85 ( note that , occasionally , it is defined without the 1/2 factor ) . in figure  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] we show the integrated enstrophy ( over @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) as a function of distance from the jet source ( the @xmath27 coordinate ) for different impact parameters : p = 0 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 , 0.60 , 0.80 , 1.00 , 1.3 , and @xmath81 in units of the jet diameter . the maximum distance to which the enstrophy shows the jets to propagate as coherent structures increases monotonically as the impact parameter  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] is increased , while the enstrophy peak drops significantly at @xmath86 , as the jet centers become separated by more than one jet radius .  [ f : enstro ] , and p130v18 ) . it can be seen from this figure that more enstrophy is generated right after the collision when we adopt smaller impact parameters . the largest enstrophy peaks ( @xmath89 ) belong to the four smallest impact parameters ( p = 0 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 ) .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows the maximum of the enstrophy as a function of the impact parameter for interacting jets ( @xmath90 ) .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows the maximum of the enstrophy as a function of the impact parameter for interacting jets ( @xmath90 ) .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows the enstrophy maximum shows a `` phase transition '' as a function of the impact parameter at a critical point , @xmath91 .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows a `` phase transition '' as a function of the impact parameter at a critical point , @xmath91 .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows a `` phase transition '' as a function of the impact parameter at a critical point , @xmath91 .  [ f : enstrophyv18 thus the enstrophy maximum are also reduced significantly .     as the jets are plunging through the ambient gas , their bulk kinetic energy dissipates into shocks and turbulence , and , as a result , they slow down . the dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy into turbulent energy can be quantified using the enstrophy density .     the scalar product of the curl of equation  [ e : euler2 ] with @xmath65 leads to the equation for enstrophy generation along the jet , @xmath98 where the left hand side of this equation is the lagrangian derivative , @xmath99 , and the source terms on the right hand side are the enstrophy stretching term , the compression term , and the baroclinic contribution , which is a result of the misalignment between the gradients of the gas density and the pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?     we illustrate the generation of enstrophy using our simulation with a small impact parameter , p = 0.15 , and injection velocities v@xmath75 = v@xmath76 = 18000 @xmath49 . in figure     [ f : enstrophgen ] we show the relative contributions from the [ e : enstrgen ] ) are fluctuating around zero , thus their time integral will be negligible and they do not contribute significantly to the enstrophy . the stretching term ( 1st term in equation  [ e : enstrgen ] ) � has a shape similar to the of the enstrophy ( black solid line ) . � as expected , this term is always positive ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ) , and , as a consequence , the contribution from stretching dominates the enstrophy generation . � note , however , that @xcite used equations of incompressible fluid dynamics in their analysis , and our simulations were based on compressible fluid dynamics , which is more appropriate for astrophysical applications . � the two bipolar jet system in 3c 75 is located in the dumbbell shaped twin wide angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxy ngc 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster abell 400 at a redshift of 0.023 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � @xcite concluded that the agns in 3c 75 form a bound system originating from a previous merger , and they are both contained in a low entropy gas in the ambient medium , and collision with other jets ) .    the ram pressure from a medium in transverse relative motion to the jet is the most common reason why jets show large - scale bends .     the smooth changes in the direction of the jets in 3c 75 farther from their agns are due to the relative movement of the agns to the ambient medium .     the smooth changes in the direction of the bending of the jets ( towards north - east ) suggests that 3c 75 is moving to the south - west .     in figure     in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure    in figure rotation angles around the direction of the propagation of the jet : @xmath100 0@xmath40 , 30@xmath40 , 60@xmath40 , 90@xmath40 , 120@xmath40 , 150@xmath40 \u001c ( top to bottom ) .  embodiments blue , red , and white colors represent positive , negative , and zero helicities . in projection ,  embodiments we have shown that a double helical feature can be seen in some viewing angles ( especially at @xmath100 0@xmath40 ) , which may give the impression that the two jets are spiraling around each other . however  embodiments we have shown that , in this case the jets merge , the faster jet takes over the slower one , and breaks into filaments due to the enhanced instabilities arising from the collision .  embodiments we have shown that the two filaments travel with a speed close to that of the faster jet and have no coherent rotational velocities perpendicular to their propagation , which would be necessary for helical motion . however , the filaments seem to have different helicities , coherent on the scale of a few kpc along their propagation direction , which may provide stability to these oscillating filaments ( right column in figure explanation is consistent with all observed features of 3c  75 .     we carried out hydrodynamical simulations to study extragalactic jet collisions . we found that colliding jets can be cast into two categories : bouncing and merging jets .    we have shown that two fast jets colliding with non - zero impact parameter bounce off each other keeping their identities , but jets with very different velocities colliding with a small impact parameter merge into one jet , and the faster jet takes over the slower jet .     we have found that the collision enhances the instabilities of the jets ; kpc scale oscillations are generated , and the jets may break up into filaments . in some projections , the filaments may show a twisted structure .    in general , magnetic fields in jets can reduce the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and , as a consequence , generate less turbulence , and can also affect the transport processes within the jets ( e.g. , * ?

dm ratio of 0.2 .     a larger baryon fraction reduces the particle mass . for the smallest @xmath1 solutions , resultant volume- and column density profiles     the model profiles are almost identical as shown in figs.[fermion.rho ] and [ fermion.sigma ] .     there are some deficiencies of mass densities inside the location of the radial critical curve , @xmath127 .     however , in 3d and 2d encircled mass profiles shown in figs.[fermion.m3 ] and [ fermion.m2 ] , these mass deficiencies s.[neu.rho ] and [ neu.sigma ] respectively . again \u001c the model profiles are always lower than the observed profile near the center . however , the discrepancy between the models and observation is negligible in the linear plots of the encircled masses shown in figs.[neu.m3 ] and [ neu.m2 ] . \u001c although @xmath1 depends on the baryon - dm ratio , @xmath114 , the resultant profiles are essentially identical and they are not distinguishable from the general fermion cases . for @xmath115 and 0.5 , the smallest mass solutions are for @xmath130 and 1.1 ev respectively . \u001c it is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath1312% ) of deficiency in the model 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( 1.06@xmath132 ) . \u001c it is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath1312% ) of deficiency in the model 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( 1.06@xmath132 ) . \u001c a brightest cluster galaxy at the center of a cluster , typically has a stellar mass in excess of in figs.[neu.rho ] and [ neu.sigma ] , the model galaxy remedies the local mass deficiency problem at the center . in fig.[neu.efek ] , the fermi levels @xmath135 and classical kinetic energies @xmath136 are plotted for the models without and with the toy galaxy .    this is because the toy galaxy acts as an external gravity source , whose effect on the 3d encircled mass is largest near the center .     this is because the gravity of the galaxy enhances the classical kinetic energy of a particle and dissolves the degeneracy .      this is the reason why there is a dip of the fermi level in the model with the galaxy . in other words ,    the degeneracy of the eos is softened locally by the stellar mass of the galaxy .    this is the reason why there is a dip of the fermi level in the model with the galaxy .     this is the reason why the degeneracy of the eos is softened locally by the stellar mass of the galaxy .     this is the reason why there is a dip of the fermi level in the oupling and that after they become nonrelativistic , under the assumption of adiabatic expansion .    the current cosmology assumes that there are the equal numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos for each species .    the current cosmology assumes that there are the equal numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos for each species .    so the present number density of each quantum statistically independent species , @xmath138 , is 112.6/2 = 56.3 @xmath47 . at redshift @xmath40 ,    the number density @xmath139 is given by    @xmath140    immediately after neutrino decoupling , when neutrinos were extremely relativistic , the fermi level , @xmath60 is given by    @xmath141^{1/3 } = 2.94 \\times 10^{-4 } ( 1+z)\\hskip 2 cm ( { \\rm ev}).\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the neutrino temperature then was    @xmath142    therefore the degree of degeneracy is given by @xmath148 ,    @xmath149^{2/3 } =   4.3\\times10^{-8 } m^{-1 } ( 1+z)^2\\hskip 2 cm ( { \\rm ev}),\\ ] ]    and    @xmath150    or    @xmath151    so the degree of degeneracy is    @xmath152    note that there is an offset of the zero point between the relativistic and nonrelativistic fermi levels given by @xmath153 , where the offset is negligible when particles are extremely relativistic . neutrinos can fall into the cluster core . ㅋ the cluster also has hot plasma , which may affect the fermion degeneracy . ㅋ here we briefly argue that the effect of hot plasma will be minor . ㅋ first of all , hot plasma and neutrinos ( or weakly interacting fermions in general ) interact only through gravity and the plasma temperature has nothing to do with the velocity dispersion of neutrinos , which is determined by the encircles mass at a given @xmath63 . ㅋ what matters is the plasma s contribution to the encircled mass ( or encircled gravitational energy if the plasma is relativistic ) . the ratio of gas mass and total mass has been estimated to be about 7% by x - ray observations ㅋ they interact with fermions only through newtonian gravity , because the plasma is not hot enough to be relativistic or the kinetic energy of a plasma particle is negligible compared to the rest - mass energy . therefore unless the plasma particles have exceptionally high concentration near the 3d center of the cluster , their effect on the encircled mass should be minor compared to that by the dark matter particles . however , an extreme high concentration is not expected unless the plasma temperature particle properties . � there may be a room for improvement in the phenomenological equation of state ( peos ) . � the peos used in this paper , eq([peos ] ) , overestimates the degeneracy pressure , @xmath56 , since @xmath56 here is the zero - temperature degeneracy pressure for a given number density , @xmath23 , regardless of the temperature of fermions or regardless of the degree of degeneracy . � for the same observed density profile , the best - fit model with a more realistic peos will require a higher number density , @xmath23 , or a lower particle mass . � another possible improvement is that without fixing the density ratio of total matter and light fermions , the densities of light fermions and collisionless cold dark matter particles can be treated separately in terms of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the former and the jean equation for the latter , while they are coupled through the total encircled mass and the common velocity dispersion at a given @xmath63 . � another possible improvement is that without fixing the density ratio of total matter and light fermions , the densities of light fermions and collisionless cold dark matter particles inos or fermionic hot dark matter in general , our expectation on the initial density fluctuation spectrum may need to be revised .   In this paper , we plan to investigate this potential effect quantitatively in the near future .  In addition to the observations in this paper , we have shown that the observed mass profile at the center of the cluster of galaxies , a1689 , is reproduced by models assuming the presence of degenerate fermionic dark matter . in the case that previously unknown fermions with spin 1/2 dominate the dark matter , the acceptable particle mass range is between 2 and 4 ev . in the case that the dark matter consists of the mixture of the degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles , the mass range of neutrinos is between 1 and 2 ev , if the ratio of the two kinds of dark matter particles is fixed to its cosmic value .  In this paper , we have shown that both the pure fermionic dark matter models and neutrino - cdm - mixture models reproduce the observations equally well .",

[ s : varmaoneonemainequation ] ) and the `` limiting spectral distributions , '' lsd ) of 8 cases , but also to derive a sixth  order equation ( [ eq : varmaoneonemainequation ] ) which produces the mean spectral density for a more involved @xmath6 model . � the results are verified by numerical simulations , which show a perfect agreement . � this is all done in sec . � [ s : varmafromfreerandomvariables ] . � @xmath2 stochastic processes , as we will see below , fall within quite a general set  up encountered in many areas of science where a probabilistic nature of multiple degrees of freedom evolving in time is relevant , for example , multivariate time series analysis in finance , applied macro  econometrics and engineering . to describe this framework , � we will consider a situation of @xmath3 time  moments , where the @xmath3 dependent random variables which are measured at @xmath4 consecutive time moments ( separated by some time interval @xmath9 ) ; let be the value od the @xmath10th ( @xmath11 ) random number at the @xmath12th time moment ( @xmath13 ) ; together , they make up a rectangular @xmath14 matrix @xmath moments are factorized , _ realizations in actual experiments , _ i.e. _ , the sample . \u001c since the realized cross  covariance between degrees @xmath10 and @xmath24 at the same time @xmath12 is , the simplest method to estimate the today s cross  covariance is to compute the time average , @xmath25 this is usually named the `` pearson estimator '' , up to the prefactor which depending on the context is @xmath26 or @xmath27 . \u001c other estimators might be introduced , such as between distinct degrees of freedom at separate time moments ( `` time  delayed estimators '' ) , or with certain decreasing weights given to older measurements to reflect their growing obsolescence ( `` weighted estimators '' ) , but we will not investigate them in this article . \u001c furthermore , in the last equality in ( [ eq : estimatorcdefinition ] ) , we cast @xmath28 through the uncorrelated gaussian numbers contained in , the price to pay for this being that the covariance matrices now enter into the expression for @xmath28 , making it more complicated ; this will be the form used hereafter . \u001c the random matrix @xmath28 is called a `` doubly ; it will reflect the true covariances only to a certain degree , with a superimposed broadening due to the finiteness of the time series .     more precisely , there are @xmath31 independent elements in @xmath18 , to be estimated from @xmath32 measured quantities @xmath15 , hence the estimation accuracy will depend on the `` rectangularity ratio , '' @xmath33 the closer @xmath29 to zero , the more truthful the estimate .    this is a cornerstone of classical multivariate analysis .     this is a practical situation will typically feature a large number of variables sampled over a comparably big number of time snapshots , so that we may approximately talk about the `` thermodynamical limit , '' @xmath34 on the other hand , it is exactly this limit in which the frv calculus ( see the subsection below for its brief elucidation ) can be applied ; hence , the challenge of de  noising is somewhat counterbalanced by the computationally powerful frv techniques .    on the practical side , any study of a ( real symmetric @xmath36 ) random matrix @xmath37 will most surely include a fundamental question about the average values of its ( the two equivalent objects , @xmath42 referred to as the `` green s function '' ( or the `` resolvent '' ) and the `` @xmath35transform '' of @xmath37 . \u001c the latter is also called the `` moments generating function , '' since if the `` moments '' of @xmath37 exist , it can be expanded into a power series around @xmath43 as . � it should however be underlined that even for probability measures disallowing such an expansion ( heavy  tailed distributions , preeminent in finance , being an example ) , the quantities ( [ eq : greenfunctionandmtransformdefinition ] ) still manage to entirely capture the spectral properties of @xmath37 ; hence the name `` @xmath35transform '' more appropriate , in addition to being more compact . � we will show that for our purposes ( multiplication of random matrices ; see par . � [ sss : thentransformandfreerandomvariables ] ) the @xmath35transform serves better than the green s function . � however , it is customary to write the relationship between ( [ eq : meanspectraldensitydefinition ] ) and ( [ eq : greenfunctionandmtransformdefinition ] pdfs , which proves to be additive . in matrix probability theory ,    a crucial insight came from d.  voiculescu and coworkers and r.  speicher  @xcite , who showed how to parallel the commutative construction in the noncommutative world .    in matrix probability theory ,    it starts with the notion of `` freeness , '' which basically comprises probabilistic independence together with a lack of any directional correlation between two random matrices .    in matrix probability theory , this nontrivial new property happens to be the right extension of classical independence , as it allows for an efficient algorithm of multiplying free random variables ( frv ) , which we state below :    step 1 : : :   suppose we have two random matrices , and , mutually free .    they are best wrought into the    @xmath35transforms    ( [ eq : greenfunctionandmtransformdefinition ] ) , and .    step 2 : : :   the critical maneuver is to turn attention to the functional inverses    of these @xmath35transforms , the so  called    `` @x on the choice of the @xmath35transform as the carrier of the mean spectral information , and the construction of its functional inverse , the @xmath3transform , which essentially multiplies under taking the free product ) resolves the multiplication problem for free random noncommutative objects . of matrices down to their constituents ) , in order to reduce the problem to solving the uncorrelated wishart ensemble .    in this communication ,    this last model is further simplified , again by the cyclic property and the frv multiplication rule applied once , to the standard @xmath49 random matrix squared ( and the projector , designed to chip the rectangle off the square @xmath49 ) , whose properties are firmly established .     in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication ,    in this communication , xcite . @@@@@@@@ in what follows , we will assume that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 stochastic processes are covariance ( weak ) stationary ; for details , we refer to  @xcite . @@@@@@@@ it implies certain restrictions on their parameters , but we will not bother with this issue in the current work . @@@@@@@@ another consequence is that the processes display some interesting features , such as invertibility . @@@@@@@@ for all this , we must in particular take both @xmath3 and @xmath4 large from the start , with their ratio @xmath55 fixed ( [ eq : thermodynamicallimit ] ) . @@@@@@@@ more precisely , we stretch the range of the @xmath12index from minus to plus infinity . @@@@@@@@ this means that all the finite  size effects ( appearing at the ends of the time series ) are readily disregarded . @@@@@@@@ in particular , there is no need to care about initial conditions for the processes , and all the recurrence relations are assumed to continue to the infinite past . @@@@@@@@ we consider a situation when @xmath3 stochastic variables evolve according to identical independent @xmath0 ( vector moving average ) processes , which we sample which reflects the fact that the processes are identical and independent ( no `` spatial '' covariances among the variables ) .      in order to handle such a process , the rank @xmath59 of the process is a positive integer .      in order to handle such a process ( [ eq : vmaqdefinition ] ) , notice that the s , being linear combinations of uncorrelated gaussian numbers , must also be gaussian random variables , albeit displaying some correlations  . , @xmath65    in this representation , the @xmath35transform of is readily obtained  @xcite , @xmath66 this integral can be evaluated by the method of residues for any value of @xmath59 , which we do in appendix  [ ss : themtransformoftheautocovariancematrixforvmaq ] , where also we print the general result ( [ eq : vmaqgreenfunctionoftheautocovariancematrix ] ) . in particular , for @xmath67 , @xmath68 where the square roots are principal .      we will be interested in investigating the spectral properties of the pearson estimator ( [ eq : estimatorcdefinition ] ) . the @xmath35transform of this correlated wishart random matrix , , can be retrieved from equation ( [ eq : doublycorrelatedwishartensemblethemainequation3 ] ) .      we could write it for any @xmath59 using ( [ eq : vmaqgreenfunctionoftheautocovariancematrix ] ) , but we will restrict ourselves only to @xmath67 , in which case the substitution of ( [ eq : 6 ) , and to compare the two , one needs to change their variables into ours according to @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and . covariance matrix of the corresponding @xmath0 process with the described modification of the parameters , @xmath79 this inverse exists thanks to the weak stationarity supposition .     the fourier transform of the auto  covariance matrix of @xmath1 is therefore a ( number ) inverse of its counterpart for @xmath0 with its parameters appropriately changed , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and where we define .    in order to find the @xmath35transform of the inverse matrix , , one employs a general result , true for any ( real symmetric ) random matrix @xmath37 , and obtainable through an easy algebra , @xmath82 since the quantity is known for any @xmath59 ( [ eq : vmaqgreenfunctionoftheautocovariancematrix ] ) , hence is via ( [ eq : mhinversefrommh ] ) , in which case ( [ eq : mhinversefrommh ] ) and ( [ eq : vmaonemomentsgeneratingfunctionfora ] ) yield @xmath67 , in which case ( [ eq : vmaonemomentsgeneratingfunctionfora ] ) yield @xmath83 maq ] , and we do this in appendix  [ ss : theautocovariancematrixforvarq ] . \u001c we discover that the auto  covariance matrix is a sum of @xmath59 exponential decays , @xmath85 where are constants , and are the characteristic times ( [ eq : varqautocovariancematrixcharacteristictimes ] ) , @xmath86 ;

This paper is organized as follows: mass difference of about 77mev between @xmath11 and @xmath20 , the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 channels plays an important role . for the determination of a @xmath8 effective interaction    in the general theory of constructing a @xmath8 effective interaction , we introduce a model space consisting of low - momentum @xmath8 states .    in the general theory of constructing a @xmath8 effective interaction , we let @xmath42 be the projection operator onto the model space .    in the general theory of constructing a @xmath8 effective interaction , the complement of the @xmath43 space includes a space of high - momentum @xmath8 states referred to as the @xmath8 states referred to as the @xmath44 space and a space of all the @xmath7 states referred to as the @xmath45 space .     in the general theory of constructing a hermitian effective interaction , the condition of decoupling for the transformed interaction @xmath41 is given by @xmath46 hereafter , we refer to the above equation as the decoupling equation .     in the general theory of constructing a hermitian effective interaction , we assume that the one - body part @xmath47 in eq .   is decoupled as @xmath48 on the above assumption overline{\\psi_{{\\sst { \\it \\lambda n}}k } }    where @xmath60 is the @xmath52-space component of @xmath57 defined by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : psc }     that the solution @xmath39 in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : syn ] ) is determined dependently on the choice of a set of @xmath63 eigenstates @xmath64 as given in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : oyn ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : shyn ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : shyn ] ) , the @xmath63 eigenstates @xmath64 are defined by the @xmath63 eigenstates @xmath64 as given in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : syn ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we choose a set of @xmath65 so that they have the largest @xmath52-space overlaps among all the eigenstates in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : eige ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is a usual choice in the derivation of the effective interaction .    with the solution @x potential of @xmath32 calculated with the @xmath8 effective interaction @xmath77 as @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 are the single - particle states of @xmath32 and @xmath19 , respectively .    from eqs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : evln])-([eq : nhevln ] ) we see that the @xmath8 effective interaction @xmath81 can be calculated once the operator @xmath82 is given .  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the operator @xmath82 is determined completely , as given in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : oyn ] ) , by solving the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eige ] ) and selecting @xmath63 eigenstates @xmath65 with the largest @xmath52-space overlaps . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ it is noted here that eqs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq : syn])-([eq : ul ] ) give a set of equations that determines the @xmath8 effective interaction @xmath77 self - consistently with the single - particle potential @xmath76 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ here we discuss a calculation procedure for obtaining the @xmath8 effective interaction acting in a small model as for @xmath37 we employ a fixed potential calculated previously for closed shell nuclei in the umoa @xcite .     although we have not known clearly how much the effect of the single - particle potential @xmath36 on the @xmath8 effective interaction has not necessarily been clarified , although some calculations with @xmath36 have been made for the @xmath13-matrices in hyperonic nuclear matter @xcite . in the actual calculations made so far the single - particle potential \u001c @xmath36 has been considered to be rather shallow @xcite .     in the actual calculations made so far , although we have not known clearly how much the effect of @xmath36 on the @xmath8 effective interaction , we here assume @xmath84 .    in solving the self - consistent equation for @xmath35 with @xmath81 we should be careful in the following two respects : ( a ) in the calculation of energies of intermediate states in propagators we should use @xmath35 that is given for @xmath83 states including high - momentum states . in order to do this \u001c we need a @xmath8 effective interaction acting in a large model space a usual sense . by introducing a small model space and using the @xmath8 effective interaction determined in the first - step calculation � , we proceed to the second - step calculation where we calculate a @xmath8 effective interaction acting in this small model space of low - lying @xmath87 states . � ( b ) it is important in actual calculations how to determine the @xmath88 and @xmath85 spaces because an effective interaction is determined dependently on the choice of the @xmath88 and @xmath85 spaces . � if a state in the @xmath88 space mixes strongly with @xmath85-space states in the eigenstate in eq . � ( [ eq : eige ] ) , the matrix element of @xmath89 or @xmath54 defined in sec . � 2 becomes large and as a result higher - order many - body correlations @xcite give rise to non - negligible contributions . � in general , the strong mixing takes place when some of the @xmath88- and @xmath85-space states are quasi - degenerate in energy . for this reason � , we should choose the @xmath88 and @xmath85 spaces which are well define a space of all the @xmath7 states denoted by @xmath95 as @xmath96 note that the model space @xmath91 does not contain the @xmath7 states . � if we make a graph of two - particle states , the @xmath97 , @xmath92 and @xmath98 spaces are represented in fig .  1 . � the @xmath93 means a number such that @xmath99 gives the maximum kinetic energy of the @xmath8 two - particle states in the @xmath97 space . � the @xmath100 denotes the unit of the h.o . � the @xmath93 means a number such that @xmath93 gives the maximum kinetic energy of the @xmath8 two - particle states in the @xmath97 space . � the @xmath100 denotes the unit of the h.o . � energy which we use commonly for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath19 . � as we require to introduce a sufficiently large model space in the first - step calculation , we should choose @xmath93 as large as possible . � another requirement is that the states in the @x - particle states in the @xmath111 and @xmath112 spaces .      we then write the @xmath111 and @xmath112 spaces as @xmath111 and @xmath112 spaces as @xmath113 and @xmath114 we also define the sum of the excluded spaces as @xmath115 furthermore , by using the projection operators , @xmath101 , @xmath116 , @xmath95 and @xmath117 , we introduce projection operators onto the spaces of allowed @xmath12 states as @xmath118 @xmath119 and we also define @xmath120 considering the pauli - exclusion principle for nucleons the terms @xmath121 and @xmath122 should be removed in treating the problem of two - body correlations .      however , if we remove all the matrix elements of these terms , this leads to overmuch counting of the pauli principle .      the pauli - exclusion principle for nucleons the matrix elements which are diagonal in nucleon states should be restored even though nucleons are in occupied states .     the pauli principle for nucleons should be restored even though nucleons are in occupied states @xmath12 interaction in the first - step calculation is given by @xmath135 the decoupling equation for determining the correlation operator @xmath136 becomes @xmath137 the @xmath8 effective interaction @xmath138 in the @xmath97 space is then given by @xmath139 in the first - step procedure we solve the decoupling equation ( [ eq : dece1 ] ) by introducing some assumptions . as we take a sufficiently large number as @xmath140 \u001c it has been shown , however , we may assume that the one - body potential of @xmath83 for a state in the @xmath101 space is negligible in comparison with the sum of the energies , @xmath141 . \u001c therefore , @xmath142 takes nonzero values only for states in the @xmath91 space , and we have @xmath143 the definitions of @xmath97 and @xmath92 in eq . � ( [ eq : dtps ] ) allow us to divide a space of @xmath8 states written in relative and center - of - mass ( c.m . ) � coordinates into the same subspaces @xmath97 and @xmath92 as @xmath the @xmath5 interaction @xmath153 in eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ it has been shown , however , in the calculation of ordinary nuclei that @xmath153 is not diagonal in the c.m . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ quantum numbers @xmath154 because the projection operators @xmath97 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are not diagonal in @xmath154 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ thus , the @xmath8 effective interaction @xmath157 is not diagonal in @xmath154 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ it has been shown , however , in the calculation of ordinary nuclei that @xmath154 non - diagonal elements of the @xmath13-matrix are generally small @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we make an assumption that the @xmath154 non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath157 can be neglected . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the two - body eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eige1 ] ) is solved for the relative motion with a fixed set of @xmath158 written by @xmath159 where we rewrite @xmath160 as @xmath161 the @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the kinetic energies of the @xmath5 relative and c.m . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ motions , respectively . � however , it has been shown in the calculation in nuclei that if we take a larger number as @xmath167 , the effect of violating the assumption of decoupling becomes considerably smaller @xcite . � we have confirmed that this non - decoupling effect becomes negligible in calculating nuclear effective interactions . � we here assume this to be the case also in the determination of the @xmath8 effective interaction . � furthermore , we introduce another approximation that the sum of @xmath168 and @xmath169 be diagonal in the c.m . � quantum numbers @xmath170 and @xmath171 . � this assumption has also been made sure to be acceptable in the previous works @xcite .    in order to solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eige1r ] ) we need to calculate the matrix elements of @xmath172 in the relative and c.m . � however , the calculation of these matrix elements is difficult because the term @xmath172 can not be separated into a sum of operators written in relative and c.m . coordinates . � this assumption has also been made sure to be acceptable in the previous works @xcite . -

step procedure , we may write the @xmath8 effective interaction in the @xmath213 space as @xmath234 . � we , therefore , have used partly the @xmath87 effective interaction @xmath157 in the calculation of @xmath233 . � we remark here that we employ @xmath157 as the effective interaction in the @x diagonal terms of @xmath235 . by taking the diagonal part of @xmath235 as the unperturbed hamiltonian � we calculate these corrections perturbatively up to second order as shown in diagram ( a ) of fig .  3 .    next � , the interaction between the @xmath8 states in the @xmath214 and @xmath208 spaces induces the core polarization in the core nucleus , and is important in the calculation of the corrections . � we here assume that these corrections can be calculated approximately , using the interaction @xmath238 it will be desirable to take into account the effect of intermediate nucleon states with high momentum . in this perturbative calculation � we include only the nucleon states belonging to the @xmath208 space , that is , the nucleon h.o . � we here assume that the nucleon h.o . � we here assume that these corrections can be calculated approximately , using the quantum numbers of a @xmath83 state . the validity of this truncation of nucleon states will be checked in the numerical calculation in the next section by increasing the number @xmath241 . � we include only the nucleon states belonging to the @xmath value @xmath100 has been already discussed in @xmath15o @xcite and we confirmed that the dependence was quite small around @xmath243mev if perturbation corrections were included . as for the nucleon single -

angle @xmath137 .    at this juncture , we take monotonically with energy with @xmath140 greater than @xmath141 for @xmath143 gev . for the annihilation process @xmath7 � , one has @xmath144 . � hence the deepcore sensitivity to this process should be better than that presented in fig .  2 , which starts from @xmath145 gev . � for @xmath10 mode , @xmath146 gev corresponds to @xmath147 gev . at this energy , � the value @xmath148 overestimates the effective volume by about a factor of 2 , thus the deepcore sensitivity to @xmath149 should be corrected by a factor of @xmath150 . � the correction factor gradually reduces to @xmath151 as @xmath26 approaches to about @xmath152 gev , which corresponds to @xmath153 gev . for @xmath154 gev , � the deepcore sensitivity calculated with @xmath140 is better than that presented in fig .  2 . � the correction factor for @xmath11 is similar to that for @xmath155 requires different correction factor for the same @xmath26 . � the correction factor gradually reduces to @xmath151 how the deepcore sensitivity on dm annihilation cross section varies with the chosen cone half - angle and threshold energy for nfw dm density profile . here � we take @xmath10 channel for illustration . � 3 shows the required dm annihilation cross section @xmath149 for a @xmath132 detection in five years for different cone half - angle @xmath159 . � it is seen that the sensitivity is improved as @xmath159 increases from @xmath160 to @xmath161 while it turns weaker as @xmath159 increases further . in the latter case , � the signal increases slower than the background does . � we should point out that the choice of @xmath159 depends on the angular resolution of the experiment . � the current angular resolution in icecube for cascade events is @xmath162 . � however , an improvement on such a resolution is expected  @xcite . � in fact , new reconstruction method which can achieve a @xmath163 angular resolution for cascade events in large - scale neutrino telescopes has been proposed  @xcite . hence results shown in fig . � the current angular resolution is @xmath164 can be realized in the near future . in this choosing @xmath136 .     in fact , one expects the situation turns opposite for @xmath26 approaching to the threshold energy .     in fact , for @xmath169 gev , one can see that the sensitivity on dm annihilation cross section obtained with @xmath136 is always better than that obtained with @xmath170 .      in addition , we note that the deepcore sensitivities on other annihilation channels have similar cone half - angle and threshold energy dependencies . from the above discussions , we observe that , in contrast to the main concern of this article , raising the threshold energy increases sensitivity for probing heavier dm .    in fact , as the threshold energy approaches to @xmath171 gev , one enters into the operative energy range of the full icecube array such that the effective volume of the detector increases more rapidly with the threshold energy than the case with deepcore detector alone  @xcite .     in fact , we observe that the same situation holds for probing dm annihilation with track events .     for einasto  @xmath149 , nfw  @xcite , isothermal  @xciteand nfw  @xcite usped profile . � therefore the deepcore sensitivity on @xmath149 with einasto profile becomes poorer as @xmath159 increases . � in addition , we can see from fig .  1 that the dm density of einasto profile is higher than that of nfw profile between 0.1 kpc and 5 kpc from the gc , and both density profiles are almost identical beyond this range of distances . � hence the deepcore sensitivity on @xmath149 with einasto profile is better than that with nfw profile for @xmath137 . � next , we also present in fig . � 4 the expected deepcore sensitivities for different @xmath159 with isothermal dm density profile . � because there is a core in the central dm density distribution of isothermal profile , we refer to this class of profile as the cusped profile . � we note that the sensitivity to dm annihilation cross section with isothermal profile improves as @xmath159 increases from @xmath160 to @xmath162 while the sensitivity with einasto profile behaves oppositely . � this is because there is a core in the central dm density distribution of isothermal .     as a function of @xmath26 such that the neutrino signature from dm annihilations can be detected at the @xmath132 significance in five years for track and cascade events.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm    having discussed the effect of dm density profiles on the derived deepcore sensitivities , we present in fig .  5 the comparison of deepcore sensitivities to @xmath149 obtained by measuring cascade events and track events , respectively .   5 we note that nfw profile is adopted for results in this figure as well as results presented in the remaining figures of this article .   5 we like to point out that @xmath74 is the dominant flavor of atmospheric neutrinos above few tens of gev and the neutrino - nucleon cross section are almost the same for all flavors .    5 the signal to background ratio is enhanced in cascade events because @xmath74 only produces the cascade events because @xmath74 only produces the cascade events through the neutral - current interaction , which is lower in cross section than that of charged - current interaction .    5 we like to point out that @xmath data at @xmath174 c.l .     the dashed line is the dsphs constraint at @xmath174 c.l .     the dotted line is the constraint due to fermi - lat observations on the region @xmath175 plus a @xmath176 square region centered at gc , assuming the nfw profile  @xcite .      the thick and thin solid lines are the expected @xmath132 sensitivities of deepcore detector with @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm    it is interesting and essential to compare our results with constraints obtained from gamma - ray astronomy and cosmology .    the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat )  @xcite is a pair - conversion telescope that explores the gamma - ray sky in the 20 mev to 300 gev range with unprecedented sensitivity . in a recent work ,    the fermi - lat collaboration derive constraints on wimp annihilation or decay into various final states which produce a continuous photon spectrum  @xcite .    the fermi - lat 132 sensitivities on @xmath10 annihilation cross section by the deepcore detector with @xmath137 and @xmath158 are plotted for comparison . and @xcite , where the former work is based on the recent wmap 7-year data  @xcite while the latter one combines wmap 7-year and act 2008  @xcite data .     we present the above two cmb constraints on @xmath10 annihilation cross section in fig .    as a function of @xmath26 , one can see that the thick solid line is higher than the dot - dot - dashed line ( @xmath174 c.l . ) by roughly a factor of 2 .     the deepcore sensitivity is comparable to the cmb constraint with @xmath158 , thus the expected sensitivity of icecube deepcore detector with @xmath137 is slightly weaker than the cmb constraint .     , however , the deepcore sensitivity is comparable to the cmb constraint with @xmath158 .     as a function of @xmath26 , it should be noted that the dm annihilation cross section could be velocity dependent .     and hence , a model dependent extrapolation on dm annihilation cross section might be required to compare the constraint on @xmath183 at redshift @xmath182 to that at the present day universe @xcite . @@@@@@@@ satellite galaxies are among the best targets to search for dm signals in gamma rays because of small background from astrophysical sources and a favorable signal to noise ratio . in ref . @@@@@@@@ @xcite , fermi - lat collaboration derive upper limits on dm annihilation cross sections by applying a joint likelihood analysis to 24 months of data from 10 satellite galaxies with uncertainties on the dark matter distributions in the satellite galaxies taken into account . @@@@@@@@ we present the dsphs constraint on @xmath10 annihilation cross section at @xmath174 c.l . in fig .  @@@@@@@@ 6 . for @xmath187 , @@@@@@@@ the expected deepcore sensitivity curves are below that set by dsphs constraint for both @xmath137 and @xmath158 . for @xmath188 @@@@@@@@ gev , the dsphs constraint is comparable to the expected deepcore sensitivity with @xmath158 .   @@@@@@@@ thus it is stronger than the expected deepcore sensitivity with @xmath137 in this dm mass range .     as a function of @xmath26 such that the neutrino signature from dm decays @@@@@@@@ can be detected at the @xmath132 significance ino spectrum through @xmath10 is harder than that through @xmath155 , the gamma ray spectra through the above annihilations behave differently . math186 channel requires the lowest decay rate ( longest decay time ) to avoid a @xmath132 detection significance in five years of deepcore data taking .  perspect we note that the energy - dependent effective volume @xmath140  @xcite downgrades the sensitivity to @xmath192 decay time by roughly a factor of 1.5 at @xmath193 gev , which corresponds to @xmath194 gev .  perspect however , the sensitivity to @xmath192 obtained with @xmath140 is better than that presented in fig .  8 for @xmath195 gev , which corresponds to @xmath196 gev . for @xmath191 mode ,  perspect the sensitivity at @xmath193 gev is lower by a factor of @xmath26 by applying @xmath140 , since such a @xmath26 corresponds to lowest possible neutrino energy @xmath142 gev .  perspect however , @xmath140 shall enhance the sensitivity for @xmath196 gev , which corresponds to @xmath196 gev , assuming @xmath196 gev .  perspect the correction factor for @xmath191 is similar to that for @xmath191 , while the hadronic mode @xmath the sensitivity curve rises as @xmath159 increases from @xmath160 to @xmath162 . as @xmath159 increases in this cone half - angle range , the dm event rate increases faster than that of atmospheric background .    in fig .  11 , however , the sensitivity is not further improved by increasing @xmath159 from @xmath162 to @xmath203 .    in fig .  11 , we also show the required dm decay time for a @xmath132 detection significance in five years with @xmath204 and @xmath205 for comparison .    in fig .  11 , it has been pointed out in ref .  11 , we also show the sensitivity given by @xmath205 gives rise to the highest sensitivity on dm decay time for @xmath170 .    in fig .  11 , we note that the sensitivity on dm decay time is improved by lowering @xmath166 from @xmath167 gev to @xmath168 gev for @xmath206 gev .    in fig .  11 , it is of interest to compare sensitivities on dm decay time given by cascade events and track events . in fig . factor @xmath210 applied since we have adopted a local density of @xmath25 while fermi - lat analysis uses @xmath180 . in the same figure , we also show the expected @xmath132 sensitivities to @xmath191 and @xmath190 decay time by the deepcore detector with @xmath137 for comparisons . for the deepcore detector , � the sensitivity to the @xmath191 decay time is better than that to the @xmath190 decay time , since the neutrino spectrum in the former channel is harder than the one in the latter channel . on the other hand , the fermi - lat data in general gives more stringent constraint on @xmath190 decay time than its constraint on the decay time of @xmath191 . � this is because that the gamma ray spectrum from the former channel dominates over the one from the latter channel for most of the range of @xmath189 , as the dm annihilation case . � if dm decays predominantly into @xmath1 , one can see that the decay time sensitivity expected at deepcore is comparable to the constraint given by fermi - lat data . � this is because that the gamma ray spectrum from the former channel with @xmath212 oscillations taken into account for neutrino energies less than @xmath213 gev . � the signal event rate is calculated by taking nfw profile for dm density distribution in the galactic halo . among all dm annihilation and decay channels , � the annihilation mode @xmath7 and the decay mode @xmath192 provide the best search sensitivity , while the search sensitivity provided by the annihilation mode @xmath155 and the decay mode @xmath214 is the poorest . � it is important to compare the expected sensitivities of deepcore detector to dm annihilation cross section and decay time with the existing constraints on the same quantities obtained by cosmology and fermi - lat gamma - ray observations . � it is seen that the fermi - lat constraints on @xmath155 and @xmath214 are much stronger than the expected deepcore sensitivities to the same channels . � it is important to compare the expected sensitivities of deepcore detector to dm annihilation cross section and decay time with the existing constraints on the same quantities obtained by cosmology and fermi - lat gamma - ray observations . � it is seen that the fermi - lat constraints on @xmath155 i - lat constraint based upon gamma - ray data from the galactic halo . from the above comparisons , � there remain slight possibilities to observe dm induced neutrino signature from the galactic halo provided dm annihilates or decays predominantly into leptons . � it should be noted that fermi - lat and cmb data does not directly set limits on @xmath7 or @xmath192 modes with monochromatic neutrinos . there � there exist models @xcite in which @xmath7 and @xmath192 are dominant annihilation and decay modes , respectively . in the annihilation case � @xcite for example , the dm candidate can be the lightest right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino in a @xmath215 extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . � each rh sneutrinos annihilate into a pair of rh neutrinos . � each of these rh neutrinos then decays into ordinary left - handed ( lh ) neutrino and a neutral higgs boson while the decay of rh neutrino into charged final states @xmath216 is typically forbidden in such a model . in the case � that the mass difference halo with neutrino telescopes in the northern hemisphere . � generally a neutrino telescope in such a location has advantages in detecting track -

the distinguishing feature of we sampling , compared to other resampling techniques , is that our interest in we arises from in this article we see for instance  @xcite for review and comparison of these methods .    in this article we will compare we to exact milestoning in section  [ sec : dynamics ] below .    in this article  @xcite , we give a mathematical framework for we based on martingale theory .    in this article  @xcite , the framework allows us to prove that we is exact even when the bins and the number of replicas per bin are chosen adaptively , as noted earlier in  @xcite . while we can be used with a broad range of stochastic processes , when the process is time homogenous and markovian  as in many models of md , such as langevin dynamics  we can be used to efficiently compute dynamical quantities like reaction rates without actually simulating the reactions  @xcite .    in this article  @xcite , these computations rely on hill s relation  @xcite , which we generalize in section  [ sec : dynamics ] below . from hill  s relation , obtaining reaction rates and probabilities requires a calculation on the stationary distribution of a nonreversible process . to speed up this stationary calculation , We introduce adaptive sampling , in contrast with traditional we sampling .     we show in a simple model that this adaptive sampling can be significantly better than traditional we sampling .    this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we introduce notation for the replica processes , and we make assumptions on we sampling that we assume hold throughout .    in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we introduce notation for the replica processes , and we make assumptions on we sampling that we assume hold throughout

   in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we prove that we is unbiased in a general setting that includes adaptive binning procedures . in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we introduce an explicit algorithm for we sampling ( algorithm  [ alg1 ] ) and prove that it is unbiased ( proposition  [ prop1 ] below ) .    in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we give an exact formula for the mean squared error of this sampling ( proposition  [ prop2 ] ) . @xmath1 .    below we consider sampling schemes for @xmath1 of the following type .    below we consider sampling schemes for @xmath5 and @xmath6 of

? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) . after approximately 10@xmath16 years � , sio depletes out of the gas phase again and the abundance drops ( i.e. * ? ? ? � because of the short enhancement lifetime , sio is generally only detectable in regions which have recently been shocked . � where we detect sio ( j=4 - 3 ) we suggest there is ongoing outflow activity . � we present the column density of sio towards each source in table [ tab : sio_prop ] . � we can divide this value by the abundance of sio with respect to h@xmath17 in order to determine the column density of shocked gas in each region . � these values are also presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] . � we present the column density of @xcite is dependent on the assumed distance to the source ( see their equations 7 and 12 ) .    thus , our sio abundance has changed from -9.53 in paper 1 to -10.42 when the new distance and revised column density are taken into account .    thus , the sio abundance determined for k3 - 50a in paper 1 is much closer to that found in dark clouds than in outflow regions .    thus , the region in which sio is emitting is unresolved by our observations and highly beam diluted .     thus , for our analysis , we have assumed an sio abundance of -10.15 , the average abundance from our other six sources .     based on the abundance estimates presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] , we have determined the total column of shocked material towards each source , from which we determined the mass of shocked gas because we know the area of the emitting region ( see below ) . for our sources which are unresolved in sio    , we have taken the radius of our primary beam to be the radius of the emitting region .    comparing the integrated intensities of our sio emission in the central pixel of each map r@xmath21 ) .    the method used to determine the deconvolved source size was described in section [ sec : observations ] , and the radius of the emitting region is presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] . from this radius and the shock velocity determined above , we can constrain the ages of our outflows from simple kinematic arguments . these approximate outflow urn ages are presented in table [ tab : hco_prop ] and are used later to constrain the amount of infalling material .    in order for the outflow shocks to reach their observed sizes given the mass of shocked gas , the powering sources for these outflows must produce enough energy to push through the ambient medium .    if we assume a steady wind is driving a spherical bubble of gas outward , we can use the model of @xcite to determine the luminosity required to push the ambient gas .    the equation 6 of @xcite can be re - expressed as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the luminosity imparted by the wind , @xmath24 is the radius of the bubble , @xmath25 is the shock velocity , and related to � these thermal energies are of approximately the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energies calculated for the co outflows in a number of massive star forming regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; similarly the wind luminosities are comparable to the luminosities of their hii regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; and many authors suggest that an asymmetric self absorbed line profile of an optically thick line tracer in which the blue emission peak is brighter than the red , and the optically thin tracer has a single line peak , can be indicative of infall ( i.e. * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � , our optically thick line is hco@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) and the optically thin isotopologue is h@xmath1co@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) .    from paper 1 � , we expected to observe infall signatures in g10.47 and g19.61 .    from paper 1 it was known to have small scale infall motions .    in paper 1 , it too is seen to have a large scale infall signature .    in paper 1    in paper 2 , we suggested that beam dilution may have been a contributing factor as to why we did not detect infall in a number of sources .    the fact that we have detected extended infall in two distant ( @xmath32 6 kpc ) sources in this study suggests that if beam dilution of the signal is a problem , it only affects intrinsically smaller sources , and not intrinsically more distant ones , since our unresolved detections are for g19.61 and g20.08 at 4.5 and 4.1 kpc .    in paper 1 , our infall velocities were calculated for each self absorbed hco@xmath0 spectrum towards g10.47 , g10.6 , g19.61 , and g20.08 using the models of @xcite in the same way as described in paper 1 . from our rms uncertainties in line temperatures and the spectral resolution of our observations , we determined the uncertainties associated with our derived infall velocities .     we used these uncertainties to limit the regions in which .    it is quite possible that there is a second instance of a collapsing region here since sio is marginally detected ( at the 3@xmath13 level ) in the middle of this northern extension .     the double peaked profiles do lead to infall velocities ( in three pixels ) which are greater than 3@xmath13 ; however , we do not include this region in our infall analysis for a number of reasons .     the infall signature is not continuous from the central region to this northern region , which suggests that there are two distinct regions of infall .     this discontinuity would confuse conclusions about the central infall region .     and similarly , we are interested in the infall activity surrounding hii regions , where we know massive stars are forming .     we are interested in the infall activity surrounding hii regions , where we know massive stars are forming .     we are interested in the infall activity surrounding hii regions , where we know massive stars are forming .     neither the mid infrared nor radio maps of this region ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) extend far enough to the north to determine whether there are hii regions in this northern extension xmath34 m@xmath33 ) assuming constant infall rates over the lifetime of the outflow . averaging the spectra and then determining the infall velocity increased the infall velocity by increasing the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line . since the infall velocity varies as the fwhm squared ( see equation 9 of * ? ? ? * ) , this broadening leads to an overestimate of the infall velocity . is interesting to note that the infall and outflow signatures in g19.61 are both unresolved , and the signatures in g20.08 are both marginally resolved .       this comparison suggests that the shocked region , as traced by sio , may have a similar physical size as the infall regions in these smaller sources . towards g10.6 and g10.47 , the regions over which we have robustly detected extended infall , our deconvolved sio emitting regions also appear to be on the same approximate spatial scales .           when comparing infall mass and outflow mass , we note that our infall masses are lower than our outflow masses .         this is contrary to the results of @xcite ; however , their ratio was calculated for the protostellar jet , not the entrained molecular outflow .          this comparison to @xcite suggests that more of the ambient mass is entrained into the large scale molecular outflow ( produced by a protostellar jet ) than falls in onto the forming stars ( i.e. * ? ? ? given the extent of hco@xmath0 gas ( @xmath40 ) in our current maps , this distance would give a linear scale of over 4 pc for a single outflow .     The other authors have suggested a distance to this source of 5.8 kpc ( i.e. * ? ? ?   ) , but given that this source is along a line of sight close to both the galactic plane and galactic center , it is not unreasonable to suggest that this source is an extremely large outflow .    The other authors have suggested a distance to this source of 5.8 kpc ( i.e. * ? ? ?   ).    The other authors have suggested a distance of 5.8 kpc , but given that this source is along a line of sight reasonably close to both the galactic plane and galactic center , it is not unreasonable to suggest that what appears to be an extremely large outflow is instead the super - position of a number of clouds along the line of sight .    The other authors have suggested a distance of 5.8 kpc , however , based on the arguments presented below , we suggest that the gas kinematics and morphology are due to a large outflow the single peak of the optically thin h@xmath1co@xmath0 is at -67 km s@xmath2 as is the minimum of the hco@xmath0 self absorption feature .   The peak of this self - absorption lies directly between the peaks of the red and blue profiles , and is the same as the source rest velocity .   The hco@xmath0 self - absorption feature is the same as the source rest velocity .   The hco@xmath0 self - absorption feature is the same as the source rest velocity , since no other sources in the w31 region have rest velocities similar to the ones seen in the g10.47 region .   The hco@xmath0 self - absorption feature lies directly between the peaks of the red and blue profiles , and is the same as the source rest velocity .  The hco@xmath0 self - absorption feature lies directly between the peaks of the red and blue profiles , and is the same is true for the co isotopologues in this region .    The bima observations of @xcite show one peak in c@xmath41o , while the @xmath1co observations of @xc Our observations of g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , g10.47 , and g10.47 , with large scale , fairly collimated outflow emanating from a cluster of hii regions pose interesting challenges for accretion models . � as stated previously , g10.6 was added to our source list because it was previously known to show evidence for small scale infall , both in molecular gas @xcite and ionized gas @xcite . � these small scale infall signatures appear to be consistent with a single accretion flow which changes from being molecular to ionized as it passes the ionization boundary of the hii region . � while we can not determine the orientation of the large scale infall from our observations , we note that our derived mass infall rate ( 0.03 m@xmath43 yr@xmath2 ) is comparable to , but slightly larger than , that of @xcite ( 0.02 @xmath44 yr@xmath2 ) on infall velocities and shown that the lack of infall signatures in some sources is not due to the signature being beam diluted out of observability at large distances .    we have found that one of our sources which was previously not thought to have an infall signature ( g20.08 ) in fact does appear to have large scale infall motions .    this discovery suggests that more accurate infall results are possible with maps of massive star forming environments than with single pointing observations .     returning to the results of paper 1 , we determined that seven out of the 14 sources with ongoing outflow signatures had infall signatures as well .    we have found that these numbers can now be revised to eight out of 15 outflow sources with infall signatures when g10.6 is added to the source list .    we have also found that we have found that approximately half of the sources with ongoing outflows have infall signatures which we take to trace accretion .    we have also found that, because our sources were selected based on the presence of hii regions , ongoing infall suggests that there is a phase of massive star formation in which the star is still actively accreting , but is also burning hydrogen brightly enough to ionize its surroundings into the central regions of our sample sources , which we would not have been able to determine with our single pointing observations .    we find that when the infall is resolved , the infalling mass is greater than 30 m@xmath43 .    we also find that our derived mass infall rate towards g10.6 is similar to the small scale rate found by @xcite , suggesting that we may be observing the same physical process , but on different spatial scales .    in general    we have found that sio is not very extended ; however , since we mapped these regions in sio , we were able to determine the radius of the emitting region , the mass of shocked gas and how much energy is required to shock the gas surrounding a massive protostar .     we find these energies and luminosities to be similar to the kinetic energy imparted to the outflowing gas and the luminosities of the hii regions themselves .     we also find that the region over which we detect an infall signature and the region in which we detect sio is quite similar , and find that in these regions , the total infall mass is less than the total outflow mass ( m@xmath45 47 + 0.03 & 5.8 & 1.24 & 30 & -10.42 & 2.70 & 12.60 & 23.02 & 184 & 5.8 & 10.3 & 5.1 + g10.6 - 0.4 & 6.0 & 1.14 & 20 & -9.92 & 8.74 & 13.11 & 23.03 & 497 & 9.4 & 27.2 & 21.6 + g19.61 - 0.23 & 4.5 & 0.71 & 45 & -10.32 & 4.57 & 12.83 & 23.15 & 162 & @xmath474.7&@xmath476.8&@xmath472.7 + g20.08 - 0.14 & 4.1 & 0.66 & 4.5 & 0.71 & 45 & -10.32 & 4.57 & 12.83 & 23.15 & 162 & @xmath474.7&@xmath476.8&@xmath472.7 + g20.08 - 0.14 & 4.1 & 0.66 & 30 & -11.06 & 2.68 & 12.60 & 1.02@xmath480.1 & 8.89 & 0.88 & 78.0 & 0.42 + g10.6 - 0.4 & 31.2 & 50 & 28.4 & 13.08 & 1.19@xmath480.1 & 27.34 & 1.42 & 389 & 0.78 + g19.61 - 0.23 & 8.3 & 80 & 14.4 & 12.78 & 1.49@xmath480.6 & @xmath478.5&@xmath470.71&@xmath4760.3&@xmath470.37 + g20.08 - 0.14 & 5.9 & 55 & 9.2 & 12.59 & 1.35@xmath480.3 & 5.51 & 0.60 & 33.0 & 0.09 + g29.967 - 0.02 & 16.5 & 30 & 9.2 & 12.59&&&1.19 & & k3 - 50a & 17.0 & 30 & 13.2 & 12.75&&&@xmath471.36 & & + [ tab : hco_prop ] caselli , p. , hartquist , t.  w. , & havnes , o.  1997 , a&a , 322 , 296 di francesco , j. , johnstone , d. , kirk , h. , mackenzie , t. , & ledwosinska , e.  2008 , , 175 , 277 fuller , g.  a. , williams , s.  j. , & sridharan , t.  k.  2005 , a&a , 442 , 949 gibb , a.  g. , wyrowski , f. , & mundy , l.  g.  2004 , apj , 616 , 301 gregersen , e.  m. , evans , n.  j. , ii , zhou , s. , & choi , m.  1997 , apj , 484 , 256 hunter , t.  r.  1997 , ph.d .  2005 , apj , 678 , 678 , l109 keto , e.  2007 , apj , 616 , 301 gregersen , e.  m. , evans , n. j , 648 , 1079 kroupa , p.  2001 , mnras , 322 , 231 kurtz , s. , cesaroni , r. , churchwell , e. , hofner , p. , & walmsley , c.  m.  2000 , protostars and planets iv , 299 kurtz , s. , churchwell , e. , & wood , d.  o.  s.  1994 , apjs , 91 , 659 mardones , d. , myers , p.  c. , tafalla , m. , wilner , d.  j. , bachiller , r. , & garay , g.  1997 , apj , 489 , 719 mckee , c.  f. , & tan , j.  c.  2003 , , 585 , 850 myers , p.  c. , mardones , d. , tafalla , m. , williams , j.  p. , & wilner , d.  j.  1996 , apjl , 465 , l133 olmi , l. , cesaroni , r. , & wal : 1997 , herbig - haro flows and the birth of stars , 182 , 199 plume , r. , jaffe , d.  t. , evans , n.  j. , ii , martin - pintado , j. , & gomez - gonzalez , j.  1997 , apj , 476 , 730 riddick , f.  c. , roche , p.  f. , & lucas , p.  w.  2007 , , 381 , 1077 rholfs , k. , wilson , t.  l. 2004 , tools of radio astronomy ( 4th ed ;

      "generated": "last decade has witnessed a significant advancement of single molecule manipulation and visualization techniques  @xcite providing access to the distribution of physical properties across many individual molecules and not just average properties as was the case of traditional biochemical techniques .    optical tweezers ( ot ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in particular , enable the study of mechanical properties of proteins such as those in the extracellular matrix , in the cytoskeleton and in the muscle , that _ in vivo _ are exposed to stretching forces .    the mechanical properties of macromolecules obtained in these experiments may be directly connected to corresponding thermodynamical quantities  @xcite with a bit of caution , since mechanical experiments are usually out - of - equilibrium , as discussed in this paper . on the other hand ,    the mechanical properties of biomolecules may be of direct importance for what concerns bendability ( dna ) , translocation of nucleic acids and proteins across cellular membranes , rigidity and elasticity ( structural proteins ) .    in a force - measuring afm experiment ,    the mechanical properties of biomolecules may be of direct importance for what concerns bendability ( dna ) , translocation of nucleic acids and proteins across long protein .    a common strategy proposed in the literature to address these problems is to use an engineered protein composed by several tandem repeats of the same kind of domain .    a typical choice is to use domains belonging to the immunoglobulin  @xcite , fibronectin iii  @xcite or cadherin  @xcite superfamilies , characterized by @xmath0-sandwich structures .    a variety of alpha - helical domains , such as those of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin  @xcite , have also been used .    a typical choice is to use domains belonging to the immunoglobulin  @xcite , characterized by @xmath0-sandwich structures .    a variety of alpha - helical domains , such as those of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin  @xcite , have also been used .    a variety of data about the mechanical properties of modular proteins can be extracted from the force - extension profiles .    the force - extension curves show that the amplitude of each peak , in fact , represents the mechanical stability of the corresponding domain , while the spacing between peaks reflects the length of the unfolded domain and stiffness is determined by the persistence length @xmath1 ( the length scale over which the polymer loses orientation order ) .    in our model , the functional relation between the external force and the fractional extension @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the end - to - end distance and @xmath4 is the contour length ) is approximatly given by the interpolating formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the temperature .    in the fjc model ,    in our model , the polymer is portrayed as a chain of rigid segments linked by frictionless joints so that each segment can point in any direction irrespective of the orientations of the others .    in our model ,    in our model , the polymer is portrayed as a chain of rigid segments linked by frictionless joints so that each segment can point in any direction irrespective of the orientations of the others .     in our model ,    in our model , a measure of the stiffness of the chain is represented by the kuhn segment length @xmath8 ( the average length of the segments ) .    in our model , the .    if we let @xmath10 be a constant pulling force , @xmath10 be a constant pulling force , @xmath12 the number of broken contacts and @xmath13 the length increment per cleaved contact .    if no folding prize is attributed to the molecule in a native - like state , the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath14 and the partition function is @xmath15 notice that this is also the partition function of an ising - like model in one dimension without coupling among spins .     the average end - to - end distance can thus be computed as @xmath16    , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; fjc with @xmath19 , ising with @xmath20 @xmath21 , hook ( harmonic potential ) with @xmath22 . ]    the variation of length @xmath23 versus @xmath10 in the wlc , fjc and our ( ising ) models is shown in figure  [ models ] , where we have adjusted the constant @xmath13 ( corresponding to persistence length @xmath13 ( corresponding to persistence length @xmath1 so to make the curve coincide for small elong 25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see section  [ model ] for the illustration of the model ) .   [ iso ]    the independence assumption is questionable , since all domains are coupled by the presence of the cantilever .    this difference may be explicited by comparying computations  @xcite in which the position of the cantilever is observed ( isometric ) while the force may fluctuate , with computations in which the force is maintained constant ( isotensional ) .    we can obtain exact comparisons of the two different set - up for our model ( see section  [ model ] ) , as shown in figure  [ iso ] .   [ iso ]    it can be noticed that the isotensional model does not show any peaks ( the peaks are here smoothed due to the small length of the single module ) .    moreover , the peaks in the force - extension profile ( fig .  [ figvassalli ] ) are a signature of a first - order transition .    as we shall show in the following , this transition naturally arise in our model due to the long - range coupling ( the folding of @xcite and makarov and coworkers  @xcite performed monte carlo simulations of titin forced unfolding . during these simulations  @xcite showed that a critical value @xmath31 of the number of hydrogen bonds at time @xmath31 , @xmath32 , undergoes a random walk .  @xcite and makarov also showed that a critical value @xmath33 of the number of hydrogen bond does exist , such that when @xmath34 , the domain unfolds very rapidly .  @xcite and makarov also showed that the number of bonds is roughly one , when the force is low enough , whereas for very large pulling rates ( and thus large pulling forces ) , it is likely to be equal to six , recovering the findings by lu and schulten  @xcite .  @xcite and makarov also showed that the accuracy of the model developed by makarov and coworkers , allows quantitative comparisons with experimental data at the expense of very long simulation times and the need to assume the knowledge of the free energy profile .  @xcite , their model is also based on the hypothesis of independence of domains which , however , might be incompatible with the coupling introduced by the cantilever of two different analytic expressions of the force - field inside and outside the native basin .  @xcite , the same purpose can be pursued through a much simpler strategy  @xcite , by rescaling the conformational force when the fraction of native contacts crosses a pre - chosen threshold .  @xcite , this approach appears to be similar to the one employed in our model .  @xcite , the energy function of our model comprises an elastic term and a contact term .  @xcite , the harmonic term accounts for the elasticity of the cantilever , while the protein can be thought of as a soft spring so that its contribution to the elasticity of the system is negligible .  @xcite , the contact term of our energy function , on the other hand , is a stabilizing contribution that the protein receives only when the fraction of intact contacts crosses a threshold .  @xcite , this approach is thus equivalent to a force rescaling occurring whenever the polymer enters the native basin , and the contact term of the energy function appears to be a square well .  @xcite , this approach appears to be similar to the one employed by galzitskaya and finkelstein ( gf )  @xcite .  @xcite paper is as follows . in section  [ model ]  we describe the model and the simulation procefdure ; in section  [ single ] we study the equilbrium behavio r of a single domain ; in section  [ fluctuations ] we investigate the role of fluctuations in the reciprocal influence between successive unfolding events ; in section  [ pulling - rate ] we investigate the dependence of the unfolding force on the pulling rate and we sketch a simple analytic treatment of the unfolding probability in the limit of an extremely high pulling rate ; finally , in section  [ conclusions ] we draw the conclusions of our work .    in our simplified representation   the afm in its simplest arrangement is just a spring ( the cantilever ) whose deflection , and thus the applied force , is measured as a function of its position .    in our simplified representation   the afm in its simplest arrangement is just a spring ( the cantilever ) whose deflection , and thus the applied force , is measured as a function of its position .    in our simplified representation   the system , as shown in figure  [ setup ] , can therefore be modeled as a harmonic spring in series with a protein composed by @xmath37 tandem repeats configuration @xmath48 is modeled by the sum of two contributions : a harmonic term @xmath49 , accounting for the presence of the spring , and the sum over all domains @xmath38 of a term @xmath50 , related to the long - range interactions among the monomers , @xmath51    the harmonic term is expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the harmonic constant .    in our simplified representation    the harmonic term is expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the harmonic constant , if the fraction of intact contacts @xmath54 in a domain @xmath38 is below a given threshold @xmath55 , the domain receives a folding prize @xmath56 proportional to the number of possible contacts .    the interaction term is thus computed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the heaviside step function @xmath59    in summary , the energy of a configuration is just a function of the number of broken contacts in each domain @xmath60^{2 }     -an\\theta(\\theta n - n_{j}),\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 given in terms of the number of possible microscopic configurations containing @xmath63 cleaved contacts .    in real stretching experiments ,    in the case of @xmath63 cleaved contacts , however , the polymer is subjected to a finite pulling velocity , so that the molecule can not be considered in an equilibrium condition . in order to consider this effect , we use monte carlo simulations . for each value of @xmath47 , @xmath7 monte carlo steps are performed , each involving @xmath74 elementary steps .     the elementary step consists in the random choice of a domain and in the attempt to increase or decrease by one the number of contacts with probability equal to the fraction of broken or intact contacts respectively .     the trial move is then accepted or rejected with a probability derived from the heat - bath criterion , @xmath75 where @xmath0 is the inverse temperature .      the average length of the spring @xmath69 , corresponding to the current position @xmath47 is computed averaging over @xmath7 monte carlo steps .       in order to consider this effect , we first analyze the entropic effects related to temperature through \",options=\"header \" , ]     the features of the saw - tooth @xmath76 profile are affected by several simulation parameters . the folding prize @xmath77 is related to the enthalpic component of the free energy and stabilizes the folded conformation of the protein . as a consequence , \u001c when @xmath77 is large , the polymer tends to remain in the compact conformation so as to retain the significant folding prize and the increase in @xmath47 leads to a stretching of the cantilever spring . \u001c only when @xmath69 is very large it becomes enthalpically favourable for the polymer to unfold because the decrease in harmonic energy due to the cantilever relaxation more than compensates the loss of the folding prize . \u001c thus , as @xmath77 is increased , higher and higher values of @xmath69 are required for the elastic energy to compensate the folding prize and the peak of the @xmath76 plot becomes accordingly higher and higher . \u001c in fact , the harmonic constant @xmath53 of the cantilever spring plays a role basically opposite to that of the folding prize . \u001c in fact , when @xmath53 is large , smaller average extensions @xmath pic term of the free energy . 88 , the breakdown of the domain is entropically favoured as it brings the degeneracy closer to its maximum . panel of fig .

[ fig : fluctuations ] indicates that the peaks in the variance peaks are characterized by a high and narrow spike followed by a smoother region that decreases more slowly .  [ fig : fluctuations ] indicates that the shape of the variance peak is related to the regions of the free energy landscape explored by the system during the unfolding transition .  [ fig : fluctuations ] indicates that the spikes in the variance plots ( that are truncated for the sake of graphical clarity ) correspond to the situation with @xmath103 when both wells are explored by the system and the variance @xmath104 is related to the distance between the two wells . on the other hand ,  [ fig : fluctuations ] indicates that the spikes in the smooth regions of the variance plots refer to the case with @xmath105 when the system only explores the unfolded region of the free energy landscape whose width correlates with the variance .  [ fig : fluctuations ] shows that the height of the smooth region of the variance peaks increases with the order of the unfolding event .  [ fig : fluctuations ] shows that the height of the smooth region of the variance peaks increases with the number of contacts broken before each unfolding event is smaller than the maximum number allowed by the loss of the folding prize in the previous domain breakdown .    when @xmath100 , 26 contacts ( a number of the order of @xmath107 ) are broken before the first unfolding event .    this value is consistent with the number of contacts that can be disrupted without loss of the folding prize .     when @xmath91 , after the first collapse event , the number of contacts broken in the simulation rises to 115 , thus determining an increase of the fluctuations and favouring the breakdown of another domain .     this explains why the second peak of the @xmath76 plot is less pronounced than the first one .     the occurrence of the second unfolding determines a further increase of the number of cleaved contacts to 205 .      this results in a easy breakdown of the last domain of the protein and the last peak of the @xmath76 plot is therefore less high than the second one .     this explains why the second peak of the @xmath76 plot is less pronounced than the first one .     this explains why the number of cleaved contacts the fluctuations rapidly become negligible and the heights of the peaks become roughly the same due to the identical energetic features of the domains . computation parameters : @xmath92 ; @xmath93 ; @xmath94 ; @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ; @xmath100 ; @xmath109 . ]    the role of fluctuations in determining the relative heights of the peaks of the @xmath76 plot , and thus the coupling among domains , is confirmed through simulations performed at different temperatures . at very low temperatures , in fact , the entropic term of the free energy becomes negligible and the height of the peaks of the @xmath76 plot only depends on the energetic term . as we are considering a protein composed by identical domains , we expect the @xmath110 peaks to be identical if the temperature is sufficiently low embodiments a consequence of the irreversibility of the stretching process is that the unfolding force depends on the pulling speed .  embodiments actually , if the loading rate @xmath116 ( with @xmath117 being the elastic constant and @xmath118 the pulling velocity ) is sufficiently small , thermal fluctuations are allowed enough time to overcome the energy barrier and the unfolding force will be low .  embodiments several experimental works  @xcite reported a logarithmic dependence of the unfolding force on the loading rate in the case where a single energy barrier is present along the reaction path .  embodiments the analytic expression of the relation between force and loading rate was derived  @xcite within the frame of kramer s theory for a simple two - state model , by assuming that the external force reduces the height of the energy barrier , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the Boltzmann constant , @xmath7 is the absolute temperature , @xmath121 is the distance between the minimum corresponding to the folded state and the activation barrier of the energy landscape , @xmath118 is the pulling speed , @xmath118 is the pulling speed , @xmath53 is the cantilever harmonic constant and @xmath122 is the spontaneous unfolding rate . , the equilibrium profile is smoother than that in figure  [ fig : fluctuations ] , figure  [ temperature ] and preceding ones . ]    we limit here to a preliminary illustration of a series of monte carlo simulations with different number of steps @xmath7 considering the pulling speed as being proportional to @xmath126 .     this is a preliminary illustration of a series of monte carlo simulations with different number of steps @xmath7 considering the pulling speed as being proportional to @xmath126 .     this is a preliminary illustration and a more detailed analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .     the figure  [ dynamics ] shows that , as the number of monte - carlo ( mc ) steps is increased , the @xmath127 plot becomes closer and closer to the profile yielded by the equilibrium simulation . @xmath135 , the coefficients of the linear equation can be equated to the corresponding parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 of the regression line @xmath138 , so as to build the following system of equations : @xmath139    from the first equation of the system it is possible to compute the width of the activation barrier @xmath140 ; this value can then be substituted into the second equation so as to determine @xmath141 . the spontaneous unfolding rate @xmath122 , on turn ,    is related to the height of the activation barrier for the unfolding process , @xmath142 where @xmath143 , as explained by kramer s theory , is the reciprocal of a diffusive relaxation time .    this simple computation shows how stretching experiments and simulations provide easy access to important features of the free energy landscape . in a forthcoming paper  [ typical - plot ] , we aim at investigating the relations relating the barrier width @xmath121 and the spontaneous unfolding rate @xmath122 with molecular properties such as the folding prize @xmath77 , the threshold @xmath55 , the number @xmath36 and the length @xmath37 of the domains .    in a forthcoming paper the problem thus arises to identify the factors affecting the probability of this crucial step . more specifically , of mc simulations differing from a reference one just for a parameter ( figure  [ height ] ) . the key parameters characterizing the reference simulations are : @xmath155 , @xmath157 , @xmath125 , @xmath84 . in agreement with the analytic computation ,         the simulations show that an increase in the number of monte carlo steps ( @xmath158 ) , an increase in temperature ( @xmath159 ) , a decrease of the folding prize ( @xmath160 ) , and an increase of the spring constant ( @xmath161 ) , all result in an increase of the unfolding probability , thus reducing the height of the peak in the @xmath127-plot .       in our study , we developed an extremely simplified model of polymer stretching in which the molecule is portrayed as a series of modules , represented as an array of contacts , and a harmonic spring ( the cantilever ) .      in our model , the chemical interactions stabilizing the native conformation are simply modeled as a folding prize gained by domains where the fraction of folded monomers is above a pre - chosen threshold .       in our study , our model .    in particular , our model correctly reproduces the typical saw - tooth pattern with peaks characterized by a height dependent on the folding prize , the temperature and the pulling velocity .    in our study , a particular attention was paid to the relation between the heights of successive peaks in the force - extension plot .    in our study , this point is quite intriguing as experimental data show that the force of unfolding tends to increase with each unfolding event , suggesting that the protein domains unfold following an increasing order of mechanical stability  @xcite .    in our study , a possible explanation suggested by the literature is that the domains of the engineered modular constructs used in afm experiments are not identical but just structurally similar  @xcite .    in our study , it was found that this argument may be correct in the case of real proteins where the differences in mechanical stability of the tandem repeats of the construct may arise from their different position in the tridimensional structure of the molecule . in a computer simulation , however , the domains are all perfectly identical and the explanation for the staircase pattern of unfolding peaks must be sought elsewhere .    in our study , our model correctly reproduces the typical saw - tooth pattern with peaks characterized by a of the force peaks and in their earlier occurrence during stretching .    an interesting feature of afm stretching experiments is that the mean unfolding force is a logarithmic function of the pulling rate .    this pattern reflects the role of thermal fluctuations : if the pulling speed is sufficiently low , then there will be enough time for thermal fluctuations to drive the polymer over the free energy barrier and the unfolding force will be accordingly low .    the ability to reproduce this pattern constitutes a benchmark for any stretching model . in order to test our model    we performed a series of monte carlo simulations with different numbers @xmath7 of mc - steps and regarding the pulling velocity to be proportional to @xmath126 .    our toy - model , despite its extreme simplicity , correctly reproduced the linear dependence of the mean unfolding force on the logarithm of the pulling rate .    in summary ,    our simple model including harmonic and long - range energy contributions , is not only capable of reproducing the force - extension saw - tooth pattern , but it also yields force spectra displaying the correct logarithmic dependence of @xmath134 on @xmath162 reported in experimental works .    in summary .w.s . ,    steward a. , geierhaas c.d . , williams p.m. , paci e. and clarke j.

The details of the model can be found in @xcite .      to understand how a population of planetary - mass bodies that form in the outer parts of protostellar discs via disc fragmentation ,     to understand how planetary - mass bodies that form in the outer parts of protostellar discs are perturbed by an outer stellar companion , we run a monte carlo - type simulation in which we randomly choose the outer planet to have a semi - major axis between @xmath4 and @xmath7 au , and to have an eccentricity that is initially small ( drawn from the positive side of a gaussian distribution with a half - width of @xmath8 ) .     We do nt actually have a good sense of the initial properties for such a population of planets .     we could have selected the semi - major axis randomly in @xmath9 , but that the range is quite small ( @xmath10 au ) probably means that this would nt make much difference , which is confirmed by a simple check of our results . also , the only simulations to consider this @xcite suggests that randomly in @xmath11 may be the planetary system .    we , therefore , assume that there is a companion with a mass of @xmath16 m@xmath14 and with a semi - major axis , chosen randomly in log @xmath11 , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 au @xcite .     we , therefore , assume that there is a binary system , chosen randomly in log @xmath11 , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 au @xcite .     we , therefore , assume that both radial velocity and transit exoplanet searches tend to remove binary systems from their catalogs .     we , therefore , these tend to be systems where the separation is smaller than we ve assumed here @xcite and so this should not bias our results .     we also assume that the companion s eccentricity is chosen randomly to be between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , although we impose stability criteria @xcite that ensure that the triple system is long - term stable and that the quadrupole and octupole terms in the secular equations dominate ( see @xcite for details ) .     we could choose to vary the mass of this outer companion , , @xmath27 is tidally destroyed . companions to solar - type stars are quite common , with 30 - 40% having stellar , or sub - stellar , companions @xcite with semi - major axes between @xmath33 and @xmath34 au . ㅋ we ve assumed that these companions have semi -

and survives - inside @xmath37 au , would then suggest that 1 - 1.5 % of all solar - type stars could have such close - in planets if all such stars form planetary - mass companions beyond @xmath4 au via disc fragmentation . ㅋ however , we ve only presented results from a single set of parameters here . ㅋ however , we have run some tests with different @xmath38 and @xmath39 values and the results are broadly similar . ㅋ for very large values of @x for those without a mass estimate -

hot jupiters @xcite . � what it shows is that proto - hot jupiters are those gas - giant planets that are found on the high - eccentricity boundary , beyond which planets would typically be tidally destroyed , and that will ultimately tidally evolve to become ` hot ' jupiters . � this is quite useful in that it constrains the region of @xmath48 space where we would find such planets , if they do indeed exist . � again , we ve only presented results from a single set of parameters . � we ve used a relatively low @xmath38 value and we find that higher @xmath38 values tend to result in proto - hot jupiters having larger eccentricities , for a given final semi - major axis . � in fact , for sufficiently large @xmath38 values ( @xmath40 ) the proto - hot j . , most stars have gas giants orbiting beyond @xmath4 au ) then @xmath49 % of stars could have close - in exoplanets that were scattered in from these large initial radii . � however , figure [ fig : aplaneouter1 ] shows that these would have to be either ` hot ' jupiters , or be proto - hot jupiters undergoing high - eccentricity tidal migration . � currently , only about @xmath32 % of sun - like stars have such planets @xcite and , so , if planet formation via disc fragmentation is common , this scattering scenario could explain almost all the known ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters . � however , one can also largely explain the ` hot ' jupiters and proto - hot jupiters through a combination of disc migration and scattering ( both from other planets and from stellar and sub - stellar companions ) of planets that initially form at modest semi - major axes ( inside @xmath50 au ) @xcite . � however , we reran our simulations with the only change being that the planets were randomly distributed between @xmath51 and @xmath52 au , rather than between @xmath4 and @ upiters or proto - hot jupiters via this mechanism alone . moreover , when @xcite analyzed the distribution of transit durations , and therefore eccentricities , among ` hot ' jupiters found by _ kepler _ ߟ , they found that eccentric proto - hot jupiters are extremely rare compared to ` hot ' jupiters , indicating that the majority of the observed ` hot ' jupiters likely arrive by disc migration and not by high eccentricity scattering from the snow - line or beyond . ߟ , therefore , that closer stellar companions , other planetary companions , and disc migration could also play a role in forming such planets , suggests that such mechanisms are sufficient to explain the observed population , and that scattering planets from beyond @xmath4 au is unlikely to play a significant role . ߟ , however , it is important to further investigate this is to consider the properties of the known exoplanets that lie within the region to which these outer planets could be scattered . ߟ , therefore , we assume that planets scattered from beyond @xmath4 au can only become either ` hot ' jupiters , or proto - hot jupiters . ߟ , therefore , we assume a large initial semi - major axis . � figure [ fig : exomasshist ] shows the mass distribution for the known exoplanets with masses above @xmath32 jupiter mass that exist to the left of the dashed - line in figure [ fig : aplaneouter1 ] ( solid line ) and also shows the mass distribution of all known exoplanets with masses above @xmath32 jupiter mass . � both distributions are very similar and is therefore consistent with most ` hot ' jupiters and proto - hot jupiters coming from the main exoplanet population . � additionally , most of the planets have masses below @xmath51 jupiter masses , and more than @xmath57% have masses below 3 jupiter masses . � it has been suggested @xcite that the initial mass of planets that form via disc fragmentation will typically exceed @xmath58 jupiter masses . even after tidal downsizing � , the vast majority of objects still have masses above 5 jupiter masses @xcite and , if there is any external irradiation , the initial mass increases @xcite . � additionally , most of the planets have masses below @xmath51 jupiter masses , and more than @x 45 , the fraction that survive inside @xmath32 au drops from @xmath2 % to @xmath60 % , and the region of @xmath48 space to which they are scattered remains unchanged . therefore , even if our mass distribution is not quite representative of what would be expected for objects forming at large radii via disc fragmentation , this would nt change our results significantly .     it is also generally recognised that the host stars of gas giants tend to be metal - rich compared to a typical sample of similar stars @xcite .    this is thought to indicate that gas giant planets are more likely to form in discs that are enhanced in solids and is regarded as consistent with the standard core accretion scenario @xcite .    it is also thought that disc fragmentation would not seem to require this enhancement and , if anything , it may even be more effective in systems that are metal poor @xcite since such discs can cool more efficiently than discs that are enhanced in solids .     it has been suggested , however , that there may be a similar metallicity dependence for planets that form via gravitational instability , undergo pebble accretion , and then migrate rapidly to the inner disc @xcite . that the distributions are very similar and that - like the bulk exoplanet population - ` hot ' jupiters and proto - hot jupiters tend to be found around metal - rich stars . again , this is consistent with such planets being scattered , or migrated , from the bulk exoplanet population , rather than from radii beyond @xmath4 au .    to further quantify Â if the ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters could have originated from the bulk exoplanet population , we carried out kolmogorov - smirnoff tests on the metallicity and mass distributions . Â similarly , the ks test of the metallicity distribution returns a probability of @xmath63 , indicating that we ca nt rule out that ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters are drawn from the same distribution as the bulk exoplanet population ( dashed - line in figure [ fig : exomasshist ] ) . Â similarly , the ks test of the metallicity distribution returns a probability of @xmath64 , again indicating that we ca nt rule out that the two populations are drawn from the same distribution as the bulk exoplanet population ( dashed - also suggest that ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters are more likely to have come from the main exoplanet population , than from a population of planetary - mass bodies that formed via disc fragmentation at large orbital radii .     and possibly one of the more interesting objects in the context of what we re considering here is kelt-1b @xcite .     it is a brown dwarf , rather than a planetary - mass , companion to a @xmath65 solar - mass star on an orbit with a semi - major axis of @xmath66 au , and an eccentricity of @xmath67 .     it has a mass of @xmath68 jupiter masses and so is more consistent with what might be expected for objects that form via disc fragmentation at large radii @xcite .     we did nt directly address this system , as it is beyond what we can consider here , but we did repeat our simulations with the only changes being that we simulated 2500 systems ( rather than 5000 ) and assumed that the outer non - stellar object had a mass of @xmath69 jupiter masses .    as with our earlier simulations , a large fraction of the objects upiters or proto - hot jupiters , beyond which they would be tidally destroyed . ccording the position of kelt-1b is indicated at @xmath66 au and @xmath67 . as is clear ccording the position of kelt-1b , it is possible for a system such as kelt-1b to form via scattering from a large initial radius . ccording as already mentioned , about @xmath32 % of sun - like stars have a ` hot ' jupiter or a proto - hot jupiter @xcite . ccording if we consider the known exoplanets with mass estimates , there are 127 with masses above @xmath32 jupiter mass and that are either ` hot ' jupiters or proto - hot jupiters ( i.e. , lie to the left of the dashed line in figure [ fig : aplaneouter1 ] ) . if we also consider those without mass estimates , but with radii above 1 jupiter radius , it increases to 282 . ccording kelt-1b is one of the few brown dwarf companions that have orbital properties similar to that of a typical ` hot ' jupiters . the only other known one is corot- words , maybe @xmath42% of the known ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters originated from beyond @xmath3 au . however , as mentioned earlier , all the known ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters could have such origins if just over half of solar - like stars have a population of outer planetary companions . therefore , if only @xmath42% of known ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters have such an origin , less than @xmath42% of sun - like stars can have planetary , or brown dwarf , mass companions at large radii . ㅋ as we ve shown above , planetary - mass bodies scattered from large initial radii ( @xmath1 au ) can only be found as ` hot ' jupiters or proto - hot jupiters . ㅋ we ve also shown that the properties of the known exoplanets in those regions are very similar to that of the bulk exoplanet population , suggesting that very few - if any - were scattered from beyond @xmath4 au . a simplistic analysis based on the existence of a kelt-1b , a brown dwarf with orbital properties similar to that of ` hot ' jupiters , detection methods uniquely probes planets at large radii ( @xmath7750 au ) . to date , @xmath7820 wide exoplanet or very - low - mass objects ( @xmath7625 m@xmath79 ) have been discovered ( @xcite , among others ) . in the last decade , numerous 8 m telescope + coronagraph surveys have searched for planetary - mass bodies around young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , in order to detect new companions and also to determine the frequency of such wide companions . ccording however , although individual surveys tend to only cover 80 - 100 stars , these surveys have - overall - now observed a sample of @xmath78500 stars . ccording they have unearthed few new planets and most have yielded null planet detections , leading to the unambiguous result that planetary - mass bodies are rare at large radii ( @xmath7750 au ) . for instance , biller et al . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2013 ) find , from a bayesian analysis of a null planet detection from 78 young moving group stars observed with the gemini nici planet - finder , that the frequency of 1 - 20 m@xmath45 companions at semi - major axes from 10 - 150 au is @ 100 au . � they argue that this suggests that most wide companions formed through disc fragmentation rather than through core accretion . � however , whichever formation mechanism is responsible for their formation , wide giant - exoplanet companions are quite rare . � further analysis , however , suggests that the few known wide companions are indeed more likely to have been formed by disc fragmentation , than via core accretion . � biller et al . � 2013 marginalize over a wide range of potential planetary distributions and brandt et al . � 2014b explicitly fit power - laws unconnected to radial velocity studies . � however , most statistical treatments of directly imaged planetary companion distributions adopt fixed power - law distributions in semi - major axis and planet mass drawn from radial velocity planet studies ( e.g. cumming et al . � 2008 ) and extend these proscriptions to separations appropriate for directly imaged planets ( e.g. @xmath7710 au ) . � however , most statistical treatments of directly imaged planetary companion distributions adopt fixed power - laws distributions in semi - major axis and planet mass drawn from radial velocity planet studies ( e.g. cumming et al . � 2008 ) and extend these proscriptions to separ , the direct imaging surveys are also consistent with the results of the simulations presented here : planetary - mass bodies at large radii are rare and , therefore , disc fragmentation rarely forms such objects .     of course , we conclude that it is possible that a few percent of stars host such companions , but that is consistent with the suggestion in section 3.2 , that at most a few of the known ` hot ' jupiters and proto - hot jupiters could have been scattered from a large initial radius .     of course , in this study we have aimed to investigate if we can identify a population , from within the known exoplanet population , that may have originated from large initial radii ( @xmath1 au ) . given that a reasonable fraction ( @xmath81 % ) of solar - like stars have stellar companions , a population of planetary - mass companions beyond @xmath4 au - if it does exist - should be susceptible to scattering via perturbations from these even more distant stellar companions .     of course , the analysis here suggests that if any such planets are scattered to closer orbits they should be found as ` hot ' jupiters ( @xmath47 au and @xmath a substantial population of planetary - mass bodies at large radii around solar - like stars and , consequently , that disc fragmentation rarely forms such objects .    of course , there are a number of caveats to the above .    of course , we only presented results from a single set of parameters in our simulations , but most were chosen to be conservative .    of course , for example , the stellar wind parameter was chosen to spin the star down slightly more than may be reasonable .     of course , a weaker wind would remove less angular momentum , slow the tidal evolution of the planet , and allow a larger fraction to survive .     of course , the tidal quality factors were also chosen to be on the low side of the range .    of course , the additional tests suggest that larger @xmath38 values would nt change the fraction surviving inside @xmath32 au substantially and would tend to move the proto - hot jupiters to even larger eccentricities than considered here . therefore ,    of course , if planetary - mass objects at large radii were common , they could explain a large fraction of the known ` hot ' jupiters and proto - hot jupiters . large initial orbital radius .     additionally , kelt1-b is one of only a small number of known brown - dwarf mass objects that lie in the region of parameter space to which we d expect outer objects to be scattered .     additionally , even if kelt-1b is an example of an object scattered from beyond @xmath4 au , it would still be consistent with such objects being rare and , hence , that disc fragmentation rarely operates .     additionally , studies of self - gravitating disc evolution @xcite do , however , suggest that any disc with an initial outer radius that extends beyond @xmath3 au should be susceptible to fragmentation and , consequently , the formation of planetary or brown dwarf - mass objects .     that disc fragmentation seems unlikely , may suggest that discs with such large initial radii are rare , or that external irradiation is able to stabilise such discs against fragmentation @xcite .     there are indeed observations @xcite suggesting that discs around in very young class 0 protostellar systems do tend to be compact , with outer radii inside @xmath4 au .     if so , then by the time such discs have expanded to larger radii , there may be insufficient mass for them to be susceptible This , however , could also remove objects that survive at large radii @xcite . � this , however , would need to be very efficient if it were to reduce an initially large population of outer planetary - mass bodies , to one more consistent with the results presented here . � it is possible , therefore , that the results here have implications for planet formation , suggesting that most known exoplanets formed via core accretion , and for star formation itself , suggesting - for example - that discs around very young stars are typically compact , with initial outer radii inside the radius where disc fragmentation becomes viable , or that magnetic fields and external irradiation can stabilise radially extended discs against fragmentation . � the author acknowledges very useful discussions with adrian barker , gordon ogilvie , phil armitage and douglas heggie . � kr gratefully acknowledges support from stfc grant st / m001229/1 . � kr gratefully acknowledges support from the european union seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 -

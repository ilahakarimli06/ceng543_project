known that uniformly convex mappings are uniformly bounded , and on the other hand it is known that they do not converge to uniformly convex functions . however , this is not the only case ; it is also known that some mappings converge to a uniformly convex function faster than others , for example , if the space is uniformly @x gaussian and if all mappings have the same fixed point . as a result ,<n> we prove that the cyclic projection method for a finite number of sets is asymptotically regular in spaces of curvature bounded above . <n> let @xmath0 be a set in a cat@xmath1 space .<n> we show that the picard iteration of the mapping @xcite , which is obtained by repeated application of the cyclic method to a fixed starting point , is asymptotically regular . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain that the sequence of fixed points obtained by the cyclic projected method for the mapping , for a given number of starting points , has asymptotically the same rate of convergence as the sequence obtained by picard iterations . in this paper , we are interested in the following question : what is the number of iterations required to asymptotically generate a sequence of sets ? <n> the answer to this question is well - known in the field of geometric combinatorics . for each fixed point in a space of euclidean cardinality , there is an iterative method , the so - called _ picard _ iteration , that is used to generate a new set . the method is based on the following statement : _ given any starting point in the space @x we prove a quadratic rate of asymptotic regularity for the sequence generated by the alternating projection method for two sets in the context of @xmath0-uniformly convex cat@xmath1 spaces .<n> moreover , we extend this result to more general mappings , namely firmly nonexpansive ones . <n> this paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic regularity of sequences of nonempty convex sets in convex spaces , a topic that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in this context ,<n> a sequence of sets is said to be asymptotically regular if it is generated by some sequence of mappings with the property that for every nonempty point in the set , there is a mapping with asymptotic regularity equal to that point . for a class of convex sets<n> that includes all closed and convex sets , and for a large class of parameter values , the class of all - convex sets is the convexity class of the space under consideration . as such , asymptotic regularity is a fundamental property of convexity classes , which has been intensively studied in the recent years , both theoretically and experimentally @x<n> . however , it is still an open question whether asymptotic regularity can be obtained in this note , we give a rate of convergence , defined by @xmath0 , towards the rate of asymptotic regularity for a family of finitely generated nonexpansive mappings of the complex plane .<n> we also give rates of convergence towards the same regularity for another family of such mappings . <n> this note is a continuation of the paper @xcite . in this paper ,<n> we are interested in the convergence towards a given rate of exponential convergence ( relc ) of a large class of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde ) . the nonlinear pde is defined as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term , and is defined on the real line , with the coefficients of the linear term depending on the position of the pde in the space of real numbers . here<n> , the nonlinearity is defined by a non - linear mapping of the reals , which is a function of the position and the linearity of the nonlinear terms in the mapping . as such , in the nonlinear case , it is not possible to define the nonlinear term as a linear combination of the two nonlinear terms . on the other hand , for the linear pde we prove a rate of asymptotic regularity for the fixed point set of the composition of two asymptotically regular mappings defined by @xmath0 , where the composition is a cat@xmath1 space .<n> we also prove an asymptotic regularity result for two mappings that satisfy and for which the set of fixed points is nonempty . <n> asymptotic regularity is one of the most important results in the theory of high - dimensional mappings @xcite . in this paper<n> , we consider asymptotically regularity for mappings of high dimensional spaces . to do this ,<n> we first consider the following problem : given a high dimensional space , what is the rate of convergence of its mappings towards a particular fixed point ?<n> this is a question that has been studied in many different contexts , ranging from the study of asymptotic properties of hilbert spaces to the analysis of spectral theory . for this purpose , in the first part of this paper we will review some results that have been obtained in this direction and then we will present some new results . we show that there are cat@xmath0 inequalities for which @xmath1 is unbounded .<n> we apply this result to the minimization of the sum of the square - root of the distance between two points on the real line . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of boundedness properties of hilbert spaces has a long history . in particular , it is well - known that the hilbert space is bounded if and only if it is free of singularities . on the other hand ,<n> unboundedness properties have been studied only in a few special cases , such as the case @xcite , when the space is riemannian , or in the case when it is a compact hyperbolic space , called a cat@ xor space ( see e.g. [ eq : hilbert - xor - space ] in the introduction ) . for instance , the case of the cat - path or the path of the radiation can be shown to be bounded , but not necessarily unbounded , if the corresponding hilbert path is not compact . moreover , for the special case of a cat , there is no bound on the dimension of the space . we show that if @xmath0 is a non - selfadjoint cat@xmath1 space , then the set of all bounded solutions to the minimization problem , which was recently considered in hilbert spaces , can be expanded by a product of nonzero resolvents .<n> we apply this result to the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a minimization problem which was considered in cat@ xy @xcite and was recently taken up in the setting of cat@xxz spaces @x<n> .

particle being treated as relativistic degrees of freedom . with the advent of quantum mechanics , however , it has become possible to use nuclear mean - we show that the @xmath0 chiral transformation can be used to solve the schrdinger equation for ultrarelativistic particles in an arbitrary potential , even if the particles are not relativistic .<n> it is also shown that this transformation does not change the equations of motion , the energy of their solutions is not changed . <n> pacs number(s ) : 03.65.ge , 11.10.lm , 12.20.ds the study of the properties of relativistic particles is one of the main topics in relativistic quantum mechanics . in the case of massless particles ,<n> such as electrons and quarks , it is well known that the dirac equation can be reformulated in terms of the massless dirac hamiltonian @xcite . for particles with more than two masses , however , and for potentials that are more complicated than the harmonic oscillator , there is a possibility of another kind of relativistic mechanics , one in which the particle is described by a relativistic equation of motion ( relm ) of the form @x<n> , where the mass and the charge of the particle are treated as arbitrary constants . as a consequence , in the relativistic we study the solutions of 1 + 1 dirac equation with a potential with the most general lorentz structure which leads to harmonic oscillator potentials in the second -

state solutions in the nonrelativistic limit , meaning in this case we have an intrinsic relativistic problem . <n> we analyzed in great detail , by use of a graphical procedure , the solutions , of the transcendental eigenvalue equation , for all signs of the potentials and for both particle and antiparticle states . in particular , there is an increasing interest in studying the behavior of antinucleon in nuclei , in particular how well pseudospin and spin symmetries hold for nucleons and anti nucleons respectively . fermion and antifermion bounded solutions simultaneously or just one of these kind of solutions are studied . we established a connection to 3 + 1 dimensional relativistic oscillator harmonic potentials applied to nuclei , where there is a relation between those coefficients and concluded that , for a sufficiently strong @xmath0 potential , both kinds of solutions ( nucleons and antinucleons ) can coexist . also , most of the features of the 1 + 1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3 +1 relativistic harmonic oscillator . in the context of a study of the symmetries of a 3-dimensional relativistic oscillator , ginocchio already showed in connection to spin and isospin symmetry the existence of the so - called pseudoscalar solutions @xcite .<n> the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations were used to obtain the solutions for the so called pseudospin ( _ i.e. _ , pseudospin _ and spin _ symmetry _ for any potential ) for the case of massless fermions and zero pseudoscalalar potential . for zero potentials ,<n> both kinds ( fermionic and antisymmetric ) solutions have the same spectrum . in the context of a study of the symmetries of a 3-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator , ginocchio already showed that one can transform the generators of the su(2 ) spin symmetry into the pseudospin generators by a @xmath0 transformation @xcite .<n> we show that this transformation enables us to relate the spin and pseudospin problems for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , also to conclude that the two energy spectra are the same .",

dependent potential , and the other is a force due to the the tidal field of an object moving in a gravitational field is known to affect its trajectory .<n> however , the accuracy with which such tidal effects can be computed is limited by the accuracy of the trajectory over which they are applied . here<n> we show that the accuracy can be greatly improved by introducing a time - dependent tidal field , which can be calculated from the position of the osculating elements . as an example<n> , we consider the trajectory of a photon propagating through a tidal field generated by two bodies , one of which is bound to the photon and the other is at rest in the gravitational field . using a linear approximation for the perturbing force ,<n> we compute the trajectory , and show that it can be well approximated by a superposition of _ static _ and _ dynamic _ tidal fields . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + -

dependent schrdinger equation ( tde ) , which describes the evolution of the quantum state in terms of conserved quantities . in this context<n> , we show that the hamiltonian evolution equation can be reduced to a simpler delta - gauss equation . <n> quantum evolution is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics , and has been the subject of intensive study since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . over the last two decades ,<n> quantum field theory has provided a powerful framework for the study of quantum evolution , particularly in the context of unitary transformations . however , the field has come to be known as non - unitary evolution since the seminal work of feynman and einstein @xmath0 . despite the fact that the field - theoretic approach to quantum evolution has been extensively developed , it has not yet been possible to completely decouple the quantum - field - theory from the classical world . to this end , a number of methods have been developed and applied to decouple quantum fields from their environment . among these<n> are the glauber we consider paths of light in three - dimensional spacetimes with a main body interacting with a weak gravitational field .<n> the main body is assumed to be at rest in the equatorial plane , while the other two bodies move with constant speed along null geodesics in the plane of the weak field , perpendicular to it . for photons with large impact parameters , we find that the path is deflected by the second body ; this deflection depends explicitly on the angular momentum of the photon . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the deflection of light by bodies moving with constant velocity has a long history @xcite . in the early days of quantum mechanics ,<n> einstein predicted that light deflection by a point mass would be _ unobservable _ ; today , this prediction is one of the most important achievements of quantum theory . despite the fact that einstein s theory is based on geodesics , it is generally believed that geodesics are _ not _ appropriate for describing the motion of a body in a gravitational field due to the lack of symmetries in the geometry of the gravitational field around the body . on the other hand , in recent years<n> , gravitational deflection of light rays by bodies moving in the line of sight to a distant binary system is calculated .<n> it is shown that the total deflection angle of a light ray passing near a binary system can be either positive or negative , depending on the inclination of the binary system . in particular , for edge - on binaries , the second body gives the maximum possible deflection . <n> [ firstpage ] binaries : close gravitational lensing : non - thermal stars : individual : @xmath0 gemings : general binaries ( spectroscopic ) : spectroscopic gravitational waves ( gws ) light <n> rays : binaries gravitational waves : stars the orbital motion of a body in a gravitational field is described by the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) field equations @xcite . for a body moving in an external field ,<n> the field equations can be reduced to the schwarzschild equations in the equatorial plane , where the initial position and orbital elements of the body are fixed . as a result<n> , one obtains the schrdinger equations ( sde ) in the plane of geodesics in the field of a parent body , and the equations we study the propagation of a particle path in three - dimensional space under the influence of a second body .<n> it is shown that the path depends on the deflection of the path by the second body and on the total @xmath0 in the direction perpendicular to the path . <n> pacs number(s ) : 03.30.+p , 42.50.ct , 42.65.ky one of the most important problems in the field of quantum optics is the problem of propagation of the quantum state @xcite . in quantum mechanics ,<n> the path is given by the solution of the schrdinger equation , however , in quantum optics , one has to deal with two bodies : one is the initial particle and the other is the final particle ; in general , two bodies can influence each other , but only one body can change the path completely . as a result , the path can not be described by a single particle trajectory ; one can describe it by the trajectories of a collection of particles , called osculating elements , which are the elements of the particle s motion under the action of other particles . here<n> , we show that the osc in this work , we applied the osculating elements formalism to the computation of photons paths evolutions in the schwarzchild spacetime , as well as the tidal geometry around a black hole in reducing a photon - binary problem to an effective two body problem .<n> this work shows how a companion star can affect the curvature of a light ray brought about by the main lens . it is known that edge - on binaries deflect the light more than others . in this paper ,<n> we considered aphoton in the gravitational field of a binary system and found the form of trajectories invoking the weak field and slow motion approximations . for particles moving on timelike bound orbits , it is believed that there is a secular change in path , @xmath0 , when perturbing forces include a dissipative part ; however , there is no change in the values of the principal elements in these limits . <n> 3d7 ] ] it is well known that a star surrounded by another body can have a strong influence on the path of a particle in its gravitational field @xcite . also , the deflection of light rays coming from other bodies is much larger than that due to the within the osculating elements formalism in the schwarzchild spacetime , the path of a photon passing by a spherical gravitating body , like the main lens , is modified by secular changes due to the presence of a companion body .<n> the magnitude of these secular changes depends on the position of the companion body with respect to the right distance and the orbital phase of the light ray . for edge - on binaries ,<n> deflections of order @xmath0 can be produced , if the companion is at a right orbital phase and right distance from the light path . <n> this work illustrates the application of the ppn formalism to the computation of paths of photons in the field of a gravitating body with a companion , as well as the tidal geometry around a black hole . as an example<n> , it is shown how the deflection of a light ray due to a companion star can be computed for a typical photon - binary system ; this criterion is further developed in this paper . the importance of determining such corrections to null geodesics can be understood when astrometric information is read off the light paths at a high precision level ; such astronomy can be used to constrain the post -

stokes equations are one of the most widely used mathematical models in fluid dynamics to describe the transport of particles and heat in a wide range of situations .<n> it is well - known that in the case of a confining hydrodynamic flow , the lagrangian invariants @xmath0 , of the restricted euler equation , and of the pressure hessian , enter as quantities that control the time evolution of the joint probability density . in this article<n> , we show that the probability currents associated with these quantities can be written in terms of conditional averages of the probability density itself , which can be decomposed into the so - called probability current associated with the pressurehessian . using data from direct numerical simulation ,<n> we demonstrate that this probability current can be related to the diffusivity of the fluid , to the pressure and to the euler term entering the equation of state . <n> the equations of motion of a fluid can be cast into the form of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , each of which is governed by an invariant of the particle distribution @xcite . for a fluid confined to a fixed geometry and subject to an external force , we investigate the dynamics of velocity gradients in an incompressible navier - stokes flow in two dimensions .<n> the velocity field is obtained by solving the time - dependent euler equation in the mean - field approximation , using the kolmogorov - smoluchowski equation as a boundary condition . in a series of papers @xcite ,<n> we have studied the time evolution of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the velocity gradient along a lagrangian trajectory in two - dimensional stationary flows . here , we extend that work to a three - dimensional flow , in order to investigate the effect of the boundary conditions on the pdf of the flow . <n> the study of stationary flows in hydrodynamics has been a subject of intense research during the past decades , both because of the importance of the problem in various fields , such as fluid dynamics , oceanography , and biology , as well as because of its possible applications , e.g. in medicine , for the treatment of cancer cells . the main focus of the research in that field has been on the development of theoretical and numerical tools to study hydrodynamics , with the aim of finding , among other things we study the effect of anisotropic pressure hessian on the velocity field of a particle diffusing in three - dimensional space .<n> we show that the velocity @xmath0 has a well - defined limit , as a function of the anisotropy parameter , and that the full probability current is divergence free , in order to ensure stationary statistics . in the limit<n> when the velocity vanishes along the vieillefosse line , we recover the well - known result that the probability distribution is gaussian and homogeneous , isotropic and incompressible , having a correlation structure consistent with k41 scalings . <n> the study of the dynamics of complex systems is one of the major challenges of modern theoretical physics , with a wide range of applications ranging from fluid mechanics , turbulence , shock waves , chemical reactions , to high energy physics @xcite . among them ,<n> the problem of particle diffusion in space has attracted a lot of attention during the last few years , due to its relevance to the understanding of transport phenomena in complex media , such as fluids , gases , alloys , semiconductors , polymers , emulsions , etc . a large body of work we study the statistical properties of the probability current associated with the pressure hessian in three - dimensional turbulence .<n> we show that this probability current can be attributed to gaussian statistics and that it can be used to distinguish between different representations of turbulence , such as velocity fields , velocity increments , vorticity gradients and pressure gradients . in particular , we find that the part of the pressure current that is not attributed to gaussianity is not linked to turbulence but rather to the statistics of the velocity field . <n> the study of statistical properties in turbulent flows has a long history , going back to the work of kolmogorov in the 1950s @xcite . since then , statistical mechanics has played an important role in turbulence studies , both for theoretical and for experimental reasons , from the analysis of particle trajectories in turbulent flow to the description of intermittency in hydrodynamics . despite this long history<n> , there is no consensus on the most appropriate representation of turbulence in terms of statistical mechanics , despite the fact that a number of different approaches have been proposed . among these , the most commonly used representation is that of a velocity field @xmath0 , where the velocity is in this work , we investigate the effect of a gaussian velocity field and its associated pressure field on the probability current in dissipative and enstrophy production dominated turbulence .<n> we find that the pressure from the gauss field does not make difference between dissipation production dominated regions and en strophy productions dominated regions . on the other hand ,<n> the velocity field from a recently proposed 3d random vectorial field does produce non - zero effect even in the enstroph production dominated region . <n> turbulence is one of the most studied areas in theoretical and experimental physics @xcite . in the last decade<n> , there has been a significant progress in the understanding of turbulence in terms of the multifractal structure of the fluid , which has been shown to be responsible for the non - kolmogorov turbulence , i.e. the so - called  multifractality '' . from the theoretical point of view , it is now well established that the turbulence can be divided into two main classes : ( i ) the turbulence with dissipation , and ( ii ) turbulence with entropy , the latter being the most common turbulence class . however , in spite of in this letter , we present a novel approach to the generation of intermittency in three - dimensional turbulence , based on the use of a tensorial gaussian log - correlated noise as a random field .<n> we show that this approach leads to an accurate description of the scaling properties of turbulence in terms of a single scaling parameter , which is independent of the details of the noise structure . <n> turbulence is characterized by a large spectrum of spatial scales , from small scales to large scales and from dissipation dominated to enstrophy dominated scales @xcite . in three dimensions ( 3d ) , turbulence can be classified into three main classes : ( 1 ) dissipative , ( 2 ) incompressible , and ( 3 ) viscously unstable . the latter two classes are characterized by different scaling exponents , @xmath0 , with the latter corresponding to the scaling of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) turbulence spectrum @x<n> . turbulence can also be classified as a 3d multifractal process , in which the different scales behave in different ways , e.g. enstrophic turbulence scales as we show that the probability current in fully developed inertial range turbulence is dominated by energy transfer towards the small scales .<n> this is in contrast with the gaussian case , where energy transfer is concentrated towards the large scales , and is in agreement with direct numerical simulations ( dns ) in the @xmath0 region , but is not consistent with empirical findings in the inertial range . <n> turbulence is one of the most complex physical systems in which we are confronted with a very broad range of phenomena , ranging from the propagation of waves in the atmosphere to the generation of heat in chemical reactions , from the mixing of fluid flows to the formation of granular structures in the earth s mantle @xcite . in this context , fully developed turbulence ( fd ) , as it is often called , is characterized by a very complex velocity field , consisting of a large number of components , each of which contributes to the dynamics of the system . as a consequence ,<n> the properties of fd depend strongly on the details of the kinematics of the components . for example , in the absence of an underlying kinetic energy source , the velocity field can be very inhomogeneous , with different we present direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of turbulent flows with three different types of synthetic velocity fields : gaussian , multifractal , and minimal turnover lagrangian maps .<n> we compare the numerical results with the probability currents , probability flux , vorticity stretching and enstrophy in turbulent flows . in all three cases ,<n> the dns results are in good agreement with the predictions of the navier - stokes equations . <n> turbulent flows are ubiquitous in nature and technology , but they are also one of the most challenging problems in fluid dynamics , since they involve instabilities , turbulence , dissipation and reynolds stresses , etc @xcite . despite their complexity<n> , turbulent flows can be modeled reasonably well using numerical techniques , such as direct numerical simulation ( dns)@xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . here<n> we show that three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations can be used as a powerful tool to study turbulent flows in general , with applications ranging from the study of micro - turbulence to the modeling of large - scale transport phenomena such as oceanic currents and heat transport . for turbulent flows<n>  we show that a gaussian velocity field can be generated by a sequence of kolmogorov - modified lagrangian mappings , and that the resulting velocity field is consistent with the energy spectrum of the ideal bose - einstein condensate .<n> we use this field to compute the probability current in a phenomenological model of a bose gas , obtaining good agreement with direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . <n> the velocity field obtained in this way can be used to model the velocity distribution of a gas of ultra - cold atoms , which is expected to be a good model for the  super - bose '' gas recently observed in the pierre auger observatory @xcite . in this system ,<n> the atoms are confined by a potential @xmath0 to a ring , where they can move at constant velocity . at large distances from the ring<n> , the atoms may behave as if they were at rest , with a velocity distribution that peaks at the ring s center and decreases as the ring radius is increased . for small values of the potential , _<n> i.e. _ , when the density is large compared to the thermal energy density of the fluid , we use direct numerical simulations ( dns ) to study the behavior of the anisotropic pressure hessian ( * p * ) in three - dimensional synthetic turbulence .<n> we compare the results obtained from numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations , with a direct implementation of the lagrangian hierarchy , and with synthetic velocity fields based on the multi - scale lennard - jones ( mtlm ) formalism . in particular , we study the anisotropy of the probability current , the closure of the hessian for the average pressure , as well as the dependence of * p*on the invariant @xmath0 of the velocity field . <n> synthetic turbulence is a powerful tool for the study of instabilities @xcite , since it allows one to build models that are more realistic than the ones provided by direct numerical simulation ( dds ) . to this purpose ,<n> a number of studies have been performed in recent years , starting from the analysis of the equations of motion for the velocity and pressure fields , in particular in the case of navier , stokes and maxwell ( nrq ) equations @x<n> . however  we study the behavior of the average pressure hessian ( square ) norm as a function of the invariant @xmath0 of the velocity field obtained by direct numerical simulation ( dns ) and by applying a deterministic closure .<n> we show that this average pressure norm does not vanish as seen on dns . instead , it behaves nearly linearly in the neighborhood of zero , which is in contrast with the deterministic closure which predicts a quadratic behavior . in the present work ,<n> we quantify this behavior for different synthetic velocity fields obtained by dns as well as by applying the closure , and show that the latter performs better than the former on this issue . <n> the problem of the quantification of the pressure - velocity ( * p * ) correlation in turbulent flows has attracted a lot of attention in the last years @xcite , as it plays a central role in the modeling of turbulent flows , in particular in the prediction of critical phenomena such as the collapse of large structures , the turbulence - driven turbulence transition and the formation of eddies in sheared flows . to quantify the pressure correlation in a turbulent flow<n> , one has to solve the equation of state ( eos ) of the system , @ we study the behavior of synthetic velocity fields as closure methods for the closure of velocity fields in turbulent flows .<n> we compare the performance of different synthetic velocity closure methods in reproducing dns ( direct numerical simulations ) probability currents and the square norm of the pressure hessian . for negative @xmath0<n> , we find that multifractal velocity fields perform much better than gaussian closure methods , in terms of reproducing dns probability and pressure currents . in the dissipation production dominated region ,<n> synthetic velocity field closures perform better than deterministic closures . <n> numerical simulations of turbulent flows have become a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of these systems @xcite . among the plethora of numerical methods employed , direct numerical simulation ( dns )<n> is the simplest and most commonly used closure , accounting for up to 90% of the total number of simulations carried out to date . at the same time , dns is found to be a very efficient tool to extract dynamical information , especially in the regime of strong dissipation , which is of particular interest for the study of oceanography , geomechanics , and atmospheric transport . despite the simplicity of dns , it has been shown that , despite its simplicity , in this work we address the problem of the closure of the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian in turbulent flows .<n> we show that this closure can be accurately obtained by taking into account the spatial variations of the invariant @xmath0 at different locations , and we discuss some of its properties , such as the behavior of the probability current and of the conditional mean hessian norm . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) turbulent flows are ubiquitous in natural and social systems , ranging from the management of infectious diseases to the construction of infrastructure in urban areas and the distribution of waste in the earth s atmosphere . in the case of atmospheric and oceanic flows ,<n> the most important characteristic is the formation of turbulence , which is characterized by a large turbulent velocity field , or equivalently , a turbulent pressure @xcite , that is proportional to the local dissipation rate . despite the large number of published results , the relation between the turbulent pressure and the turbulent energy flux , as well as between the energy density and the pressure in the turbulent flow , is still an open problem . here , we address this problem by studying the closure in this work , we investigate the role played by the hessian of the spatial invariant @xmath0 of the poisson equation in the pressure hessian .<n> we show that this invariant plays a crucial role in the relation between the deviatoric and the anisotropic parts of the pressure tensor . in particular , this allows us to derive an exact relation between these two pressure tensors , which is valid for arbitrary length scales . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the spatial variation of a physical quantity is governed by the spatial profile of its invariant , i.e. by its position and its value at different locations . as a consequence ,<n> the corresponding pressure tensor can be written as a convolution of a pressure and a kolmogorov length - scale dependent quantity , the pressure - hessian @xcite . here<n> we will focus on the pressure , or equivalently the anisotropy , of the equation of state ( eos ) of a quantum system , and its relation with the eos of a classical system . for a given eos<n> , one can define an invariant that characterizes the spatial variations of this quantity . we show that periodic dns under study , in which @xmath0 is the deviatoric part of the pressure , can be considered as a lagrangian version of the periodic dns , with anisotropic pressure and vorticity fields .<n> this is done by expressing the anisotropy fields in terms of local properties of the invariant @xcite , which is an invariant of the dns flow , and by using the fact that the lagrangians under study are periodic in time . in this way , we are able to show that the kolmogorov - like length scale is not necessary for the existence of the vortices . <n> the study of periodic dynamical systems ( dns ) has a long history , going back to the work of e.g. de gennes in the 19th century , but has recently received renewed attention in the context of turbulence , driven by advances in computer science and experimental physics . a common feature of these flows is the presence of vortex - antivortex pairs , i.e. , of vortical fields , at or near the vortex lines . the vortex - vortex pair ( vbp ) , in this work , we investigate the hessian tensor structure of the navier - stokes equations for the pressure and for the equation of state @xmath0 , for periodic and quasi - periodic boundary conditions .<n> we perform differential numerical simulations ( dns ) for the periodic case , in which the derivative of the pressure is computed in fourier space , using a highly resolved dns . for the quasi - periodical case<n> , the results are presented in the form of an analytic expression in terms of local hessians , which are found to be well correlated with the density contours of the periodic dns flows . <n> numerical integration of differential equations ( odes ) is a very active field of research , with many different applications in different fields of science @xcite . among them , numerical integration is of particular interest in several fields , such as fluid dynamics , oceanography , astrophysics , medicine , among others . in this context ,<n> the development of numerical methods capable of accurately solving coupled odes has been a topic of great interest in the last few years , both theoretically and experimentally , see e.g. refs . [ eq : general ] we study the response of a compressible incompressible fluid to an applied pressure in the framework of a recently introduced tensorial extension of the navier - stokes equations .<n> we find that the tensorial formalism allows us to derive a local expression for the probability current , which is in good agreement with direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the full equations of motion . in particular , the local expression reproduces the counteractive action of the pressure along the right tail of the vieillefosse line , as well as the redistribution of the probability in dissipation and enstrophy production dominated regions . <n> the study of compressible fluids has been a subject of intense research over the last two decades , due to its relevance for a wide range of applications , ranging from oil recovery to traffic management @xcite . despite the impressive progress made in the description of these systems ,<n> there are still many open questions regarding their response to external stimuli , such as the confinement of their fluid constituents , or the nature of the interaction between the constituents . to this purpose<n> , it has recently been proposed to consider the effect of an external pressure on the flow in terms of an effective compressible fluid . we provide a local expression for the probability of occurrence of the counteractive action of the pressure along the right tail of the vieillefosse line , based on @xmath0 .<n> we find that the probability is found in a void in probability , in dissipation production dominated regions , and in the enstrophy production dominated region , as observed in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations . on the whole , however , the behavior of the local expression in terms of the prbability fluxes agrees quite well with the results of the dns . <n> [ [ section ] ] direct numerical simulation ( dns)@xcite ( dns ) is a very powerful tool to study the nonlinear hydrodynamics of a turbulent fluid . in the dns approach ,<n> the equation of state ( eos ) and the probability current are calculated in a closed form , which is obtained by solving numerically the equations of motion for the eos and the current @xcite . for a given value of the reynolds number , _<n> i.e. _ the ratio of the amplitude of the current to that of the turbulent pressure , @x the lagrangian structure of the velocity gradient tensor is investigated in the case of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and synthetic velocity fields .<n> we show that the tensor invariant @xmath0 , which governs the statistical properties of the probability current and the expectation of the pressure hessian norm , is in excellent agreement with the local approximation for the velocity field , even for the simplest gaussian approximation . on the other hand ,<n> the conditional expectation of this invariant is found to be in very good agreement with dns results . <n> [ [ section ] ] the velocity - gradient tensor ( vgm ) is a key quantity in understanding the dynamics of turbulence . in the simplest case , i.e. in an ideal gas , the vgm tensor is proportional to the pressure in the gas and to the velocity itself @xcite . however , in more complex situations , such as in turbulent flows , this proportionality is no longer valid . for example , it has been shown that the pressure tensor of an incompressible gas is not proportional to its own pressure , and that it can not be expressed as a simple function of the reynolds number , @ the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor is studied in the context of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .<n> first , we show that synthetic velocity fields reproduce many properties of the pressure hessian that governs much of the lagrangians in dns flows , such as the non - trivial behavior of the probability current , and the conditional expectation of thepressure hessian norm on the invariant @xmath0 . also , the simplest gaussian approximation for the velocity field can represent some non -trivial behaviors of the pressures that could not be predicted by the closures in terms of * a * @xcite . then , based on an exact field description of the hessian by means of nonlocal integrals , local closures involving a finite set of ordinary differential equations<n> are proposed , for studying the statistical nature of this hessian . <n> lagrangin dynamics is a powerful tool for the study of turbulence , as it allows us to follow the evolution of a large number of parameters in a time - ordered fashion , starting from an initial value problem . in the simplest case , that of a homogeneous and isotropic fluid ,<n> the dynamics is governed by the velocity - gradient tensor @x the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor ( @xmath0 ) is investigated in the case of a homogeneous isotropic flow in a spherical ball .<n> we show that matrix exponentials can be used as local closures of the pressure hessian , and the poisson equation , that describes the deformation of the coordinate system due to stretching and rotation of the fluid , can be recovered as a particular case of the closure proposed in [ g. eyink and b. lthi , phys . <n> rev . a * 71 * , 062302 ( 2005 ) ] . for a time @xcite<n> early in the evolution of the ball , we find that the pressure and the gradient tensors behave very differently . in the later part of the evolution ,<n> we observe a transition from isotropic to isotropic pressure gradients , followed by a transition to an isotropic gradient - like behavior , in which the pressure is proportional to the gradient of the flow , but the gradient - tensors are no longer isotropic . *<n> pacs numbers : * 45.70.vn , 47.27.te * in recent years , a great deal the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor is a key ingredient in the phenomenology of turbulence @xcite .<n> however , the theoretical foundations of this concept are not well - established . here , we present an analytic solution of a recently proposed closure for the velocity - gradient tensor , based on a perturbation expansion of the closure in powers of the gradient s divergence . using direct numerical simulations ( dns ) ,<n> we show that this expansion converges rapidly to a closed form for small values of the divergence @xmath0 , while for large values it diverges . as a consequence , in the large - scale reynolds - number limit<n> the closure is no longer the same as the one proposed in ref . <n> [ eq : cmph ] , but is instead a linear combination of two terms , one representing the local gradient and the other a global one . in the small - scale limit , where the velocity field is well - approximated by a kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( k - am ) turbulence model , this closure is equivalent to the recently proposed chevillard - meneveau ( cm ) we present a new approach to the stochastic representation of the local geometric structure of turbulence .<n> the method is based on a lagrangian map approach , where the local velocity field is decomposed into a non - gaussian random component , which we synthesize from the trajectories of lagrangians , and a stationary velocity field . in this way<n> , we are able to represent the velocity field in terms of ortho - normal quaternion frames , for which we prove the equivalence with the direct numerical simulation of incompressible turbulence ( dns ) . <n> turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide variety of contexts , such as atmospheric and oceanic transport @xcite , oceanography @x<n> . however , our understanding of turbulence is still far from complete , despite intensive research efforts @xmath0 over the last two decades . despite this ,<n> the statistical geometric structure ( sgs ) of turbulence has not been well understood and is not easily accessible for numerical simulations . to this end , a number of stochastic representations of the sg of turbulence have been proposed . among these , the most promising are the stochastic representations based on lagrangi we present the results of a three - dimensional simulation of synthetic turbulent flow .<n> the turbulent flow is generated by the _ in - situ _ generation of a large number of @xmath0-particles , each of which is injected into the flow from a well - defined initial condition . using a minimal multi - scale lagrangian map approach<n> , we synthesize the synthetic turbulent velocity field , which is found to be non - gaussian and time - dependent , with an anomalous scaling exponent , in agreement with recent numerical simulations . <n> synthetic turbulence ( srf ) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in fluid dynamics , finding applications in a wide range of fields , from oil recovery to oceanography @xcite . despite its ubiquity ,<n> the underlying physical mechanisms are not well understood , although it is generally believed that the turbulence is characterized by a large reynolds number , a small scale power - law spectrum , and an intermittency that grows with the scale of the flow , similar to what is observed in natural turbulence . in this letter<n> we show that the synthetic turbulence exhibits a number of properties that are not observed in real turbulence , such as anomalous scaling ",

jet system , 3c 75 , located in ngc 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster abell 400 , suggest that there are two colliding jets . motivated by these observations , we study the interaction between two bipolar jets by performing hydrodynamical simulations using a modified version of the gpu - accelerated adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamical parallel code ( _ gamer _ ) developed at the institute of astrophysics of national taiwan university .<n> we find that the collision of bipolar jets is extremely energetic events , thus they offer a unique opportunity to study astrophysical plasma under extreme conditions and infer the physical properties of jets based on the comparison of hydrodynamical ( and magneto - hydrodynamical ) simulations with observations . we present the results of our hydrodynamical simulations of colliding jets and provide a possible physical explanation for the twisted morphology of the jets systems of 3c 75 .<n> we modeled the jets as bipolar outflows of high temperature , light fluid launched from cylindrical nozzles at the center of our simulation box with velocities that are expected for these jets when they propagate to extragalactic distances . since we deal with non - relativistic jet velocities , we may adopt the equations of ideal non - relativity hydrodynamics . in our first study of jet collisions we assumed an initially homogeneous isothermal ambient gas and a continuous inflow of gas with constant injection velocity , and fixed density and temperature for each of the two stationary jets . using a modified version of the gpu - accelerated adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamical parallel code ( _ gamer_) developed at the institute of astrophysics of national taiwan university we carried out our simulations to study the collisions between jets from fr i sources . we found that the colliding jets are launched at relativistic speeds ( @xmath0 ) from their agns , but they are significantly decelerated by the time they reach the edge of their host galaxies ( v@xmath1 ) , we have carried out a series of tests on the performance of a gpu - accelerated hydrodynamical parallel code ( _ gamer _ ) developed at the national taiwan university .<n> the parallel performance has been highly optimized by implementing ( 1 ) hybrid mpi / openmp / gpu parallelization , ( 2 ) concurrent execution between multiple cpus and gpus ; ( 3 ) asynchronous data transfer from cpus to gpus and ( 4 ) hilbert space - filling curve for load balancing . the code supports a variety of hydrodynamic schemes . in this work<n> we adopt the corner - transport - upwind method , roe s riemann solver , and the piecewise parabolic data reconstruction schemes , which are found to result in the overall performance using these schemes being @xmath0 cell updates per second on a single nvidia k40 gpu which is two orders of magnitude faster than a single cpu core and one order of magnitude slower than a ten - core cpu using an intel xeon e5 - 2670 v2 cpu at 2.50 ghz . recent radio and x - ray observations of 3c 75 have provided new insights into the physics of colliding bipolar extragalactic jets .<n> we present simulations of two bipolar jets with different injection velocities , cross sections , densities , and temperatures for the jets and the ambient gas . <n> the collision of bipolar jets from super - eddington relativistic outflows ( @xmath0 ) is one of the most important processes in the universe , since it may account for the bulk of the energy released in gamma - rays and/or be the dominant mechanism for driving bipolar jets into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite . in this study , we focus on the qualitative aspects of the collision process , in particular on the fate of the shocked jet material and on the implications for the propagation of the jet shock through the igm and into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . to that end , the first step in our study is to determine the conditions under which bipolar jets may collide with each other and produce the observed diffuse emission seen in the x - rays or the diffuse emission observed in the radio band , which may be attributed to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from the we present simulations relevant to our qualitative analysis of head - on collisions of bipolar extragalactic jets .<n> we modeled the two jets with different injection velocities , cross sections , densities , and temperatures for the jets and the ambient gas . with future applications in mind , we chose the physical parameters of our jet system to match those derived for 3c 75 based on radio and x - ray observations @xcite . we fixed the initial density and temperature for the gas at values suggested by the observations of 3c75 , which are @xmath0g@xmath1 and @x kev . <n> we simulated both sides of the two bipolar jets with a simulation box size of 20 kpc , modeling the main jet propagation , outflow boundary conditions , the two jet collisions , as well as the interaction of the jets with their surroundings . in our simulations ,<n> the total energy in the colliding jets is not very sensitive to the injected jet velocity , density , or temperature , but only to the impact parameter of the collision . when the injected energy is high , @x<n> , colliding jets have a much smaller impact parameter and produce a more extended outflow than when the energy is we present a study of the interaction between the jets in 3c 75 , a well known active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with two bipolar jets .<n> the observed morphology of the jet sources suggests that the two jets interact with each other in a head - on fashion , with a projected distance of about 7.5 kpc for a projected jet source distance of 10 kpc . in simulations of jet collisions<n> we find that the interaction does not lead to significant changes in the structure of the second jet , but it does produce a bipolar structure of a few arcseconds in length , which is not observed in the jets of nearby agns . <n> active galaxies , quasars : general , galaxies : jets , bl lacertae objects : individual ( 3c75 ) , jets and outflows , radio continuum : galaxies the jet - dominated jets in agn are believed to be launched by the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of galaxies @xcite , and are powered by accretion onto a smbh , or by nuclear black holes in the host galaxy . agn jets can also be launched from stellar mass black holes at the center we perform three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of two relativistic jets in the early stage of the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) at @xmath0 = 200 gev .<n> we show that the interaction between the two jets leads to a strong increase in the projected energy density of the collision region , and , as a consequence , to a significant modification of the energy spectra of the produced particles . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) are among the most violent events in the history of the universe , with more than 200 pb@xmath1 produced in a single rhic event @xcite . in the first stage of a hic ,<n> the energy release in each individual nucleon - nucleon collision is comparable , but the total energy of the system is much larger than that of the individual nucleons . as a result , a large fraction of the initial energy is released in the form of relativistic particles , leading to the formation of a hot , dense matter , called the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) , which is one of the main candidates for the state of matter produced in these collisions @x we study numerically the dynamics of relativistic jets propagating through a medium of soft matter ( @xmath0 ) .<n> the initial conditions are chosen to be those expected in the early stages of a binary collision of two ionized plasmas . in all cases where the impact parameter is finite , we find that the jets can bounce off each other and survive as individuals , but in some cases , after collision , the jets develop instabilities and break up into oscillating filaments . <n> relativistic jets are the main source of particle production in high energy heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at rhic and the lhc ( large hadron collider ) @xcite . during the early stage of a hic ,<n> the energy deposited in the form of particles and matter is initially very high , and as a consequence , a large number of jets are expected to be produced in a single hic event . at the same time , however , there is a limit to the amount of energy that can be transferred from the matter to the jets , which is called the  soft - matter '' limit . as a result of the interaction between the soft matter and the relativistic jets  we study the dynamics of jets produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .<n> we find that colliding jets can be classified into two categories : ( 1 ) bouncing and ( 2 ) merging jets . in the bouncing case ,<n> the jets keep their identities and travel relatively unaffected , while in the merging case they may merge . <n> collisions of relativistic jets produce a variety of phenomena , including the production of vorticity , jets quenching , and the formation of vortices . here<n> we present the results of a systematic study of the collision dynamics of ultrarelativistic ( @xmath0 ) , highly anisotropic ( v@xmath1 ) incompressible , hydrodynamic ( 3d ) jets , using simulations of the relativistic boltzmann equation with a constant anisotropy parameter , p = 0.8 . using the enstrophy and helicity as input variables , we compute the energy density , scaled entropy per particle , enstroph , helicity , the shear viscosity , v / p ratio , as well as the kinetic energy and the impact parameter . for jets with a we study the dynamics of jets produced in the early stage of a binary collision of two neutron stars ( ns ) , neutron stars and black holes ( bh ) produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .<n> we find that , in the absence of black - hole formation , the system undergoes a phase of bouncing jets before and after the collision , during which the spread of the jets is limited by the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet . during this phase ,<n> the total energy density of the system is @xmath0 5% of its maximum value , and two jets with different lorentz factors collide , resulting in two types of jets : ( 1 ) jets bouncing from left to right ; and ( 2 ) merging jets , which merge when their impact parameter is small and their velocity is large . <n> the two - body collision of a ns - ns binary system at rhic produces a system of nuclear matter , consisting of two nucleons , one of which is bound to the ns and the other moving away from us with a high velocity . at the same time , jets of different when two jets collide in a collisionless environment , the instabilities in the jets increase , and as they propagate , they generate more turbulence and drive more waves as they generate , as they collide , more waves . in this paper , we study the collision of two relativistic jets propagating through an ambient medium .<n> the jets collide when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small . as a consequence of this collision ,<n> the spread of the jets increases . when the jets merge the spread is limited because a second jet disappears . for small impact parameters and small velocity gradients the two jets merge , otherwise they bounce . <n> collisions of relativistic jets are important in many astrophysical contexts , such as collisions of black holes , collisions of comets , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , etc @xcite . at the highest energies ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 ergs ) , or when the kinetic energy of the collision is comparable to the gravitational energy , jets can collide with an impact parameter as small as @x.1 . here<n> we investigate the properties of collisions of jets with impact parameters in the range @x we perform hydrodynamical simulations of colliding pairs of jets from different initial velocities and different impact parameters .<n> we find that the instabilities in colliding jets grow non - linearly after the collision , and that they affect the gas in the jet . as a result ,<n> the energy and momentum flux in the colliding jet system are reduced , but not eliminated . <n> the collision of two or more colliding jets is one of the most important events in the history of jet physics . in the early universe<n> , this event is expected to be the most violent one , since protons and nuclei are expected to collide and form part of the densest matter in the universe @xcite . at the same time , the interaction of relativistic jets with the surrounding medium is also expected to play an important role , because the relativistic jets are the main source of kinetic energy in the central parsec of the expanding fireball . here , we present the first results of a program aimed at studying the collision and subsequent evolution of colliding and non - interacting relativistic jets , using three - dimensional ( 3d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of the hydrodynamics of jets colliding with a realistic density gradient @xmath extragalactic jets are powerful and fast magnetohydrodynamic turbulence can create instabilities in the jets and break them into filaments .<n> however , little is known about the dynamics of the turbulence and jets in the ambient medium . here , we present the results of three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of colliding and interacting jets . studying the properties of the jets ,<n> we show that filaments form in some cases , but are not frequently seen in radio images . <n> [ firstpage ] hydrodynamics turbulence is one of the most important physical processes in the universe , which plays an important role in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena , including star formation , stellar evolution , chemical enrichment , galaxy formation and many others . in the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , turbulence<n> is related to the motion of the fluid ( electrons , protons , magnetic field , ... ) through a complex network of small - scale loops ( @xmath0 cm ) of coupled resistively - shunted vortices ( rtvs ) @xcite . as a result of the rtv turbulence<n> , the jets expand and interact with each other and with the surrounding medium  we study the formation and evolution of filaments in colliding extragalactic radio jets , using numerical simulations .<n> we find that the filaments can form in collisional filaments only far from the source ( @xmath0 kpc ) unless the collision is strong , i.e. , the impact parameter is small . however , filaments of the form , which are not frequently seen in radio images , are likely to form in lower - pressure regions in the ambient medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop . <n> filaments in radio - emitting jets are the result of collisions between the jets and turbulence generated in the filaments . in our simulations ,<n> most of the enstrophy ( turbulence ) is generated near the jet centers , and the maximum distance to which the jets can propagate as coherent structures increases monotonically as the impact parameters are increased . as the jets propagate , more of the turbulence ( vorticity ) , most of it in the form of filaments , is generated close to the jet source . we show that , in general , collisions between jets can not form filaments in the jet interior , where the jet velocity is high . instead , jets can form we present the results of numerical simulations of the collisions of two jets with different jet velocities and impact parameters .<n> the jets are initially prepared in a state of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and their velocities are tuned to be consistent with the experimental data of the 3356 beam of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . for each model jet ,<n> the enstrophy of the colliding jets is calculated as a function of the distance along the jet and the impact parameter at the collision point . <n> the simulations show that the maximum of the ellipticity of the collision is larger for colliding jets with smaller impact parameters and lower jet velocities ( @xmath0 ) . in the simulations , we find a  phase transition '' at a critical point of the impact parameters as a result of the generation of more turbulence in the collision region as compared to the collision of two interacting jets with fixed jet velocities . at the critical point<n> , the maximum ellipticities are larger for interacting jets and lower for collision of non - interacting jets . [<n> fig : test3356projz ] ] the rhic beam of heavy ions at brook we show that the amount of enstrophy generated in the early stage of the collision between two ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision progenitors , such as the one expected in the lhc - b factory , is larger than previously thought .<n> this is because the collision results in the rapid dissipation of the kinetic energy of the colliding jets into shocks and turbulence , and , as a result , the enstroph maxima are larger than those predicted by hydrodynamical models . in this paper<n> , we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the early , inhomogeneous , high - speed collision between the progenitors of the recently discovered super - soft @xmath0ray sources , s@xmath1 , at a center of mass energy of 500 gev , which will be one of the main targets of the ongoing program of relativistic heavy ion colliders at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . <n> the properties of the gas that will be colliding with the high - energy jets of the relativistic jet source ( rts ) will be imprinted on the surrounding medium during the early stages of the interaction . as the source evolves , it the dynamics of jets in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is of great interest for several reasons .<n> first , jets are believed to be efficient tools to probe the innermost parts of the agn progenitors , thus providing direct evidence for the formation of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . in particular ,<n> jets are expected to be formed in the wake of an accreting black hole , and they are also expected to form in the aftermath of mergers between galaxies . here<n> we report the first direct observational evidence for a smbh in the nearby galaxy cluster 3c 75 , where two bipolar jets are produced by a low entropy core moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 1200 km / sec . using numerical simulations , we study the jet formation and the jet properties in this system , as well as the correlations between the jet emission , the jet kinematics and the radio and optical images of the system . <n> the study of agn jets is of particular interest for the following reasons : ( i ) jets are efficient tracers of mergers and interactions between galaxies and thus can be used to study the formation and evolution of black holes ; ( ii  we present new radio , optical , and x - ray observations of the radio galaxy 3c 75 in the perseus cluster .<n> these observations were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) on mauna kea , with the very large array ( vla ) and with the _ chandra _ observatory , as part of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) large program . <n> we found that the jets of the two active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the cluster are bending as they move through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of about 1200 km / sec . the jets are bending due to ram pressure from the ambient medium , which is due to the relative movement of the agn in 3c75 between their sources . at the same time ,<n> the jets from the northern agn are bending to the north by about 45@xmath0 where their path crosses that of the northern jet of the southern agn , suggesting that the bending of the jet from the north agn at this location is a result of a collision with the jet in the southern the x - ray source 3c 75 was observed by _ chandra _ in the year 2000 .<n> it is one of the brightest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the northern hemisphere , and is associated with a highly collimated ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 mjy ) jet from the northern branch of the supermassive black hole in the center of ngc 6240 . in this contribution<n> , we present new _ xmm - newton _ observations of this source , as well as new hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction region between the jets and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) . <n> _ introduction : _ the study of jets in agn has a long history , going back to the 1960 s , when zeldovich observed the curvature of the radio jets associated with the black holes in seyfert galaxies @xcite . since then , jets have been discovered in a variety of sources , including low - luminosity quasars ( llabz ) and active galaxies in general , but it is only very recently that their properties have been studied in more detail , especially in we carried out hydrodynamical simulations to study extragalactic jet collisions . we found that colliding jets can be cast into two categories : bouncing and merging jets .<n> we have shown that two fast jets colliding with non - zero impact parameter bounce off each other keeping their identities , but jets with very different velocities colliding with a small impact parameter merge into one jet , and the faster jet takes over the slower jet . we present hydrodynamical simulations of the relativistic jets in 3c 75 , a well - studied microquasar known for its powerful thermonuclear flashes .<n> our simulations show that the twisted radio morphology of this source can be explained by instabilities in the jet with a small , but finite impact parameter : the faster jet collides with a much slower jet , which then bounces and merges with it . <n> observations of thermonuclear jets in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have shown that a large fraction of the jets are collimated by magnetic fields , with the magnetic field in the jets estimated to be @xmath0@xmath1 g @xcite . in some agn ,<n> the jets have been found to collide with each other , leading to the formation of knots in the inter - jet medium ( icm ) . here<n> , we present the first results of a numerical study of the hydrodynamical interactions between jets in a compact agn to study the dynamics of the collimating jets and their interactions with the host galaxy s jets . using a new hydrodynamical code , _ flash _ , developed at the asc / alliance center for astrophysical we present results of hydrodynamical simulations of jet interactions in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev / nucleon .<n> the initial conditions are chosen to mimic those expected at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , and the jets are produced with the  enstrophy ' method , in which the maximum value of the jet s entropy is calculated as a function of the impact parameter and the mass ratio of the colliding particles . in order to reproduce the observed spectra of elliptic flow and triangular flow , jets are required to merge with each other within a few fm / c after impact . at the rhic energy ,<n> the ratio of jet luminosities is larger than at rhic energies in central collisions , suggesting that the merging process is less efficient than previously thought . <n> collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies are expected to lead to the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the collision zone , a state of matter in which matter is deconfined and equilibrated , but which is not dense enough to equilibrate efficiently on the timescale of the collision itself @xcite . as a result  the evolution of the transverse momentum ( enstrophy ) in the central region of the lhc collision at @xmath0 = 7 tev is studied by means of hydrodynamical simulations and a phenomenological model .<n> we find that the maximum values of the enstroph at impact parameter p = 0.3 decrease with increasing jet injection velocity , but remain constant at 18000 km s@xmath1 . at the highest jet injection velocities ,<n> the maximum value of the entropy is reached at the shock front , while at lower injection velocities it is reached first at the baroclinic point , and then at the impact point itself . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) at energies above 100 gev offer a unique opportunity to explore the behavior of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the equation of state ( eos ) of the qgp at extreme densities and temperatures . in rhic<n> , the collision of two unequal - energy projectiles ( one proton , one electron , or a quark and an anti - quark ) produces a high - density plasma , known as the hadronic medium ( hjm ) , which is",

law profile , eq.([kappa ] ) , which fits the observation better than the best - fit nfw profiles , may indicate some contradiction to the cdm cosmology . in order to study the possibility of fermion degeneracy near the center of the cluster , we need information on the volume density , instead of the mass column density . recent papers @xcite claim that the weak lensing signals from galaxy clusters are consistent with the cdm cosmology . in this letter , we show that the core power - law profile used in @xmath0 , fits the observation better than the best - fit nfw profile and we use this profile for further discussion . however , if we use the observed column density profile , which is a core power law profile with a core radius , the best fit parameters somewhat depend on the range of integration .<n> for instance , for the nfw profiles , when integrated over the range 1.41.4mpc , it is better to use the core profile . on the other hand ,<n> if we solve the volume density profile using a standard method like the abel transform , using the observed cluster core , then we can see the changes of the core radius and the power law index . <n> the weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to probe the large scale structure of the universe , since it is sensitive to the mass distribution in clusters of galaxies . recently<n> , a number of works have claimed that the cluster -

baryonic and has a non - zero fraction of baryons . as a result , a large number of clusters have been found to host dark matter halos , and many of them have been studied in the theoretical framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is a popular extension of the sm to non - we study the distribution of fermionic dark matter in a self - gravitating system assuming that the entire matter consists purely of degenerate fermions and modify the formulation for the case that the fractional contribution of dark matter density to the total matter density is constant .<n> we find that the density profile is strongly dependent on the degree of degeneracy and the fermi energy level . for nonrelativistic particles with a relative velocity<n> @xmath0 cm , the condition for high degenerity is satisfied . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in using dark matter as a probe of the early universe @xcite . in this picture ,<n> dark matter particles are considered to be collisionless particles and their distribution is supposed to be independent of the nature of the dark matter . however , recent observations of astrophysical objects such as quasars , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have revealed that a significant fraction of the total mass of the universe is in the form of cold , collisionless , or weakly interacting particles , which are so - called dark matter ( dm ) particles . the dm particles are degenerate fermions may not be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( ehse ) at a given radius .<n> this degeneracy will be dissolved by classical kinetic energy , or velocity dispersion , as the radius increases . here<n> we give a brief description of how to insert the ehse equation , @xmath0 , into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , eq.([peos],[ef ] ) , which is derived in a textbook of statistical physics . from this ehse<n> , we obtain the expression for the pressure in a degenerate degenerate gas . <n> the pressure of a degenerate gas may play an important role in determining the structure of a stellar system . in the early universe @xcite , gas was thought to be the main component of the universe , while in the last decades it has been considered to be a mixture of various components , such as stars , planets , and white dwarfs , among others . the gas component ,<n> however , was found to be much more stable than the mixture of different components . for a long time<n> it was believed that the origin of the stable gas was the gravitational interaction between the stars @x we study the dynamical equilibrium of dark - matter clusters with light fermions .<n> the mass density is assumed to be proportional to the total mass density of the entire universe , and the baryon contribution is taken into account in the ratio of baryon to dark matter , @xmath0 . in this case , the pressure of the cluster gas is the same as that of collisionless particles , so that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium . we find that the total cluster mass increases as the cluster radius increases , in agreement with observations . <n> dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most intriguing topics in cosmology , since it is responsible for about one - third of the baryonic matter in the universe and it is the main component of dark energy @xcite . among various candidates for dm<n> , fermionic dark matter has received the most attention because of its theoretically predicted high baryon - to - dark matter ratio , as well as because it may account for a significant fraction of entire dark matter in galactic halos . however ,<n> direct evidence for the presence of dm has not yet been obtained , due to the lack of direct information on the radial dependence of clusters of galaxies are the most massive virialized systems in the universe , and their gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to study cluster structure and dynamics . here<n> we report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed cluster of galaxies at the center of a massive galaxy cluster .<n> the mass of the lensed galaxy is about @xmath0 , which is about three orders of magnitude larger than the virial masses of the other galaxies in the cluster , suggesting that the cluster is dominated by hot intracluster gas rather than by dark matter . <n> the spatial distribution of the cluster galaxies is strongly non - isothermal , with a core - power - law profile at large radii and a tail extending out to the einstein radius , in agreement with observations of elliptical galaxies in cluster cores @xcite . in order to account for the observed distribution of cluster galaxies ,<n> we propose that the dark matter in clusters is composed of a mixture of baryonic and fermionic components , the latter of which is non - negligible on average for the entire universe . by incorporating the baryon contribution into the density profile<n> , we find that the fermion - to - dark - matter ratio is about 1:5 gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the density profile of galaxy clusters .<n> however , it is well known that lensing can not provide a unique determination of the cluster s density profile , since it is based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) . in this paper<n> we show that the volume density profile can be determined from the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gravitationally lensed cluster , if the lensing cluster has a velocity dispersion smaller than the critical velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , for hydrostatic equilibrium to hold , as long as the velocity dispersion does not exceed the critical value . <n> the gravitational lens effect @xcite is the most powerful lensing tool available to us , because it allows us to study the density profiles of galaxies out to very large distances , where the gravitational field is strong , and out to redshifts of order unity , which are inaccessible to all other means of observation so far . the most robust observable from strong gravitational lenses is the 2d encircled mass within the einstein radius . on the other hand ,<n> the best observable is the power - law slope of the column density profile between the radial and tangential critical curves . we propose a new dark matter candidate , the ultrarelativistic dark matter ( udm ) , which is a mixture of neutralino and fermion dark matter .<n> this is based on the einstein - rosen - schwarz ( ehse ) solution of a flat - top cluster , in which the pressure due to degeneracy pressure of neutralinos is balanced by that due to the presence of fermions . in our model ,<n> the fraction of the dark matter density that is due to neutralino density is assumed to be unity , while the statistical weight , @xmath0 , of the neutralino dark matter is given by the value of the virial theorem . from the susy expectation , each known boson<n> is expected to have a fermionic component . <n> s / n@xmath1 0.5 cm _ introduction. _<n> the existence of non - baryonic dark matter @xcite is now a well - established observational fact , based on a large number of different probes , including kinematics , dynamics , and abundances . however , there is still no general consensus on the nature of dark matter and we examine the constraints imposed by dark matter models on the particle content and the fraction of the fermion density to the entire dark matter density .<n> we find that the allowed range of the particle mass is restricted to the order of ev , if the degeneracy pressure is significant only near the flat - top cluster core , whose size is order of 100 kpc . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the existence of non - baryonic dark matter in the form of fermionic clusters has been postulated long ago @xcite . in this scenario ,<n> dark matter particles are assumed to be neutralino - like superpartners of baryons , which are the constituents of dark matter clusters . due to the small mass differences among the three species , they must have a similar mass ( degenerate hierarchy ) and their presence is well known . however , susy predicts that each known boson is expected to have a superpartner , probably the photino . since the lack of experimental detection at energy scales less than 10 gev , indicates that photinos are massive and are more of a candidate for cold dark matter . #<n> we attempt to build a massive neutrino cluster in the gravitational potential of a single dark matter cluster .<n> we assume that the dark matter is non - baryonic and that relic neutrinos with the mass , @xmath0 ev , are responsible for the dissipative collapse of baryons in the early universe , while majorana and dirac neutrinos contribute to the formation of the cluster core . using the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillation data , we find that the present mass density of the neutrino cluster , , is estimated to be , and that the total mass density to neutrino mass density ,<n> , can be higher than the average value due to the dissiution of collapse of dark matter particles . <n> the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern cosmology @xcite . in order to solve this problem , a large number of massive dark matter ( dm ) clusters<n> are expected to form in the universe and are the most promising candidates for the dm candidates . however , the number density of dm clusters is expected to be so low as to be unobservable in the present day universe . to we present an attempt to solve the einstein - yang - mills equation ( ehse ) , which is a non - perturbative problem in particle physics , by introducing a scalar field , fermions , with a mass , @xmath0 , and a coupling to neutrinos .<n> the coupling is assumed to be strong enough to produce a radial critical curve in the density profile of fermionic matter . to solve ehse<n> , we add a toy galaxy placed at the center to the particle density and compare the result with that without this hypothetical galaxy . for simplicity , the volume- and column density profiles<n> are almost identical as shown in the paper . <n> the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe has been well established by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the galaxy power spectrum , as well as by the measurements of the hubble constant and the abundance of heavy elements . in the standard cdm scenario ,<n> the cdm particles are massive and neutral , while the neutrinos are massive , light and cold . we show that a wide variety of dark matter models , which include both neutrinos and nondegenerate cold dark matter particles , can reproduce the observed 3d galaxy cluster mass profiles .<n> the range of particle mass is @xmath0 ev for the cosmic baryon - dark matter ratio of 0.2 . for @x.5 ,<n> successful solutions have smaller particle masses . the maximum allowed particle mass , , is obtained for the cases that dark matter consists of neutrinos . <n> the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( ndm ) in the universe has been well established by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe . in the past few years<n> , there has been increasing interest in the possibility of a new form of matter , dark energy , as well as dark matter itself , the so - called  dark matter '' ( dm ) . among the various forms of dark energy models <n> there is a popular idea that the energy density of the dm is proportional to the temperature of the hot big - bang plasma ( bbn ) we present fermion mass solutions to the einstein - klein - gordon equation ( ehse ) , in which the deficiency in the local mass profile at the center may be accounted for by a single massive galaxy .<n> the resultant profiles are essentially identical and they are not distinguishable from the general fermionic cases . in particular , there is a dip of the fermi level in the model with the galaxy near the origin of spherical symmetry , where the fractional contribution of the galaxy to the 3d encircled mass is the greatest . <n> the mass profiles obtained by @xcite include the contribution of galaxies , whose contribution to the mass profile is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath0% ) of local mass deficiency with respect to the observed value . a brightest cluster galaxy at the central region of a cluster , typically has a stellar mass in excess of that of the cluster and may account for a 2% deficiency . since a toy galaxy has a total mass of @ x@xmath1 and a gaussian volume profile with the scale length of 20 kpc , we did not perform any fitting or adjustment of the galaxies model parameters , except that the total mass corresponds to a 3d the equation of state ( eos ) at the cluster center is degenerate in the sense that relic neutrinos are moderately degenerate , while fermions and bosons are not .<n> the eos is softened locally by the stellar mass of the galaxy , but the dip of the fermi level there is not present locally by an external mass source unaffected by the dark matter distribution . <n> the cluster of galaxies is the largest in the universe , because of the gravitational interaction between dark matter and dark energy . in the present paper<n> , we study the cosmological implications of this eos in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is one of the most promising candidates to solve the strong cp problem and to explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) and of the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite . as a first step ,<n> we show that in the model with the galaxy as an external source of dark matter , there is a dip in the fermionic eos near the center , where the galaxy is spherically symmetric , and that there is no dip at the center in the case of the clusters of neutrinos with mass @xmath0 ev are expected to form in the early universe due to the decay of massive neutrinos .<n> we study the effect of neutrino mass on the cluster formation . in the cluster core ,<n> the fermi level and neutrino temperature are of order 10@xmath1 ev or above , which indicates that relic neutrinos are cold enough so that they can fall to the cluster . on the other hand , under adiabatic expansion , the degree of degeneracy is expected to change slightly , but this effect appears minor . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#1 the existence of neutrino masses in the range of 1 ev @xcite is one of the most intriguing predictions of high energy neutrino physics . for a long time<n> , it has been believed that neutrinos have mass of the order of ev , and that the lightest neutrinos in the universe should be massless , i.e. , neutrinos do not mix with ordinary matter . however , recent observations of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons by the pierre auger collaboration indicate that the electron / posit we study the effect of neutrino degeneracy on the dark matter halos of galaxy clusters , assuming that neutrinos are nonrelativistic and undergo adiabatic expansion .<n> we find that the degree of fermion degenerity is strongly dependent on the relic neutrino temperature near the cluster core , which can be as low as @xmath0 ev from the center of the cluster . for a1689<n> , it is also possible that relic neutrinos can fall to the core from the cluster halo , but the effect is marginal . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the existence of a dark matter ( dm ) halo in galaxy clusters has been a long - standing puzzle . in the standard model ,<n> the dm particles are assumed to be massive , neutral , and noninteracting @xcite . however , recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wmap satellite and the anisotropy measurements in the x - ray band by the hess collaboration ( see e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein ) , as well as measurements of the density profile of the cluster of galaxies obtained by gravitational lensing , @xmath0 , shows a clear central peak .<n> the x - ray emission is integrated along the light of sight , so that the effect of the plasma particles on the cluster mass should be minor compared to that by the dark matter particles . however , the plasma temperature profile has a singularity near the 3d center of the clusters , implying that the fermion / neutrino hypothesis should be tested observationally with future - coming cluster profiles , modeled by a fixed set of particle properties and by a varied set of the central density . <n> the degeneracy of relic massive neutrinos implies that not all of them could have behaved as collisionless dark matter , a hypothesis that has important implications for  free streaming '' in the universe . in the standard cosmological model ,<n> collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) and collisionless light fermions ( lfs ) are the dominant components of dark matter and baryonic mass , respectively , in galaxy clusters @xcite . since the cdm particles are cold , they decouple from each other , and the lf s are collisionless the mass profile at the center of the cluster of galaxies , a1689 , is reproduced by models assuming the presence of degenerate fermionic dark matter . in the case that the dark matter consists of the mixture of the degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles , the mass range of neutrinos is between 1 and 2 ev , if the ratio of the two kinds of dark matter particle is fixed to its cosmic value . both the pure fermion dark matter models and neutrino -

hubbard model of two interacting particles in the presence of a confining potential . for a system of two isotropic and noninteracting particles , such as in the quantum hall regime , a perturbative approach based on the bethe -

lifshitz force between two parallel metallic plates separated by a distance @xmath0 , as a function of their separation .<n> we show that the force between the two plates is proportional to the product of the force density between the plates and the energy of the two polarization modes of the electromagnetic field . for large separations ,<n> the force is proportional , up to a constant factor , to the energy squared between the polarization modes . in the limit of small separations<n> , the force behaves as if it were a classical force , independent of the polarizations of the fields . <n> the classical casimir effect@xcite describes the force experienced by a gas of atoms when irradiated by a monochromatic electromagnetic field of uniform intensity ; it has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically over the past half - century , and is one of the most important results of quantum mechanics . the classic casimir problem , in which the atoms are attracted to each other by a force proportional to their separation @xcite , is the simplest example of a problem in which quantum effects play a crucial role . since the original formulation by casimir in the 1950 s@xmath1 we study the casimir -

linear , non - convex , and non - hermitian hamiltonian problem , which can not be solved by standard methods of asymptotic analysis . on the other hand , in the last years considerable progress has been made in the understanding of transport properties in the regime of strong interactions , i.e. in the so -

time fourier transform of the riemannian manifold . in this<n> regard , it has been intensively studied since the early days of quantum mechanics , particularly in connection with the schrdinger equation . while the exact martingale has been known since the middle of the twentieth century , its exact form has been a subject of debate since then , and it was only recently that approximate martingales have been found for a class of _ non - commutative _ operators , i.e. , operators that are _ not _ fredholmian invariant , but that are nevertheless _<n> gaussian_. this class of operators includes , among others , many physical systems , including , for example , quantum optics , where we show that the wigner function of a stochastic markov process can be approximated by an @xmath0-martingale .<n> the martingale is obtained by considering the conditional expectation of a functional of the process , which can be obtained as a weak form of the infinitesimal generator of the markovian process . <n> markov processes are one of the most studied models in the theory of stochastic processes @xcite . in stochastic processes ,<n> the markov operator is given by a probability measure on the space of probability measures , and the process is defined by a sequence of markov functionals , each of which has a probability distribution that depends on the state of the system and on the initial distribution of the processes . as a consequence , in the thermodynamic limit<n> , the process converges to a stationary distribution , while the mean - square displacement of the particles diverges . on the other hand , stochastic processes are not stationary , because their mean - squared displacements ( msds ) converge to a finite value as the process goes to infinity . to describe the behavior of a process in a thermodynamic limit , one has to consider the so -

called _ quantum spin liquids _ , where the spin degrees of freedom are incompressible , and the low - energy excitations are gapped . in this context<n> , it is of interest to understand the properties of the quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) , which is a new quantum state of matter , consisting of a spin 1/2 fermi liquid and a spin 3/2 antiferromagnet , in which the exchange coupling between the two spin components is quantized , but the exchange interaction between the fermions is finite . the ground - state energy @x we construct a @xmath0-martingale for the lifshitz - schwinger operator on a hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .<n> we show strong convergence of thisgale to its limit . <n> [ [ section ] ] in this paper , we study a martingale that arises in the calculation of the l ifshitz schwinger equation ( lse ) for a fermionic system with a periodic boundary condition . in @xcite ,<n> the lse is defined for fermions confined to the half - line of a periodic lattice and interacting via a quartic interaction : it is called the l - l se equation and it appears in the definition of the hamiltonian in the fundamental representation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , see e.g. refs . [ eqs : inf - fs ] and references therein . here<n> we deal with the case when the boundary condition of the system is given by a periodic function of time , i.e. , the gaussian form of the boundary conditions is the same as in the non - interacting case : we will use the martingale formalism to calculate the l se we prove that wigner transforms of oscillatory integrals of the form @xmath0 are small in the oscillatory parameter space , that is , in the space of wigner - type transforms .<n> this is true even if the function in question is smooth . <n> the wigner transform is one of the most important tools in the theory of harmonic oscillators . in @xcite<n> , it was used to derive a new integral representation for the eigenfunctions of a harmonic oscillator , which turned out to be very useful in the analysis of the behavior of the latter in the non - linear regime . as a consequence of this integral representation ,<n> it was also possible to derive an integral representation of the energy eigenvalues of the oscillator in the nonlinear regime , a result that is important in the study of the dynamics of oscillators in nonlinear systems . since the derivation of the integral representation<n> : ( i ) there has been a lot of work on approximations to wigner s transform , ( ii ) it has been important to understand the effect of approximations on the properties of the transform and ( iii ) the results obtained have been very useful for the understanding of nonlinear dynamics we prove that the limit of the second moment of a sequence @xmath0 $ ] is deterministic and that it is uniquely determined by a transport equation . <n> time reversal invariance is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics .<n> it was introduced by schrdinger in @xcite and has been intensively studied in the last years . in particular , it plays an important role in the theory of phase conjugation , which has been experimentally demonstrated in the context of acoustic time reversal devices . the time reversal mirror ( trm )<n> is a device that measures the phase of a wave and records the time difference between two interfering waves , one of which is acousto - optic and the other an acoustic . for the trm to work ,<n> it is necessary that the phase difference between the two waves must be quantized , that is , the system must have a non - vanishing phase difference with the first wave . here<n> , we present a new proof of the time - reversal - invariance of a system with time reversal symmetry : we show that a trm is deterministic if and only if its phase difference is quantized and if the transport equation characterizing the dynamics of the system is known .",

neutral - current ( a - ic ) neutrinos from dark matter ( dm ) annihilations in the deepcore of the icecube neutrino telescope .<n> we report the results of measuring a cascade event in addition to the track events in order to derive the most stringent limits on dm annihilation cross section with isothermal or cusped dm density profiles around the green bank ( gc ) . by combining these results with the results from other experiments ,<n> we obtain the 95% confidence level ( cl ) bounds on the dm - nucleon cross section @xmath0 ev / c@xmath1 at 90% cl , which are more stringent than the existing limits from t2k and icecube experiments . <n> one of the major goals of neutrino telescopes is to search for a leptonic signature of dark matter @xcite . in the case of atmospheric neutrinos<n> , it is expected that the dominant flavor of neutrinos are the tau neutrinos , whose cross section is almost the same for all flavors . on the other hand , for dm we perform a systematic search for dark - matter annihilations into dark - energy particles ( dm ) with the icecube deepcore detector .<n> we find no evidence for the presence of dm in the energy range of @xmath0 gev , and set the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) upper limit on the dm - nucleon annihilation cross section @xcite at the 90% c. l. for a low - mass supersymmetric particle ( wimp ) , the cross section is constrained to be @ x@xmath1 , which is a factor of 10 less than the current upper limit from wmap7 + act data . in the mass range from 10 gev to the threshold of annihilation , we find the cross sections are constrained at the level of @ xmath2 . we also find no significant evidence for dm annihilation into light quarks or leptons , in contrast to the results from other experiments , such as icecube + wmap , act , fermi - lat , dsphs , _ fermi_-lat , etc .. in order to obtain more stringent constraints , it is important to compare our results with weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are candidates for dark matter ( dm ) . if wimps are the dominant energy reservoir in the early universe , dm annihilation or decay into various final states can produce a continuous gamma - ray spectrum .<n> we constrain the cross section of wimp annihilation / decay into a variety of final states using a combination of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements , diffuse gamma - rays from dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way , and constraints from fermi - lat observations . in the case of annihilation into @xmath0 final states , we find that the deepcore detector at the galactic center ( gc ) is competitive with current and future ground - based detectors . on the other hand , for annihilation into a @x <n> 1 final state , the deep core detector has a better chance to be sensitive to this channel , since it is expected to produce less diffuse gamma rays . <n> the energy injection from dark matter into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at high redshift can affect the structure formation process of the igm and modify the standard recombination history of the universe @xcite . the energy injected we present the latest constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , gamma - ray observations of dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way , and neutrino flux from dark matter cascades .<n> the cmb constraint is stronger than the recent act 2008 result by a factor of @xmath0 , which could be tested by the icecube deepcore detector . <n> the annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) into standard model particles ( sparticles ) can lead to the production of neutrinos with energies up to a few tev , depending on the dm mass and the direction of the annihilation site . in this talk<n> , we will present the recent constraints on dm annihilation cross sections from cmb and gamma ray observations , respectively , as well as the recent results on the neutrino signature from dm decays from cascade events in icecube , a large - scale detector currently under construction in the mediterranean sea . at present , the only direct probe of dm physics is from neutrino oscillation experiments , such as icecube - ii @xcite , superkamiokande -

lat s constraint on gamma rays is stronger than the expected deepcore sensitivity with dm mass in this mass range . for comparison , we also show that the neutrino signature from the dm annihilations can be detected at the expected significance in five years for track and cascade events in satellite galaxies . <n> 0.5 cm the existence of non - baryonic dark matter has been a long - standing goal of particle physics and cosmology @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,<n> the predicted dm density is proportional to the mass of the lightest cp - even neutralino , which is the lightest dm particle in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) with three generations of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking mass terms . if the sm is non -

energy grbs observed by pamela ( grb 021211 , 3c273 and 3c345 ) , and by icecube ( icecube - ii ) and show that they are in good agreement with the predictions of the standard model of particle physics . <n> [ [ section ] ] the discovery of the first grbs @xcite , followed by the measurements of their energy and flux by the fermi and pamela experiments , has been one of the most important developments in particle physics of the last two decades . at present , this is the largest collection of grbs ever recorded , with more than 800 events detected by fermi - lat and more than 2000 events by ice cube - ii ( i.e. , more than half of the total number of events reported so far )<n> . however , it is not icecube and fermi - lat have measured the flux of gravitational waves ( gws ) produced by the sun , moon , and mars with unprecedented accuracy .<n> the gw signal from the sun has been measured with high accuracy for the first time , @xmath0 , while the fluxes from the mars and icecube satellites have been measured at much lower precision : @xcite . in this letter<n> , we present the results of the analysis of the data from icecube , which provides the first gw flux measurement from a single satellite , as well as the results from the fermi space telescope , for which the data cover the full sky . <n> icecube is a cube - shaped detector with a sensitive polarimeter , consisting of an array of plastic scintillators and a water cherenkov detector . from the data ,<n> we measure a gw - flux of @ x - ray / uv photons @x<n> . we also measure the fluxes of other gw signals , such as gravitational waves produced by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , quasars , radio pulsars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) we present a new constraint on the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath0 , based on the measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy by the fermi - lat experiment .<n> we find that the eos must be very close to zero at high redshift , which is consistent with the very stringent lower bound on the ratio of the reheating temperature to the hubble expansion rate . at low redshifts ,<n> the cmb anisotropic temperature is well below the critical temperature for the formation of the first oscillators and the first stars , and thus the anistropy of the primordial power spectrum is very small . on the other hand , if the dark eos is close to the maximal eos value , then the temperature of the oscillators is very sensitive to the dark matter properties , such as mass , scale and clustering . <n> the primordial cmb power spectrum @xcite is a direct probe of the properties of the early universe . in its simplest form<n> , the primordial spectrum is a power - law function of the redshift with a spectral index of -2.3 , where the spectral index @x we consider the sommerfeld mechanism in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( gut ) . in these theories ,<n> the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the presence of a non - abelian gauge symmetry .<n> we show that the mechanism can lead to supersymmetry breaking in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a spontaneously broken susy @xmath0 gauge symmetry at the gut scale . as a result , sparticle masses , gauge couplings and the masses of the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) are predicted to be in the tev range . <n> supersymmetry ( sugra ) @xcite is one of the most attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) due to its naturalness , stability , and compatibility with all known particle physics phenomena . among the simplest sugra models , the simplest one which naturally gives rise to gauge coupling unification ( gm unification ) is the so - called susy@xcite ( ss@xmath1 ) susy gut , which is a supersymmetric extension of the su(5 ) gauge group we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be written as the sum of a positive constant and a negative energy - dependent term .<n> the former is related to the energy - dependence of the eos and the latter is due to the fact that in the presence of the negative energy term , the dark - energy - driven eos undergoes a smooth transition from the cosmological constant - driven to the radiation - driven regime . as a result ,<n> this eos can be expressed in terms of a single function , which can be computed easily . <n> dark energy is the dominant component of the universe s energy budget , accounting for about one - third of the energy density of our universe . in the standard model of particle physics<n> , it is assumed that the universe consists of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) component , a baryonic component and an invisible matter component . however , recent observations indicate that our universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion driven by a large scale structure formation @xcite . to explain the observed accelerated expansion , dark energy models , in which the universe is described by a spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - we propose a new dark energy model , in which the dark energy is sourced by a scalar field .<n> the scalar field is a dark matter candidate , called the quintessence field , which can decay into the dark matter and dark energy . in this paper<n> , we study the dark sector of this model and we show that this model can account for the daya - bay , t2k and double - chooz dark energy measurements . <n> the existence of dark energy ( de ) is one of the most important puzzles in particle physics today . while it is generally accepted that the energy density of the universe is dominated by dark matter ( dm ) ,<n> the origin of this energy is still a matter of debate @xcite . to explain the dm energy density , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics<n> is based on the idea of  dark energy '' , i.e. the energy that can not be explained by dm but can be supplied by some other source ( e.g. , dark matter , supersymmetric particles , ... ) in a non - negligible fraction of the total energy budget . on the other hand  we propose a new method to measure the cosmic ray electron ( @xmath0 ) energy spectrum based on the measurement of the energy spectrum of the @ x - ray flux at the earth s surface .<n> we show that this method can be more efficient than the traditional direct detection technique , and that it is complementary to the _ gzk _ and _ icecube _ experiments . <n> cosmic rays ( crs ) are the most abundant component of the universe , responsible for about one quarter of the total energy budget of the observed universe @xcite . at the same time , they are one of the least studied particles , due to the difficulty of their detection and the lack of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their origin and propagation . in the standard model of particle physics ,<n> crs are described by an electron - positron ( e - p ) pair spectrum with a mass of the order of 10 ev and a width of a few ev ( see , e.g. , ref . * 1 * , for a summary ) . however , recent observations of high - energy cosmic rays have revealed a number of possible origins , including dark matter @x annihilations of dark matter ( dm ) in the early universe produce a distinctive spectral signature in the cosmic gamma - ray sky .<n> this spectral signature can be used to constrain the properties of the dm annihilation products , such as their mass , density , and total energy . in this letter<n> , we discuss the possibility that the annihilation products of dm particles with a mass @xmath0 gev , a total energy of the order of 10@xmath1 tev and an annihilation cross section @xcite of a few percent of the wimp - mass threshold can account for the high - energy spectra of cosmic gamma rays and neutrinos observed by fermi - lat , icecube and other experiments . <n> the detection of high energy cosmic rays ( crs ) from the sun , the earth and the moon is one of the most important scientific goals of the present day , as they provide us with a direct probe of the very early universe , when the universe was only one degree of freedom away from being completely ionized . to this end ,<n> a large number of detectors have been built or are in the process of being built , with the latest being the icecube the km3net experiment is designed to study ice physics at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .<n> it consists of a @xmath0 km@xmath1 triangular ice sheet , surrounded by a km3 network of superconducting wires and chambers , which allows for high - speed and high - efficiency tracking of particle events . in this report<n> , we present the design of the icecube tracking system , and report on the performance of the various sub - systems . <n> ice physics is one of the major physics goals of the lhc @xcite , as it offers the possibility to explore the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the hot and dense medium created in the collision of heavy nuclei at high energy density . at lhc energies ,<n> the energy density of the qgp is expected to be of the order of 1tev per nucleon - nucleon collision , an energy regime which has not been reached yet at the tevatron and rhic colliders , but which is within the reach of the next generation of neutrino telescopes such as icecube , km3 and even the kilometre - scale neutrino telescope ",

a dart : its position in the space of k - links ; an end : the end of the dart ; and a _ destructor _ which removes the latest k - link from the state . here<n> we are interested in the topology of the set of all orbit - structures of a quantum system @x in this paper , we introduce a new class of free maps , which we call _ hyper - dart maps _ , and prove some fundamental properties of them .<n> in particular , they are exactly equipped with the so - called _ invariant _<n> : fixpoint . <n> _ keywords : _ dart , free map , hypermap , fixed point , traversal . -.3<n> cm -.2 cm the study of the dynamics of objects is one of the main motivations of the theory of dynamical systems @xcite . in recent years<n> , a great deal of progress has been achieved in this field , both in theory and in practice . on the one hand ,<n> the dynamical systems theory has proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis of large dynamical systems , thanks to its ability to deal with both small and large scales . at the same time , however , there is a lack of general results on the asymptotic behavior of free dynamical systems under small perturbations of the objects under consideration , in spite of the fact that such perturbations can be taken into account in a very natural way , e.g. , by in this paper , we present a new method to test if there exists a path from a dart to another in an orbit for a hypermap permutation .<n> the method is based on sigfs of type sigf @xmath0 , @xcite . the euler formula and the genus theorem are obtained as corollaries of the fact that euler s characteristic ec is even and satisfies 2 * ( nc m ) > = ( ecm ) @xcite . remark that - > denotes a functional type in set as well as an implication in prop : definition ec(m : fmap ) : z:= nv m + ne m + nf m - nd m . definition genus(m:m:fmap)- ( ) - ( _ ec m : _ z t = t , nd ) definition genus ( m:_ec m)_(_n , nc m)= _ ( qc m)__@xcite @xmath0 we now count cells and components of a hypermap using the coq library zarith containing all the features of z , the integer ring , including tools to solve linear systems in presburger s arithmetics .<n> the numbers nd and nv of darts , edges , vertices , faces and components are easily defined by induction . finally , a binary relation eqc stating that two we prove a constructive criterion of planarity , when one correctly _ links _ with l at dimensions @xmath0 or @xcite .<n> a consequence of the previous theorems is a completely constructive _ criterion of plank arity _ , _ e.g. _ for dimensions at which plankarity is _ not _ preserved . <n> planarity is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics , and plays a central role in the theory of discrete sets , in particular in the definition of the euler formula , as well as in the classification of functional types in sets . in recent years<n> , planarity has received a great deal of attention , both from the theoretical and the applied point of view . on the one hand ,<n> the planarity of a given set is a fundamental property of the set ; on the other , it is a key ingredient in the construction of new sets and of new functional types . a recent trend in the field is to study planarity as a function of dimensionality , with the aim of finding _ general _ planarity criteria , such as , for example , the genus theorem , or the in this paper , we characterize the effect of breaking a link of a planar hypermap on the _ connectivity _ of the hypermap . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction [ [ section ] ] let @xmath0 be a map .<n> a _ link _ between two planar maps is a link between two faces of the map : ( 1 ) a planar face is _ disconnected _ , _ i.e. _ there is no link between the components of m : fmap(x : dart ) ;

russell ( hr ) technique ,  bin - and - measure '' methods , as well as the hipparcos method . in this paper<n> , we present distances to a sample of 19 pne based on a new distance measurement technique that is independent of the statistical techniques used in the past . we have used the very large array ( vla ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to image the central region of the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc 6543 at a time @xmath0 yr ago , and to measure the expansion of a number of individual features within the nebula .<n> we measure the parallax of each feature due to its angular expansion , which allows us to determine the distance to this pn with high accuracy . using the well - defined , optically bright features in the central nebula as fiducials , we have accurately measured the expansion velocities of the features as a function of time . <n> we find that : ( 1 ) the  parallax '' of a feature is determined by its expansion in the direction normal to the line of sight , rather than in the normal direction as would be the case if the feature were expanding along a straight line ; ( 2 ) there is no significant difference in the expansion velocity of the feature between the two epochs ; and ( 3 ) using a spatiokinematic model of the nebula we have measured the tangential expansion velocity to be , at the 90% confidence level , ( 1@xmath we report the detection of the systematic expansion of the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc 6543 between 1994 and 1997 from archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field and planetary camera 2 (  wfpc2 '' ) narrowband images .<n> three separate astrometric analyses of these recorded images , separated by 35 months , yield three direct distance determinations for this nebula : @xmath0 pc , @x_xmath1 _ pc ( 68% confidence errors , based on a model of the nebula based on independent measurements of the doppler velocity of the central nebular features ) and _ s_@xmath2 pc ( 95% confidence )<n> . the distance to this pn is determined from a fit of the expansion pattern to a spatiokinematic model derived from independent doppler velocities of individual features , all of which are in excellent agreement . <n> the kinematic ages of features approximately scale with their angular size , providing insight into the highly organized and orchestrated mass loss history of the nucleus , presently a wolf -

mass stars ,<n> the rate of expansion is determined by the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) and the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . for a given stellar mass , there is a characteristic expansion rate that depends on the ism metallicity , the degree to which the gas is ionized and the density at which it is . at a given radius ,  universal '' values of the expansion rates are found for bhs with masses in the range @xcite . on the other hand , at any given radius the universal expansion rate for a bh with a given mass is proportional to the ratio of the we have measured the expansion rate of ngc 6240 to be @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , which corresponds to a linear expansion of the scale length @xcite .<n> the result is based on two epochs of vla observations ( 1994 and 1997 ) , as well as hst images taken in 1994 - 97 . <n> the expansion of a seyfert 1 galaxy is the result of the combined effects of stellar winds and radiation pressure from a central black hole . in the early universe , black holes with masses of 10 to 1000 solar masses<n> are found to expand at a rate of @x <n> @ x -

to - noise ratios in the residuals after the images of two epochs are subtracted , and it assumes no change in surface brightness or nebular shape . the random errors appear to be dominated by photon statistics . <n> radial fitting '' allows the positions of bright nebular features along 1-d flux profiles to be measured by performing gaussian fits , by evaluating the flux - weighted centroid of a fiducial s peak , or by graphically measuring the shift of a sharp edge in each of the two eras . this method has a somewhat increased potential for yielding expansion estimates for nebular  features '' that are too faint for similar measurements with the profile method . we take the uncertainty in expansion measurement along an individual profile to be ( 1 ) the difference between expansion rates inferred from the corresponding features on opposite sides of the nucleus , ( 2 )the unweighted mean and standard deviation of multiple cuts intersecting an extended structure , where appropriate . #<n> 1to 0 we present two epochs of _ hst_/nicmos observations of [ o iii ] @xmath0 , [ s ii]@xmath1 , and [ n ii ] emission from ngc 4258 .<n> we measure the radial expansion of each emission line feature using two methods : ( 1 ) fitting a gaussian to the sharp edges of the difference maps , ( 2 ) measuring the radial displacement at multiple positions along the steep flux dropoffs of the edges using the radial fitting method , or ( 3 ) using a magnification method to reduce the rms difference image in the regions of the bright fiducial features . <n> the first method employs iraf  geotran '' to magnify the 1994 image by various magnification factors , in the range of 1.001 to 1.005 . for radial motions with no brightness changes , a given feature will disappear in the residual image after the magnified 1994 image is subtracted from the aligned 1997 image . the advantages of the magnification method are that the intuitive pattern recognition capability and judgement of the brain can be exploited , but the residuals may uncover deviations from simple radial expansion in the complex nebula that would not easily be recognized in ngc 6543 was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the [ o iii ] @xmath0 , [ n ii]@xmath1 , and [ s ii ] emission lines .<n> we have obtained a high resolution image of the central region of the seyfert 2 galaxy ms92 with the acs in the f555w and f814w filters . in this paper<n> we describe the observations and data analysis which led to the discovery of a new , young , low mass star , , located at the center of the nebula . <n> the hst / acs images of ms 92 were used to determine the distance to the nebula in the parsec regime . using the magnification method , we were able to measure the expansion of several features in the nebula with an accuracy of @xcite . the distance ,<n> _ i.e. _ , the angular distance from the nucleus to the feature , was determined by ( 1 ) kinematic information , ( 2 ) detailed observations and ( 3 ) a spatiokinematic model used to convert radial into we present [ o iii ] , [ s ii ] and h@xmath0 images of the planetary nebulae ngc 6240 , e25 , and e105 obtained with the hubble space telescope between 1994 and 1997 .<n> the nebular structure has changed significantly in the years since the observations , but no nonradial motions have been detected . <n> we derive distance moduli of @xmath1 ( e25 and ms92 ) and @xcite ( e105 ) using three different methods : ( 1 ) nebular expansion along the minor axis of a prolate ellipsoid ; ( 2 ) residuals from the profile analysis of bright features ; and ( 3 ) magnification of the image by a small fraction of the total brightness . the distance modulus derived from e25<n> is found to be consistent with that derived from the doppler velocity mapping of ms93 , indicating that the distance to e25 is less than 50 pc , in good agreement with the value derived for e105 from the same data . in the course of our work , we have also discovered a new planetary nebula , ic 348 , with a we report the discovery of the first protoplanetary nebulae ( pne ) in the milky way .<n> the young ( @xmath0 yr ) planetary nebulae are embedded in a circumstellar disk whose major axis is oriented nearly perpendicular to the plane of the disk and whose minor axis is approximately aligned with the axis of elongation of the planetary nebula . using the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ,<n> we have obtained [ o iii ] and [ s ii ] images of the pne and have measured their expansion velocities , distances , and luminosities . <n> pne are found in two classes : ( 1 ) prolate ellipsoids ( pes ) and ( 2 ) tilted circular rings ( tcrs ) , both of which are interpreted as prolate spheroids ( or ellipsoid - like structures ) with tilted minor axes . in the case of e105<n> , the minor axis of the tilted circular ring is offset from the major axis , which may indicate that the ring is tilted with respect to the line of sight . for both e25 and e105 , we find that the expansion of we present high -

resolution images of these two objects , as well as images of three others , obtained with the adaptive optics system on the keck ii telescope : e105 ( m100 ) , e25 ( m50 ) and e125 ( s105 )<n> . we also present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the three lensed galaxies using the multi - object , multi - slit spectrograph on the gemini north telescope . the high - quality images and spectra allow us to measure the expansion velocities and radial velocities of the cores in each galaxy . for each galaxy<n> we derive the distance , the expansion rate and the kinematic age the core of ngc 6543 is a highly elongated ( @xmath0 ) elliptical galaxy ( eo ) .<n> the eo has a kinematic age of at least 3 gyr , making it the oldest known galaxy in the universe . in this paper<n> we report the results of a three - year program of high - resolution , high - s / n echelle spectroscopy of the oe . <n> the data show that the material is expanding at a constant rate , that the expansion velocity is a few hundred km s@xmath1 , and that the bulk of the material has a decelerated expansion rate . the large kinematic age , combined with the deceleration and with the uniform expansion law , suggests that the eso oe is coeval with a hubble law age of @xcite 5 gyr and thus has been in place for at least 4 gyr<n> . however , there are several potential problems with the kinematic age estimate , which are discussed in the paper . ngc 6543 is one of the best known examples of a planetary nebula ( pn ) with a young stellar population .<n> it was the first pn to be discovered , and its kinematics are among the youngest in the pn community . in this paper<n> , we report the results of a three - year _ hubble space telescope _<n> program designed to study the kinematics of a well - studied , young , planetary nebula . <n> we have obtained wfpc2 images of the [ o iii ] and [ s ii ] pn polar caps , as well as of the nebula s central star . from these data ,<n> we determine the kinematic ages of the polar caps to be @xmath01.8@xmath00.3 gyr for [ oiii ] ( @xcite : 1  rm yr$ ] for a distance of 10 pc ) and to be 6.70@x 01.37 gyr in the case of [s ii](@xcite:2 ) , where the errors in the ages are dominated by measurement errors . for the first time  we report the discovery of polar jets and condensations in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 .<n> the images were obtained with the hubble space telescope s wide field and planetary camera 2 in the [ o iii ] and [ s ii ] emission lines , and with the gemini south 8 m telescope in the near - infrared . <n> the high angular resolution of the observations ( @xmath0400 mas ) allows us to resolve a number of interesting features , the most striking of which is the appearance of a large number of condensations around the nucleus . in particular , we have detected the signature of angular expansion from the polar caps of the major axis of e25 , as well as the condensations and polar jets around j@xmath1 , s2 and s3 . we also report the detection of several new condensations , jets and polar caps , some of which have no counterparts in the archival wfpc2 images and others which have not been detected before in nicmos or with the hst wide field camera 2 ( wfc2 ) . as a by - product of our study ,<n> we have discovered a number we have observed ngc 6543 in the [ o iii ] @xmath09,5007 lines with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 .<n> we have measured the proper motions of the stars and nebular emission lines , as well as the expansion rates of the nebular gas . based primarily on e25 we have determined a distance of 1001@xmath0269 pc , consistent with previous distance determinations . <n> # 1_#1 _ # 1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in we have used the planetary camera ( pc ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to measure the proper motion of ngc 6543 , one of the most complex planetary nebulae ( pn ) in the sky .<n> proper motions of 0.25 pixels , or about 12 mas with the pc camera , have been measured with errors of order 20% when the signal is strong . we present a new interpretation of the geometry of the planetary nebula ngc 6543 , based on new high resolution , high signal - to - noise wfpc2 images and new slit spectroscopy .<n> the nebular core is dominated by a prolate ellipsoid with numerous small , irregular , and compact  bulges . ''<n> the  tips '' of the ellipsoids are @xmath0 from the major axis on either side of the symmetry axis of the nebula . <n> the central ellipsoidal feature , e25 , is a  closed prolate ellipse , '' and its inner edges are approximately delineated by the caps and the projected tips of e105 along its minor axis . in our model<n> e25 is a coherent structure , with two roughly - spherical , conjoined  bubbles '' at its waists , which form an ensemble which we denote an  conjoined bubble '' . both e25 and the conjoined bubbles<n> have sharp edges which are nearly unresolved . if they are old or older , then they are free to relax ( expand ) at their internal sound speed of 10 km s@xmath6 then they would be we present _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of the core of ngc 6543 in 1994 , 1997 , and 1999 .<n> the core is a very young ( @xmath0 yr old ) , low excitation ( n(h@xmath1 ) = 2 - 3 ) planetary nebula . <n> the nebula is dominated by a bright , central core , or shell , which has been displaced and swept up by the outward flow of a wind heated , thermally expanding bubble . the leading shell seems to have developed thin - shell instabilities or lumps of small amplitude during its evolution . this happens because the outward flows of the thermally - driven expanding bubble surface encounters dense regions upstream and bends around them , forming surface lumps . ( however , the scale of the lumps is too small to allow studies of their individual expansion patterns . in 3.2 )<n> we show that the growth patterns of the cores of several nearby , young planetary nebulae provide a very interesting and useful glimpse into the physics of their formation and evolution , as we discuss next . we present hst wfpc2 images of three planetary nebulae , ngc 5882 , 6826 , and 6884 , taken in 1994 and 1997 .<n> the nebulae have figure - eight shaped morphologies , with the figure eight of @xmath0 carinae being the least elongated of the three . <n> two of the objects are in the middle of their main lobes , while the third is in a pair of figure - seven lobes . in all three nebulae<n> we find that the shape of the object with the largest expansion rate is that of a prolate ellipsoid ; however , it is not a thermally - expanding bubble . instead , the shape is consistent with the combined expansion of two bubbles that are either older or more decelerated than e25 , or both . for the three objects ,<n> the expansion of the prolate shape is more uniform than that of the elongated shape , which is generally believed to be the consequence of a high - pressure waist of confining material that forces the thermally expanding bubble to grow most rapidly along the direction orthogonal to the disk ( _ e.g. _ , icke , et al . we present _ hubble space telescope _<n> ( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 images of the planetary nebulae e25 , e105 , and ngc 6543 .<n> e25 is a prolate , wind - driven ellipsoid whose tips appear to have been displaced and accreted considerable amounts of gas with lower specific momentum and have been decelerated . alternatively the gas behind the tips may have cooled adiabatically , so the thermal pressure driving the expansion has abated . _ conjoined bubbles _ almost certainly represent the projected edges of a pair of bubble - like shells conjoined along their waist . along its waist a ruffle and slightly irregular series of ragged low - ionization , elongated knots ( e105)which seem to point away from the nucleus . we present hst wfpc2 @xmath0 images of ngc 6543 .<n> the images show two symmetric pairs of shell - like objects , conjoined along their waists , with projected separations of about 1 au . <n> the two pairs have a similar kinematic age within our error bars ( dwarkadas & balick 1998 ) . based on the increasing kinematic age with radial distance from the nucleus ,<n> it appears that e25 is overtaking some of the more distant nebular regions such as the tips of e25 and the caps d - d@xmath1 . in the context of a simple hydrodynamic model<n> , this suggests that the star ejected about 1000 yr ago a pulse of material which now forms the conjoined bubbles . about 1000<n> yr ago , the star ejection event ejected material which is now in the form of conjoined shells . we present high - resolution , long - slit observations of ngc 6543 in the @xmath0 band .<n> we find that the central star is variable on timescales as short as a few hours , and that it is variable in the rest of the nebula on timescales from a few to a few hundred years . <n> the variable star , g191-b2 , is the central component of the planetary nebulae , a group of about 30 objects formed by the merger of a large number of planetary - mass stars ( perinotto , cerruti - sola & lamers 1989 ) . in the last 20 years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the variable component of this planetary nebula , due in part to the discovery of a new class of variable stars ,  variable b - stars '' : low - mass , low - luminosity stars whose light curves vary in time and space , but in which the period of the oscillations is much greater than the characteristic time scale of the stars . the variable stars are seen in nebular spectra from the ultraviolet to the near - infrared . here<n> we present the results of a _ hubble space telescope _<n> we have used _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 images , obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 , to measure the optical expansion parallax of the planetary nebula ngc 6543 .<n> the parallax is used to determine the distance to the nebula of 1001@xmath0269 pc , determine the kinematic age of the brightest parts of the nebula , and to investigate the evolution of nebular features . the ongoing go 7501 expansion parallax program of 30 planetary nebulae ( pne ) has selected 30 pne for wfpc2 expansion parallax observations . here<n> we report the kinematic age of the brightest inner parts of the core of the nebula , based on three measurements along the minor axis of the tilted prolate ellipsoid e25 , is 1039@xmath0259 yr .<n> the outer regions , which resemble a pair of conjoined bubbles with a large waist , have longer kinematic ages . <n> # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in .125 in<n> .25 in the ongoing go 7501 program has selected 30 planetary nebulae ( pne ) for wfpc2 observations for its ongoing multi -

known e5 nebula . we present the results of a study of the stellar dynamics of a sample of four luminous x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , harrington , casertano e25 minor , and f502n , which have masses of @xmath01.8 , 7 , 9 , 5403 , respectively .<n> we find that the masses of the blue supergiants ( bsgs ) in these systems are in the range 10@xmath1 - 10@ xmath2 , while the red supergiant ( rsg ) masses range from 8 to 15 , depending on the mass of the central black hole . in the case of harrington<n> s system , we do not find any evidence for supermassive black holes , but the data are consistent with the black holes having masses of 10 - 12 xmath3 . for the caserntino e25 major ,<n> the data show evidence for black hole masses of 8 - 10 xmath4 . <n> there is a general trend of increasing black hole mass with stellar mass in the lmxb sample . from observations of rsgs @xcite<n> , it has been shown that the x - ngc 6543 is one of the best known examples of a planetary nebula ( pn ) that is both a pn and a polar cap nebula .<n> it was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in 1994 and 1997 and has been re -

flexible walls of linear extension of the form @xcite .<n> we find that subdiffusion of this form occurs for all values of the particle radius . for particles larger than some 10 <n> kd in living cells , this subd iffusion is due to molecular crowding , the excluded volume effect in the superdense cellular environment . in this case<n> we obtain the following results : ( i ) for particles of radius 10 , we find anomalous diffusion for all times , with the exponent of anomalous diffusion in time , for which the mean squared displacement , @math2 , follows @math3 , and the embedding spatial dimension is smaller than the physical dimension , by a factor of order unity ; ( ii ) in the case of particles of size 10 ) , subdifffusion occurs for time intervals of the order of 10@xmath4 s , corresponding to times of order of order 10 s between the particles interactions with the semiflexible walls of the medium . <n> ( iii ) we find the subdiffusion due to excluded volume crowding in biological cells and other complex fluids is ubiquitous . here<n> we discuss the properties of continuous time random walk processes with diverging characteristic waiting time with respect to their time averaged behaviour .<n> we show that for free motion the lag time dependence of the time averaged mean squared displacement , @xmath0 , is insensitive to the anomalous diffusion exponent for ctrw processes . in contrast , for confined ctrh subd iffusion a universal scaling behaviour emerges , with dynamic exponent @xcite , which is in contrast to the universal gaussian nature of brownian motion which is effected by the central limit theorem . <n> we particularly discuss the scaling of the characteristic time under confinement , and the saturation properties under confinement of the scaling behaviour , of the subdiffusive processes governed by continuous time and fractional brownian motions , respectively . for continuous time<n> random walk subdaffusion governed by anomalous diffusion is universal , as the associated probability density is no longer necessarily gaussian . at the same time<n> the very nature of the anomalous diffusive process may result in decisively different behaviours for diffusional mixing and diffusion - limited reactions , implying significant differences for subdiffusion governed by continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) give rise to an ensemble averaged mean squared displacement , @xmath0 . in the case of unbounded motion ,<n> the scaling exponent for the time averaged mean square displacement is given by the dynamic exponent , while in the limit of confined confinement the exponent is fixed by the confining potential .<n> we show that the time averages are irreproducible and their associated scatter around the ensemble mean is characterised by the distribution function of the amplitude of the time average . for confined anomalous diffusion<n> we find that this distribution is a good characteristic for the underlying process , even for relatively short trajectories , and that it is not typical for subdiffusive fbm processes . <n> _ keywords _ : random walk , diffusion processes , fractional diffusion , motion on fractals , particle motion we consider the motion of a particle in a fluctuating medium .<n> we assume that the fluctuations of the particle s direction of motion are random , and that the particle is subject to subdiffusion , i.e. , the motion is subdiffusive , but the waiting time distribution is scale - free , causing effects such as ageing and weak ergodicity breaking . on a lattice of spacing @xmath0 , we find that the average particle trajectory is characterised by an anomalous diffusion constant that is anomalous in a scale - invariant way , with a scaling factor that is a function of the average anomalous diffusion exponent . in the unbiased case , where the variance of the jump lengths is given by a finite value , anomalous diffusion is absent . for the case of an isotropic distribution of waiting times ,<n> the average waiting time diverges in the limit of large waiting time , leading to the concept of ageing . <n> we consider motion in fluctuating media , in particular , particle motion in random actin networks , charge carrier motion in amorphous semiconductors , tracer motion in groundwater , as well as in a variety of other stochastic physical systems @xcite . here , we show that the motion of a particle under the action of random fractional gaussian noise is subject to stochastic stalling and antipersistence .<n> this is demonstrated for brownian motion ( fbm ) and continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) . in the case of fbm<n> we find that the average squared displacement does not depend on the type of subdiffusion , while the waiting time distribution may be related to a comb model or a random energy landscape . for ct<n>rw the motion is dominated by the usual hurst exponent : @xmath0 ; for fbm the anomalous diffusion exponent is typically smaller than 1 . <n> random processes are ubiquitous in physics , biology , chemistry , and engineering . despite their ubiquity<n> , there is no consensus on the underlying physical mechanism that underlies their behaviour : for example , it is not yet clear whether random walks are random , random thermodynamics , or a combination of the two @xcite . however , a common feature is that they are driven by noise , which may be additive , fractional or continuous . as a result ,<n> the properties of the noise - driven motion depend on anomalous diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , appearing in a wide range of physical , chemical , biological , and socio - economic systems .<n> we show that the motion of an overdamped two - dimensional particle under the influence of a fluctuating external field can be described by a generalised langevin equation , in which the coupling between the particle motion and the external noise is mediated by the fluctuations in the drift velocity . in the presence of such noise ,<n> the particle undergoes subdiffusion with a mean squared displacement that diverges as @xmath0 , while persistent noise leads to superdiffusive behaviour with @xcite . <n> anomalous diffusion , that is , the relative motion of a particle between two potential wells , is ubiquitous in nature and has been associated with a wide variety of physical processes , such as the storage capacity of water reservoirs , market dynamics , single file diffusion and elastic models , as well as motion of biopolymers under crowding conditions . yet , despite its ubiquity , diffusion is often not understood in terms of a single physical process . here<n> we present a general framework for the description of anomalous diffusion by introducing the concept of a drift velocity @x anomalous diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in physics , chemistry , and biology .<n> we show that both brownian and continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) subdiffusion on an infinite domain exhibit anomalous diffusion . in the brownian limit<n> we derive an analytical expression for the time averaged mean squared displacement in terms of the variance of the jump lengths , @xmath0 , the lag time , _<n> i.e. _ the time it takes for a jump to appear at a given time in the infinite domain . for time - dependent waiting times , we find that the diffusion constant is a decreasing function of the time lag , rather than an increasing function as in the case of brownian motion . <n> anomalous diffusion has been observed in a wide variety of physical systems , ranging from single molecules to ensembles of biopolymers @xcite , to single file diffusion in the presence of crowding conditions in the surrounding medium , or to the relative motion of single molecules in a cell @x<n> . diffusion may be anomalous in the sense that it can not be characterized by a constant diffusion constant , but rather by a time dependence of the form , [ an_coff ] the diffusion of a particle in a medium with an anomalously distributed waiting time distribution is studied .<n> we find that the diffusion coefficient of the anomalous subdiffusive process diverges as function of the overall measurement time , in contrast to the normal case , where the mean time between jump events remains unaffected by the anomalous nature of the process . for normal diffusion ,<n> the time dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient also diverges , consistent with the ageing property of this anomalous subdiffusion . <n> a particle diffusing under the influence of an external force may jump out of a fixed position , or jump back , depending on the direction of the force applied . in the latter case<n> , the diffusion process is known as anomalous diffusion @xcite , and has been studied extensively , both experimentally @xmath0 and theoretically @x<n> . anomalous diffusion may arise in a variety of situations , ranging from diffusion of particles in a fluid environment to the dynamics of biological cells . while in the former case the diffusion is due to the diffusivity of the fluid , for the latter it arises from the anomalous distribution of the waiting times between the diffusing particle s jump events , which is often scale - we study the diffusion of a diffusing particle in a one - dimensional harmonic potential with trapping potential .<n> the system is initially prepared in a subdiffusive regime , such that the diffusing particle appears only in the course of a time interval @xmath0 longer than the time scale of the experiment . by measuring the time dependence of the mean squared displacement of the particle in the trap , we find that this anomalous diffusion process is indistinguishable from normal diffusion . however , the diffusion coefficient is not unique , as it may depend on the waiting time distribution and on the position autocorrelation between the particle and the trap center . <n> anomalous diffusion processes are ubiquitous in a wide range of physical , chemical , and biological systems @xcite . in particular ,<n> anomalous diffusive behaviour is associated with the breaking of ergodicity , which is a prerequisite for normal diffusion to be observed . on the other hand<n> , anomalous diffusion may also be associated with non - ergodic behaviour of the system , in which case the diffusive character of the process is restored after a long time , e.g. , due to the presence of an absorbing material in the medium . here<n> we study anomalous diffusion we introduce a new class of stochastic processes , the continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) , to describe the motion of tracer particles in a cell .<n> we show that the time evolution of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement is identical to that of a tracer particle stochastically diffusing in an ensemble of free particles . however , in the presence of confinement , as in the case of biological cells , we find that the particle diffusion process is subdiffusive , with thermal values comparable to those observed in living cells . <n> _ introduction _ biological cells are often observed to be active non - equilibrium systems @xcite . in order to understand their function ,<n> it is important to understand the mechanisms by which they are driven , and how they evolve in time . for example , it is well - known that living cells are able to respond to changes in their environment , e.g. , by self - regulating their response to a changing external parameter . on the other hand , they are also able to self - organize in a way that can not be explained by a simple change of their internal state , for example by the action of a heat bath , @x we consider a system of confined brownian particles , driven by white gaussian noise .<n> we show that the ensemble averaged position - position correlation in an arbitrary confining potential decays algebraically , @xmath0 , towards the ensemble average mean squared displacement . in the limit of large time separation ,<n> the latter vanishes , while the first and second boltzmann moments of the position autocorrelation decay to zero . <n> pacs numbers : 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r , 05.60.-k , 87.18.sn _ introduction : _ confinement is a ubiquitous phenomenon in physics , chemistry , biology and social sciences @xcite , and it plays a central role in many phenomena , ranging from the motion of cells in cytoskeletal networks to the dynamics of blood flow @x<n> . however , confinement is not the only aspect of confinement that is studied in these systems . here , we present a new approach to study the collective behaviour of confined particles : we consider brownian motion of a collection of particles in an external confining potential . we demonstrate that , despite the confinement , the process is non - we present a theoretical analysis of the time evolution of a brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential well or in a box potential .<n> we show that the mean squared displacement exhibits a power - law growth at short lag times , i.e. , a saturation toward the plateau of the ensemble averaged displacement . only when the lag time @xmath0 approaches the overall measurement time the singularity in expression ( [ ctrw_conf_ea_auto ] ) causes a dip toward the stationary plateau . additionally , we find that the exact form of the confining potential solely enters into the prefactor through the first two moments of the boltzmann distribution . <n> brownian particles confined in potential wells or in boxes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , and biology @xcite . in particular , the motion of a charged particle in a potential well is of great interest , since it can be used to test the validity of theories of statistical mechanics , as well as for the design of new experimental setups . as such ,<n> confinement - induced brownian motion has been studied theoretically and experimentally for decades , see e.g. refs . and references therein . however , until we study the subdiffusive motion of a test particle in a harmonic binding potential under the action of an external field .<n> the particle is initially prepared in an unbiased configuration , i.e. , in the center of the binding potential well , and then confined to a box . for harmonic confinement , we find that subdiffusion is characterized by a scale - free distribution of waiting times , whereas for box confinement the distribution is power - law in the lag time @xmath0 , with an exponent that depends on the external field strength . by means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis ,<n> we show that the confinement - induced scaling is universal , independent of the type of confinement . <n> the motion of test particles is one of the most fundamental problems in physics . in experiments<n> , it is used to determine the properties of chemical reactions @xcite , to probe the limits of chemical equilibration and the validity of the standard model of particle physics , as well as to prepare a new state of matter in a controlled environment , such as a liquid crystal , or a solid state system . the unbiased motion of the test particle<n> is determined by the measurement time , which we study the motion of a particle under the action of a harmonic potential and confined to a finite interval .<n> we introduce a cutoff in the waiting - time distribution , terminating the power - law scaling of the time average of the particle around its ensemble mean . by varying this cutoff time<n> we show that the process exhibits the features of continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) subdiffusion , i.e. , the turnover from the initial scaling @xmath0 to the confinement - dominated scaling . for a suitable choice of the cutoff time the time averaged mean squared displacement under confinement preserves the characteristic non - ergodic features of ctrl . <n> motion under the influence of an external harmonic potential is often described by brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite . under certain conditions<n> the motion is ergodic , that is , it converges to a stationary value @x<n> . however , in many situations motion is not ergodic and it is not clear how to generalize the ergodicity of fbm to the case in which the potential is harmonic . in this work<n> we study motion under harmonic confinement , a process that is known to exhibit a rich variety of non we demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the position of a particle in a harmonic trap can be used to distinguish different stochastic processes .<n> the method is based on the time series of the particle s position @xmath0 as recorded in a confined one - dimensional position - position model ( fbm ) , under the influence of an harmonic potential . in the limit of long measurement time<n> the time averaged mean squared displacement converges to a stationary value . for short measurement times ,<n> deviations from the stationary value are quantified in terms of the probability density function of the dimensionless ratio of the time - averaged mean - squared displacement over its ensemble mean . <n> _ introduction _ stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics and biology , and play an important role in many areas of science @xcite . despite their ubiquity , however , it is not yet clear how to use them to identify the underlying stochastic process . to this end<n> , different methods have been proposed , e.g. , the use of time series analysis ( tsa ) @x<n> . a further development would be to use stochastic time series as a tool to characterize the underlying dynamics , for example in the context of we study subdiffusion in a system of @xmath0-dimensional harmonically confined oscillators , where the motion is confined to a finite interval and is subject to the action of an external driving force .<n> the driving force is assumed to break the ergodicity of the motion , and we show that this leads to the appearance of a characteristic time dependence of the mean squared displacement , which we characterize by the violation of the ergodic law . for the latter , we find that the time average of the squared displacement decays exponentially with the largest possible lag time , in agreement with the prediction of a one - sided lvy stable distribution . <n> motion under the influence of an externally imposed force is a ubiquitous phenomenon in physics , chemistry and biology . in biology<n> it is used to model the motion of cells and bacteria , while in physics it is crucial to understand the role of confinement in the formation and evolution of proteins and nuclei @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the study of motion under confinement has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of kelvin , rumple and rosen more than half a century ago . over the last decades , considerable progress has we show that continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) with a cutoff in the characteristic time scale violate ergodicity .<n> we demonstrate that this is a universal feature of subdiffusion with cutoff , which persists even in the presence of extreme events , provided that the breaking of the ergodic condition is accompanied by a change in the shape of the distribution of the time lag . <n> _ introduction _ violation of ergodic invariance is one of the most fundamental problems in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite and has been extensively studied in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally . in this context<n> , it has been shown to occur in a variety of physical systems , ranging from microscopic models of self - assembly to the dynamics of nuclear reaction kinetics , as well as in a wide variety of experimental situations , from single molecules to ensembles of micro- and nano - aggregates . on the theoretical side ,<n> a number of approaches have been proposed to account for the violation of the symmetries of the system , such as : stochastic processes in which the system is driven out of equilibrium , _<n> e.g. _ , @xmath0 stochastic we study subdiffusion of two - dimensional harmonic oscillators in the presence of long - ranged spatial correlations .<n> we show that for sufficiently small lag times @xmath0 , the motion is subdiffusive , and the process is ergodic . for small deviations from ergodicity ,<n> the time averaged mean squared displacement approaches a gaussian limiting distribution , that is centred around the value of the process s ergodic parameter . in the long measurement time limit the distribution converges to a sharp form , which is , however , surprisingly well preserved for short trajectories . <n> the motion of a harmonic oscillator under the action of an external force is a long - standing problem in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite . over the years<n> a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of different types of motion , such as unconfined , confined , damped and damped harmonic oscillator motion . at the same time , a great amount of attention has been given to the problem of motion under the influence of confinement , since this is the only way to overcome the confinement effect . on the other hand , for motion in a harmonic potential  we study confined quasi - random walks on the square lattice , which are described by two different subdiffusion models : continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .<n> we show that subdiffusive ergodicity breaking is present in both models , but that it is associated with a lag time @xmath0 , similar to the lag time of diffusion . in the long measurement time limit<n> , we find that the convergence to the ergodic solution is algebraically slow , and the time averaged mean squared displacement decays algebraically with the time scale . <n> confined quasi random walks are a paradigmatic model of nonlinear dynamics , used to describe a wide range of phenomena in physics , chemistry , biology and material science @xcite . on the other hand ,<n> they are also of interest as models for dynamical processes in confined environments , for which experimental data are scarce . here , <n> we study two models of confined quasirandom walks , one of which is based on a stochastic description , the other on a markovian description . for both models<n> we analyse the time evolution of the system , starting from different we show that the velocity autocorrelation function is a useful tool to distinguish between continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) in lattice subdiffusion .<n> we use this tool to compare the properties of subdiffusive and confined ctws . in particular , we demonstrate that for confined subd iffusion fbm is characterized by the absence of correlations for different jump lengths , whereas for unbounded ctw the shape of the velocity correlation function does not allow for a significant distinction between subdiffusive and confined processes . <n> subdiffusiophores are diffusion - like processes in which the diffusion constant is different from the mean value of the underlying dynamics @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the dynamics of these systems is highly non - markovian , and it is not clear how to define a proper model of diffusion in these systems . a recently introduced model of  confined '' time - dependent random walks , or ctwds for short , is a paradigmatic example of such a sub - diffusive model . here<n> we study the properties and the nature of this model for lattices of different sizes . using numerical simulations<n> we we show that the velocity autocorrelation function is a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish between two distinct subdiffusive processes : continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .<n> we demonstrate that the shape of this function may not be a good diagnosis tool as it acquires negative values and decays as a power - law for long times , as the motion is confined . for free subdiffusion , on the other hand , we observe that this function decays to zero as the long time limit is approached . <n> _ introduction. _ the problem of identifying the underlying physical mechanism behind fractional brownians motion ( fbp ) is one of the most important in the theory of brownian dynamics @xcite . in order to understand the underlying mechanism ,<n> it is of interest to perform numerical simulations of fbp and compare the results with analytical predictions . to this end<n> , it is important to identify the mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the fractional brown dwarf ( fbd ) statistics , which is a well - known and well - studied example of fractionally correlated diffusive motion . from a theoretical point of view<n> the fbd problem subdiffusive random walk ( ctrw ) and single file diffusion ( fbm ) have been observed in a wide range of complex systems .<n> the physical mechanisms leading to subdiffusion in biological cells or other complex systems are varied . here , we show that the velocity autocorrelation function may not be a good diagnosis tool to distinguish between these processes . from our analysis<n> it becomes clear that the shape of the velocity correlation function may be not a good diagnostic tool to differentiate between subd iffusion and free random walk . <n> random walk is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in nature<n> , random walks are often associated with anomalous diffusion , but the physical mechanism leading to such effects is not well understood . for example , anomalous diffusion of inert biopolymers larger than some 10kd in living cells is due to molecular crowding , these are excluded volume effects in the viscoelastic , superdense cellular environment . on the other hand , the random motion of brownian tracer particles diffusing in a one dimensional channel and interacting with other brownian particles will slow down their random motion , and anomalous diffusion with @xmath0 subdiffusion and fractional brownian motion are the two most common anomalous stochastic processes observed in single particle tracking of biomolecules and passive tracers in cells and other complex media . here<n> we collected the behaviour of the anomalous mean squared displacements @xmath0 for these two processes . for ctrw subd iffusion , connected with ageing and weak ergodicity breaking , in an unconfined cell , we found the fractional diffusion exponents to be : (dt)c)times  rangle$ ] , where c epsilon  2 $ ] is the time averaged mean displacement , and dt <n> beta  0.2 $ ) is the exponent for the anomalous time dependence of the mean square displacement .<n> for the continuous time random walk process , tt=cgamma gammaright. ]<n> ] the exponents are  ( ttb ) times+beta0.2$] . <n> we also found that the time dependences of the fractional exponents depend on the we study the behaviour of the time averaged mean squared displacement @xmath0 for two prominent anomalous stochastic processes , the continuous time random walk and fractional brownian motion . for ctrw subdiffusion , connected with ageing and weak ergodicity breaking , in an unconfined system the time<n> averaged mean square displacement scales linearly in time .<n> only the dependence on the overall measurement time pays tribute to the underlying subd iffusion . under confinement<n> no plateau value is observed as in the ensemble average , instead , a power - law of the form , eq . ( [ conf_tamsd ] ) , is found . interestingly , this characteristic behaviour is approximately preserved when an appropriate cutoff in the waiting time is introduced . conversely the distribution of the times averaged mean<n> squared displacement around its ensemble mean becomes almost gaussian in presence of the cutoff , while it has an exponential decay and a finite value at a cutoff time when the system is non - ergodic and exhibits ageing . at the same time the velocity autocorrelation is hardly distinguishable from that of fbm . <n> _ in situ _ is a standard tool in biophysical  subdiffusion is a fundamental stochastic process that is observed in a wide range of physical , chemical , and biological systems .<n> recently , it has been shown that confined thermal diffusion - limited reactions ( ctrws ) can be used as a model system to study anomalous diffusion behaviour , in particular , under confinement . in this letter , we present an analysis of the velocity autocorrelation and the ensemble average of the mean squared displacement of confined confined thermal subd iffusion ( fbm ) . using the theory of fox @xmath0-functions we are able to obtain the exact asymptotic form for the distribution of the dimensionless time averaged variable . for finite time<n> series we find that the two processes share the same asymptotic form , despite sharing the same form of the ensemble averaged mean squared displaced . at the same time the velocity correlation of confined trw subdaffusion is hardly distinguishable from that of fbm subdifffusion . given a recorded time series of anomalous diffusion from experiment it is important to know more precisely which stochastic process is responsible for the observed behaviour . <n> subdiffusive motion is ubiquitous in biological processes , such as gene transcription @xcite , we study a simple model of a self - avoiding walk .<n> the walk is assumed to follow a random walk of length @xmath0 , with a random number of steps given by a power - law distribution of the steps . in the limit of large steps ,<n> the model reduces to the well - known gaussian random walk model , which has been extensively studied in the literature . here<n> , we generalize the model by introducing an additional degree of freedom , namely , the ability to change the sign of the random walk at each step . by varying this additional parameter<n> we find that the walk can be made to follow the same power law distribution as the original random walk , but with different exponents . <n> _ introduction _ the study of random walks is one of the most fundamental problems in statistical mechanics @xcite . on the one hand<n> this problem is relevant to many areas of science and engineering , such as random matrix theory ( rmt ) , non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , quantum information theory , as well as random walks on lattices , surfaces , and random networks . at the same time , it is important to understand the behavior we study the dynamics of the kolmogorov particle in a one - dimensional harmonic trap with a sinusoidally modulated potential .<n> the sinusoidal potential is assumed to be the sum of a gaussian white noise and a fractional brownian motion . using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques ,<n> we show that the noise can be decomposed into a sum of two terms : the first one corresponds to the sinusoid modulation of the potential and the second one is the long - range part of the noise . in the long run<n> , this may lead to the emergence of a periodic orbit in the phase space of the system . <n> pacs numbers : 05.30.-d , 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r , 47.54.+r in recent years , the study of noise in many - body systems has become an active area of research , with applications ranging from quantum information processing @xcite , to atomic and molecular physics , and to condensed matter physics . at the heart of this activity<n> is the question of how noise affects the properties of a system , in particular , how it affects the correlations between the system and the environment . we consider the harris -

range coupling ( the folding prize ) naturally arises in our model due to the long range interaction ( the unfolding profile ) . despite its extreme simplicity , our approach captures some important aspects of the physics of ig domain stretching . *<n> pacs * : 87.14.gg , 87.10.+e , 87.15.aa , 05.40.+j , 82.70.-y the domain structure of a protein is encoded in its sequence of amino acids , which are arranged in a lattice known as an ig module @xcite . in a specific protein ,<n> the i27- and i+@xmath1-strands ( i , ii and ii being the first two letters of the alphabet , respectively ) of the i g immunoglobulin ( we propose a simple model for the folding of a multi -

like structures , and by rescaling the conformational force we propose a simple model to describe the helix - coil transition in a single domain of a single polypeptide chain .<n> the model consists of an energy function with two terms : one accounts for the elasticity of the system , while the other stabilizes the system when the fraction of intact contacts crosses a pre - chosen threshold . <n> the energy function is thus equivalent to a force rescaling occurring whenever the polymer enters the native basin , and the contact term of the energy term appears to be a square well . in the limit of a very high pulling rate ,<n> the unfolding force can be approximated by the sum of a harmonic contribution and a stabilizing contact term , the latter corresponding to the crossing of a threshold ; in the opposite limit , in which the pulling rate decreases exponentially with the distance from the threshold , a simple analytic treatment of the unfolding probability appears to provide an excellent description of the simulation results . the coil - helix transition @xcite is one of the most important phenomena in the field of polymer physics , occurring in the simplest arrangement of the afm ( atomic force microscope ) . here<n> , we present an approach to the description of this transition , based on the application of a we investigate the dynamics of folding of a single domain of a macromolecular protein under the action of an external force .<n> we show that the folding process can be described as a sequence of successive unfolding events , each of which is strongly influenced by the reciprocal influence of neighboring unfolding events that can occur at different pulling rates . in the limit of very high pulling rates<n> , we derive an analytical expression for the unfolding probability in terms of the pulling rate . <n> folding is one of the most important processes in molecular biology , occurring in the cytoplasm and in the interior of cells as well as in living organisms @xcite . during folding ,<n> the energy of a protein is converted into the kinetic energy of the polymer molecules involved in the unfolding process , thus leading to a folding process known as unfolding of the protein , i.e. , the sequence of consecutive folding events of a molecule in contact with its surroundings . while the energy involved in each unfolding event is proportional to the number of monomers involved in that event ( @xmath0 ) , a significant fraction of the energy is thus dissipated in the form of energy fluctuations , related to the long - range interactions among the monomers , where @x we present a theoretical study of the folding and stretching properties of a single polymer consisting of two mutually interacting springs .<n> we show that the average length of the protein - spring increases linearly with the stretching rate , provided that the monomer - monomer interactions are short - ranged , so that the polymer is not stretched too strongly . in the limit of large stretching rates , however , the average polymer length diverges , signaling the folding of the polymer . <n> the properties of proteins are of central importance to the functioning of living cells @xcite . for example , proteins such as dna and rna are the fundamental building blocks of cells , yet they are very fragile when subjected to external forces , such as a heat - bath or a pulling force . as a result ,<n> understanding the mechanical response of proteins is an important issue , which has received considerable attention in the last few years ( for a recent review , see , for instance , http://link.aps.org/doi/abs/10.1103/physrevlett.110.245401[110 ] ) . a major step towards a unified description of proteins<n> is the concept of a folding - folding we study the mechanism of mechanical unfolding of a single - domain protein from a folded to an unfolded state .<n> the folding prize associated to the sawtooth shape of the protein , related to the enthalpic component of the free energy , plays an important role in the mechanism , as it stabilizes the compact conformation . on the other hand ,<n> the long - range interaction due to the cantilever relaxes the harmonic energy and leads to an entropic force that favors unfolding . in order to describe this mechanism<n> , we analyze the entropic effects related to temperature , the role of the long range interaction , and the relation between pulling rate and unfolding force , finding a logarithmic law valid in the limit of high pulling rate . <n> protein folding is one of the most important molecular processes , involved in the formation and maintenance of a wide variety of structures in living cells @xcite . during the folding process , proteins interact with their surrounding environment , either through conformational changes ( conformational transitions ) or conformational rearrangements ( unfolding ) , which can be induced by chemical , thermal , or other means @xmath0 . the mechanism by which these interactions take place is still not we present a theoretical study of the mechanism of protein folding and unfolding based on a coarse - grained free energy density functional theory .<n> the folding of a single domain of a protein is described by a folding prize that is determined by the number of contacts , _<n> i.e. _ , the number @xmath0 of compact conformations allowed in a moment preceding the unfolding event . as a consequence ,<n> the free energy is characterized by two quantities : the folding prize , which is the sum of the elastic free energy and the harmonic energy of the cantilever spring ; and the entropic free energy , characterizing the entropy of the unraveling of the compact conformation . by contrast , if the harmonic constant of the spring is not large , then the enthalpic free energy dominates and the unfolding of the protein proceeds by breaking only a small fraction of the contacts . <n> protein folding is one of the most important events in the life of a living cell @xcite . in this process<n> the dna plays a crucial role , not only as a binding site of rna and/or rna polymerases , but also as a dna binding site in the cell s nucleus @ we study the role of entropic degrees of freedom in the computation of free energies in two - dimensional lattice models .<n> we show that the free energy computation is strongly influenced by the temperature , and in particular , by the entropic contribution to the enthalpic spring term . by contrast , when the inverse temperature @xmath0 is not large enough , the unfolding event is entropically favoured . <n> pacs numbers : 87.10.+e , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 68.35.rh 2 lattice models are an important tool in the study of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the role played by the different contributions to free energy that are possible in these models , as well as the interplay between these different contributions . to this end ,<n> the problem of computing free energies of lattice models has been the subject of numerous studies . at present , most of the attention is focused on the euclidean version of the model , which has been shown to give very good results in the thermodynamic limit . however , in spite of its simplicity , lattice models exhibit a we study the dynamics of a simple model of self - assembly consisting of a spring interacting with an external field , in the limit of zero temperature .<n> we show that the transition from the folded to the unfolded state is strongly influenced by the mutual influence of the unfolding events resulting from the action of the spring . as a consequence ,<n> the free energy landscape near the transition is strongly modified . <n> the folding transition of an isolated , self - assembled system is one of the most important transitions in living cells @xcite . in spite of the simplicity of the model , which consists of a collection of interacting springs , the transition can be very different depending on the temperature @xmath0 and on the number of degrees of freedom of the system : for low temperatures the system is in a stretched state , for high temperatures it is in an unfolded state and vice versa . on the other hand , as the temperature is increased , or as the strength of the external field is decreased , there is a competition between the two transitions : in the low temperature limit the unfolding transition is suppressed and the transition to the folded state is rapid , while in the high temperature limit , it is rapid and continuous @x we show that the unfolding transition of a domain of a polymer chain , induced by an elastic force , can be described in terms of a first - order phase transition between a folded and a stretched state .<n> we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a model polymer chain with @xmath0 contacts and demonstrate that the free energy of the folded state is lower than that of the unfolded state , thus forbidding the breakdown of the collapsed domain . as a consequence ,<n> the stretching transition occurs at a higher value of the elastic force than predicted by mean - field theory . <n> the study of phase transitions is one of the most fundamental problems in statistical mechanics . in the last years<n> , a great effort has been devoted to the analysis of the phase diagram of a large class of systems , ranging from soft matter @xcite and biological polymers @xxcite to complex networks of interacting particles @x<n> . a large part of this work has focused on the properties of the transition between different states , but also on the role of the underlying phase transition itself @ xcite . among the different phase transitions that have been investigated in this context , stretching transitions are of particular interest because they are induced by the action of the we show that the unfolding transition of a single domain of a polymer in the presence of a constant pulling force is governed by the fluctuations of the polymer and of the spring length .<n> this result is obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulations of a spherical polymer in which the pulling force induces the unfolding of two domains of different conformations . when the first domain collapses , the folding prize is given to the polymer that exhibits the largest number of accessible conformations during the pulling transition . as a result ,<n> the polymer with the largest folding number is the one that emerges after the first unraveling event . <n> the transition from a polymer with a bounded conformation space to a conformation space that is accessible to the system due to a constant force is one of the most important transitions that can occur in a living cell @xcite . in order to understand the mechanism of this transition , it is necessary to investigate the properties of the system during the unfolding process , in particular to determine the number of conformations that are accessible during the transition and to characterize the fluctuations that take place during the process . for polymers in solution , this question is particularly relevant because the energy required to unfold a domain of size @xmath0 is of the order of @ we study the role of fluctuations on the unfolding of proteins by means of coarse - grained simulations .<n> we show that the number of cleaved contacts in a protein increases before each collapse event , thus determining an increase of the fluctuations and favouring the breakdown of another domain . as a consequence ,<n> the height of the second peak of the @xmath0-peaks of the unfolding plot is less pronounced than the first one . at low temperatures , however , the fluctuations rapidly become negligible and the heights of the peaks become roughly the same due to the identical energetic features of the domains . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of protein folding @xcite , folding dynamics has been the subject of intense research efforts . in this context<n> , it has been shown that the energy landscape of proteins can be divided into two main categories : ( i ) the entropic energy landscape , which describes the energy balance between the different domains of the protein , and ( ii ) a harmonic energy landscape that describes the harmonic energy balance among domains , i.e. a  folding prize '' . for a large class of proteins , such as those involved in protein folding , we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the force - extension profiles of proteins composed of identical domains .<n> we show that thermal fluctuations are able to overcome energy barriers and the protein is pulled at a finite velocity , which leads to a non - equilibrium stretching process . upon unfolding , the protein domains , upon stretching the polymer , are coupled due to the identical energetic features of the domains and the height of the peaks of the @xmath0 plot only depends on the energetic term . as a consequence , at low temperatures , thermal fluctuations<n> are allowed enough time to overcome the energy barrier and the pulling force will be low . <n> proteins are composed by a large number of domains that interact with each other through the exchange of energy . in order to understand the function of proteins at the cellular scale ,<n> it is essential to study the dynamics of protein - protein interactions , _<n> i.e. _ when a protein is _ pulled _ at a constant velocity by another protein at a different temperature . to this purpose , in this work , we consider a simple model , namely a simple protein composed by identical domains ( _ e.g. : _ dna  we study the effect of an external force on the energy landscape of a two - state model by means of monte - carlo simulations .<n> we consider a model with a single energy barrier along the reaction path , where thermal fluctuations are allowed enough time to overcome the energy barrier and the unfolding force is low . by increasing the number of steps @xmath0 in the model , we find that the equilibrium unfolding scenario is recovered , as long as the pulling speed is proportional to the absolute temperature . <n> pacs numbers : : 87.10.+e , 05.40.+j , 82.70.-y , 87.16.dg , 87.15.a- the study of thermal fluctuations is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics . in thermodynamics<n> , they can be described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , which states that , for a thermodynamic system , the distribution of the energy dissipated in the process of heat exchange between two spatially separated parts of the system does not depend on the temperature difference between the two parts , but only on the difference between their equilibrium temperatures . on the other hand , in the field of soft matter , thermal fluctuations can we show that monte - carlo simulations of the thermal motion of a granular material , under pulling , can be used to simulate the equilibrium phase of a two - dimensional granular system .<n> we find that , as the number of monte carlo steps @xmath0 is increased , the system undergoes a transition from an equilibrium phase , in which fluctuations are at their equilibrium level , to a phase in which they are much larger , leading to a much faster unfolding of the granular structure . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) granular materials , such as granular materials of different shapes and materials with different mechanical properties , are ubiquitous in nature and technology . in particular , they are found in a wide range of applications , ranging from medicine to industry and from the environment to the earth s crust @xcite . a common feature of these materials is their mechanical response , _<n> i.e. _ their propensity to rupture under the action of gravity , resulting in the rearrangement of the surrounding material and the loss of functionality of the system , and thus , from a number of important societal and environmental implications . we study the mechanical and dynamical properties of protein folding and unfolding .<n> we show that the folding prize , the longest extension of the protein domain , is the key to the success of the unfolding process ; loss of the prize results in the disintegration of the entire protein domain and the subsequent relaxation of the spring . using a combination of analytical theory and monte - carlo simulations ,<n> we compute the threshold and the spontaneous unfolding rate as a function of the pulling speed , and show that these quantities can be obtained easily from experiments and simulations . <n> the folding of protein domains is a fundamental process in biology , playing a key role in the development of proteins , their functions and their internal states @xcite . in order to understand the folding mechanism , it is necessary to take into account the properties of the free energy landscape surrounding the protein ; in particular , a polymer typically has a free energy barrier that acts as an activation barrier separating different conformations of the polymer . as a result<n> , protein domains can be cleaved in a dynamic process known as unfolding , in which the extension of a protein domain is controlled by the loss of its folding prize @xmath0 , where the folding - we study the mechanical unfolding of a domain of a macromolecular spring .<n> we show that the folding prize , which determines the extension of the domain , is destroyed when a number of contacts just below the pulling threshold are cleaved in the polymer . on the other hand ,<n> the length of the folded domain is preserved if more contacts are disrupted . by computing the energy difference between the two states , we identify the factors affecting the unfolding probability . in particular , the stiffness of the cantilever , temperature and the pulling velocity are found to be the key factors . <n> the folding of protein domains is an example of a process in which a large number of steps play a crucial role @xcite . at low temperatures , such as in the vicinity of the protein folding threshold , a protein domain can be unfolded by mechanical forces , e.g. , through the action of an external force @xmath0 , provided the external force exceeds a certain threshold . for proteins of a large class , including those that are known to fold spontaneously , this process is a non - trivial one : a folding prize is lost , followed by a subsequent relaxation of the spring , leading to a mechanical unfolding of proteins and nucleic acids is an important process involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes .<n> we develop an analytic model of polymer stretching in which the folding prize is attributed to domains where the fraction of folded monomers is above a pre - chosen threshold . our model is consistent with recent findings showing that the unraveling of the titin immunoglobulin domain occurs very rapidly only after the breakdown of a critical number of key hydrogen - bonds . in particular , we show that the force of unfolding tends to increase with each unfolding event , suggesting that the unfolding probability may depend on the temperature and the pulling velocity . using monte carlo simulations ,<n> we demonstrate that our model can reproduce many qualitative features of the force - extension profiles recorded in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiments , in particular the typical saw - tooth pattern with peaks characterized by a height dependent on thefolding prize , the temperature , and the pulls constant . <n> [ [ section ] ] in recent years , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of the dynamics of mechanical unfolding in biological systems @xcite . mechanical unfolding is an essential process occurring in the evolution of a large variety of cellular structures we study the role of thermal fluctuations in the stretching of engineered modular constructs of real proteins using a topological and united - residue model . in particular , we show that an increase in thermal fluctuations results in a lowering of the force peaks and in their earlier occurrence during stretching .<n> our results appear to be in agreement with recent findings by cieplak @xcite in steered molecular dynamics simulations of titin and calmodulin unfolding using a go - like model , where thermal fluctuations were found to play an important role . an interesting feature of afm stretching experiments is that the mean unfolding force is a logarithmic function of the pulling rate . mechanical unfolding is a fundamental process that plays an important role in the formation of complex biomolecules . in recent years<n> , significant progress has been made in the understanding of this process , particularly in the context of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques .<n> however , the existing stretching models do not take into account the important role played by thermal fluctuations in the unfolding process . here , we present a minimal stretching model that takes into account thermal fluctuations and reproduces the main features of the force - extension saw - tooth pattern observed in afm stretching experiments , as well as the correct logarithmic dependence of the mean unfolding force on the logarithm of the pulling rate reported in experimental works . finally , our model provides a simple explanation of the influence of each unfolding event on the following ones , based on the role of fluctuations . <n> the mechanism of molecular unfolding is one of the most fundamental processes that can be studied in the natural and artificial sciences . during the course of unfolding , proteins undergo a series of conformational changes , called unfolding events , that lead to the production of a variety of different biopolymers , such as dna , rna , we use coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the transition state ensemble ( tse ) and  en - route '' intermediates for protein folding .<n> we find that topological factors play an important role in determining the detailed structure of the transition states and the intermediates , and that the energetic balance between binding energy and entropy plays a crucial role in the formation of these features . <n> [ [ section ] ] the mechanism of protein folding is one of the most important aspects of biopolymerization . in order to understand the folding mechanism of proteins ,<n> it is important to understand how the topology of the protein building blocks affects its ability to fold . to this end<n> , topological factors have been studied extensively in the context of protein structure @xcite . however , it is not clear what topological factors are responsible for the specific features of the folding process and how they can be used to improve our understanding of this important process . here , we focus on the topological factors that control the ability of proteins to fold into globular clusters , which are the most abundant form of life on the earth . despite their importance , very little<n> is known about the mechanisms by which topological factors affect the folding",

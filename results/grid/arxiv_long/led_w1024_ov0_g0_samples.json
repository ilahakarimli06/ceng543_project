conjugation and chiral transformations .     in particular , we used the chiral transformation to show that , for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , the @xmath5 and @xmath11 solutions have the same spectrum .     these conclusions are quite general and do not depend on the number of dimensions so that they remain true in 3 + 1 dimensions .     also , most of the features of the 1 + 1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3 + 1 relativistic harmonic oscillator . indeed , since the 1 + 1 eigenvalue equations for @xmath9 and @xmath6 are very similar to the corresponding 3 + 1 equations , we can apply the same graphical methods to the 3 + 1 case , and therefore most of the analysis of the 1 + 1 case remains true with appropriate changes .     for instance , the shape of the parabola in the energy-@xmath26 plane related to @xmath413 would depend now on the value of the spin -

additive to @xmath107 , or vice versa \u001c . this projection drastically changes the algebraic nature of the operation . in fact \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , it breaks the commutativity : @xmath109 , and the associativity : @xmath110 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , it breaks the commutativity : @xmath111 , and the associativity : @xmath110 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ so , the ordering of the operations matters in this case . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ it should be mentioned here that we can create some different definitions of the addition simply by different projections of @xmath111 onto @xmath44 . as a starting point \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , we stick to the above definition and will mention another possibility later . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note also that , precisely speaking , @xmath103 is either a candidate for a fluctuation or a fluctuation which sometimes does nothing , because of the projection . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ it should be mentioned here that if the configuration at the time @xmath95 is given by @xmath112 , the configuration @xmath113 can be expressed by a series of successive additions of @xmath103 to @xmath112 : g(t_0+t ) = g(t_0 ) . 128 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ below is the basic information of @xmath121 : dim v(_ h_n ) & = & 2n , dim v(_ h_n ) & = & 2n , dim v(_ h_n ) & = & 2n , dim v_b ( _ h_n ) & = & 4n , dim e(_h_n ) & = & 3n^2 + 52 n - 92 , f & = & n^2 - , for odd @xmath129 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ @xmath130 is the set of all the boundary sites of degree two . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the number of faces is denoted by @xmath131 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we first plot the probability @xmath132 of the no - loop configuration , or of the total frustration , for different sizes in fig.([fig : pf - log ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we have observed that it decays approximately exponentially with respect to the area of the lattice . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the @xmath77-axis stands for the area of the lattice counted by the number of hexagonal faces in @xmath0 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ there can be obviously seen a scalability . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the error bars are given at the 95% confidence level ratio of the moving particles among all , while @xmath146 is of the trapped particles .    the nearly constant value of @xmath145 might suggest that the value is intrinsically universal for all honeycomb lattices .     the average loop number @xmath141 is not so stabilised compared to the average loop length @xmath91 .     it should be remarked here that the projection in our addition ( [ def : addition ] ) would certainly change the probability of the fluctuations , but only its characteristic time scale .     if so , we claim that the above values and qualitative arguments are characteristic in this type of models , regardless of the addition rule defined earlier .     it is the dynamical aspect of the model that the addition rule makes different . in this stochastic flow model , the particles 々 are basically trapped in the sites alike in the stochastic markovian model .    the particles 々 are trapped in the streamlines , but , once they are involved in the streamlines , they keep moving until it is stopped by a fluctuation .    the particles 々 are basically trapped in the sites alike in the stochastic markovian of the lattice liquid . in order to illustrate this , � we have calculated the asymptotic value of the msd with some assumption as follows . � we have calculated the asymptotic value of the msd with some assumption as follows . � we have calculated the time correlation of every particle on @xmath0 with some assumption as follows . � we have calculated the time correlation of every particle on @xmath0 vanishes so that a particle situated at any of the sites on @xmath0 at a certain time @xmath95 is to be drifted to every site with equal footing in the infinite future . � then , the asymptotic value of @xmath160 can simply be given by the average of the square distances of all the relevant pairs of the sites on @xmath0 . � on the rectangular honeycomb lattice @xmath121 , we derived its exact formula and the leading terms are given by : [ eq : asymptotic_approx ] _ � t+ = 18 ( 7 n^2 + 10 n ) + o(1 ) . in the case of @xmath161 , � the exact values are up to first five digits : [ eq this reduction of the fluctuations is entirely due to the definition of the projected addition . because of the second line of the projection rule ( [ def : addition ] ) \u001c , if @xmath164 is huge enough as a set , many elements of @xmath44 become non - additive . � even so , practically speaking in quasi - critical states , there are about 30% vacant faces . � therefore , the system can not be entirely frozen , changing only the time scale for its dynamics . � it is the msd on which the time scale matters . especially , the emergence of the plateaus in fig.[fig : msd11 -

intersecting loop is nothing but a self - avoiding walk ending at its start @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we illustrate the structure of the spaces in terms of the cycle space in graph theory . we restrict ourselves to the planar cases unless otherwise stated . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we illustrate the structure of the spaces in terms of the cycle space in graph theory . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we illustrate the structure of the spaces in terms of the cycle space in graph theory . we restrict ourselves to the planar cases unless otherwise stated . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ when @xmath0 is planar , _ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ i.e. _ , @xmath0 can be embedded on a plane with no bonds crossing , the space @xmath45 can be embedded on a plane with no bonds crossing , the space @xmath45 can be spanned by the set of the smallest loops which are the perimeters of the interior faces of @xmath0 . in graph theory , there is the so - called cycle space @xmath184 which is generated by all the simple cycles and whose basis = 1- p_l ( ) = 1 , 0 & & p_l(g ) 1 , 0 & & p_l(g ) 1 , 0p_f(g ) 1 , 0p_f(g ) 1 . in the third line , for finite @xmath76 and @xmath0 ,    we assume that the equalities @xmath202 and @xmath203 only hold when @xmath76 or @xmath0 is linear or the assignment of the `` potential '' probabilities of the particles moving are unnaturally given in the non - stochastic limit .     in the fourth line , for finite @xmath76 and @xmath0 ,    we assume that the equalities @xmath76 and @xmath0 are linear or the assignment of the `` potential '' probabilities of the particles moving are unnaturally given in the non -

      "generated": "most massive stars begin their lives in the darkest recesses of giant molecular clouds , obscured from our view by a thick veil of dust and gas .    the problem is further compounded by the fact that most of the time the earliest stages of massive star formation can not be observed at visual wavelengths , and in many cases even the near - infrared emission from these protostars can not escape .     we owe much of our ignorance of the massive star formation process to the fact that we have a very limited range of wavelengths at our disposal with which to observe these youngest stages of massive stellar evolution .     the problem is further compounded by the fact that massive stars ( @xmath1 8 m@xmath2 ) are relatively few in number and , like all stages of massive stellar evolution , the formation process proceeds very quickly .     the problem is further compounded by the fact that there is a very limited range of wavelengths at our disposal with which to observe these youngest stages of massive star formation .     the problem is further compounded by the fact that massive stars ( @xmath1 8 m@xmath2 ) are relatively few in number and , like all stages of massive stellar evolution , the formation process proceeds very quickly . , degree of flattening ) , in principle , these kinds of observations would allow testing of more sophisticated models , with a degree of detail similar to that of those that have been developed for low - mass protostars ( e.g. , osorio et al . \u001c 2003 ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ recently , observations by de buizer ( 2004 ) and de buizer et al . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( 2003 ) have identified four candidate hmpos that have been observed in the mid - infrared with high - angular resolution . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ these hmpo candidates lie in areas of high mass star formation , as evidenced by nearby uc regions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ in fact in two of these four cases , high spatial resolution observations from 8 m telescopes were needed to simply isolate the mid - infrared emission of the hmpos from the nearby uc regions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this means that , though more sensitive than what is achievable from the ground , data from infrared satellites like _ msx _          these hmpo candidates lie in areas of high mass star formation , as evidenced by nearby uc regions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ in fact in two of these four cases , high spatial resolution observations from 8 m telescopes were needed to simply isolate the mid - infrared emission of the hmpos � flux densities were derived for each filter for the hmpo candidate as well as any other mid - infrared sources on the field . � tables 2 - 4 list the flux densities for all sources . � these flux densities are quoted with their 1-@xmath11 total error , which is a quadrature addition of the statistical variation from the aperture photometry ( due to the standard deviation of the background array noise ) and the flux calibration error . � usually the flux calibration error is found from the variation of the standard star flux throughout the course of the night , however our observations were taken piece - wise on many nights throughout several semesters . � these flux densities are quoted with their 1-@xmath11 total error , which is a quadrature addition of the statistical variation from the aperture photometry ( due to the standard deviation of the background array noise ) and the flux calibration error . � usually the flux calibration error is found from the variation of the standard star flux throughout the course of the night , however our observations were taken piece - wise on many nights throughout several semesters . � flux calibration was therefore achieved by observing a standard star at a similar airmass just before or after the observation of the drt03 1 was imaged at 2.7 mm by watt & mundy ( 1999 ) , but there was no detection at the site of drt03 1 . mpo .     this technique was employed for the images obtained in the work presented here . in table 3    this technique was employed for the images obtained in the work presented here . in table 3    this technique was employed for the images obtained in the work presented here . in table 3    this technique was employed for the images obtained in the work presented here . in table 3    this technique was employed for the images obtained in the work presented here . in table 3    the g29.96 - 0.02 hmpo has been studied in great detail in molecular line studies ( e.g. , cesaroni et al . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1998 , wyrowski , schilke , & walmsley 1999 ; maxia et al . 2001 . ) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ however , other than the mid - infrared observations of de buizer et al . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( 2002 ) and those presented here , only a few continuum observations at other wavelengths exist .    the g29.96 - 0.02 hmpo has been studied in great detail in molecular line studies ( e.g. , cesaroni et al . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1998 , wyrowski , sch placing it in a stage of formation before the onset of an outflow .     while the resolution of the 800 and 450 @xmath0 m maps of hunter , phillips , & menten ( 1997 ) are too coarse to ascertain which mid - infrared source may be dominating the emission at these longer wavelengths , their higher resolution ( @xmath32@xmath5 ) 3 mm map shows no emission from the location of drt03 3 , though emission is detected towards the other two mid - infrared sources on the field .    our new observations of this field with gemini have revealed the presence of four more faint mid - infrared sources present ( figure 3 ) in addition to those already found by de buizer et al .    in the presence of drt03 3 , there is no emission from the location of drt03 3 , though emission is detected towards the other two mid - infrared sources on the field .    our new observations of this field with gemini have revealed the presence of four more faint mid - infrared sources present ( figure 3 ) in addition to those already found by de buizer et al .    it appears that this may be a small cluster of star formation centered on the o9 We will use the parameter @xmath39 , defined as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cmu density distribution for the same @xmath41 and @xmath38 , and @xmath42 is a measure of the degree of flattening ( hartmann et al . \u0013 the remaining parameters that define the density distribution of the @xmath42-envelopes can be set by using the parameter @xmath42 , defined as @xmath42 where @xmath42 is a measure of the degree of flattening in these envelopes is measured by the parameter @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the outer radius of the envelope and @xmath45 is the scale height . ÃÂ hereafter , we will designate them as @xmath42-envelopes . ÃÂ the scale of this density distribution can be set by using the parameter @xmath46 , defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a reference radius . ÃÂ this reference density corresponds to the density that a spherically symmetric free - falling envelope with the same mass accretion rate , @xmath27 , would have at the reference radius @xmath48 . in our modeling ÃÂ , we @xmath0 m images .     in summary , figure 4 , where it is shown that the emission of the envelope with @xmath61 au dominates in the near - infrared range , while the emission of the @xmath62 au envelope dominates at longer wavelengths .     as shown in the figure , this result is valid both for low and relatively high inclination angles , although we note that the point where the small @xmath38 envelope becomes dominant shifts slightly to longer wavelengths when increasing the inclination angle ( from @xmath63 m for @xmath57 to @xmath64 m for @xmath58 ) .    this shift occurs because envelopes seen at higher inclination angles are more opaque , thus requiring a longer wavelength ( where the opacity is lower ) for the small @xmath38 envelope to become dominant .    since we expect the value of @xmath38 to be of the order of the radius of a possible circumstellar disk , in our modeling we will explore a range of values for @xmath38 from tens to hundreds of aus , depending on the luminosity of the source .    since we expect the value of @xmath38 to be of the order of the radius of a possible circumstellar disk , in our modeling we will explore a range of these distant sources from contamination of other sources in their vicinity .     table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and therefore , in general , the far - infrared data are considered only as upper limits and we have to use the mid - infrared data to obtain a range of possible values for the luminosity .       table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and thus , the general strategy was to first run a set of models with increasing luminosities until we found a value that was able to reproduce the observed mid - infrared flux density near the peak of the sed and consistent with the millimeter and submillimeter data .      table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and    table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and     table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and    table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model seds , and    table [ tbl5 ] lists the parameters of our best fit model s Our best fit model is obtained by assuming too much emission at 18.3 and 24.6 @xmath0 m .     in order to reproduce the observational data in the 18 - 25 @xmath0 m wavelength range , we require models with a high inclination angle . our best fit model is obtained for a high inclination angle , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 2@xmath84 g @xmath80 ( @xmath85 ) , and @xmath81 au ( solid line in figure [ fig5 ] ) .    in order to reproduce the observational data in the 18 - 25 @xmath0 m wavelength range , we require models with a high inclination angle , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 2@xmath84 g @xmath80 ( @xmath85 ) , and @xmath81 au ( solid line in figure [ fig5 ] ) .    in order to reproduce the observational data in the 18 - 25 @xmath0 m wavelength range , we require models with a high inclination angle , for example , a model with @xmath88 au is also feasible ( dotted line in figure [ fig5 ] ) .    in order to reproduce the we do not expect the development of an region in the g29 hmpo .    in order to illustrate the relevance of the millimeter constraints , in figure [ fig6 ] we show an additional model ( dotted - line ) , obtained by fitting only the mid - infrared observations .    in order to illustrate the relevance of the millimeter constraints , in figure [ fig6 ] we show an additional model ( dotted - line ) , obtained by fitting only the mid - infrared observations .    in order to illustrate the relevance of the millimeter constraints , in figure [ fig6 ] we show an additional model ( dotted - line ) , obtained by fitting only the mid - infrared observations .     in order to illustrate the relevance of the mid - infrared data , we obtain a value of the luminosity of only 2400 @xmath76 , a density scale of @xmath99 g @xmath80 and an envelope mass of @xmath3 98  @xmath14 .     in order to illustrate the relevance of the mid - infrared data , this set of parameters fits very well the mid - infrared data ; however the model predicts far too little emission at long wavelengths , underestimating by almost one order of magnitude We have obtained mid - infrared data for four hmpo candidates at gemini observatory .    we have obtained mid - infrared data for four hmpo candidates at gemini observatory .     these data have the subarcsecond angular resolution necessary to isolate the emission of the hmpo candidates from that of nearby sources .       the data are well - sampled across the entire 2 to 25 @xmath6 atmospheric windows , and particularly throughout the 10 @xmath6 absorption feature .        since this wavelength range is very sensitive to the source geometry , we have constructed a grid of sed models for the physical conditions ( density , temperature , luminosity ) expected for the early stages of massive star formation , and taking into account for the first time the rotation as well as the natural flattening of the infalling envelopes .      these models reach a degree of complexity comparable to those developed for low - mass protostars . using our mid - infrared data , as well as the far - infrared and millimeter constraints available in the literature thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and useful comments . thoughtful review of our manuscript and",

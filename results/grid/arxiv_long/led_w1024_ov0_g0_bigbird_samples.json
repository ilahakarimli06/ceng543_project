law , @xmath0 , with an index of -3.41 , which is closer to that of an nfw profile of -3 , than -3.71 . <n> we show that the mass of the central region , and the central density of the dark matter , can be as large as a few times of the gravitational mass of our galaxy , for dark matter density profile with a power law index of -2 , _<n> i.e. _ , the density distribution is not a simple power law . on the other hand , if we assume that the fraction of the total mass density that is in the form of fermions is proportional to the density of dark matter<n> , then the mass profile can be approximated by a log - normal distribution with a slope of -2.68 , that is , a constant degeneracy pressure . since the value of the zero temperature deg gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the large - scale structure of the universe .<n> however , it is well - known that the density profile of lensing clusters is strongly affected by the presence of galaxies at the center of the cluster . here<n> we show that light fermions , which may account for a significant fraction of the entire dark matter , can account for the volume density profile observed in gravitationally lensed cluster of galaxies , provided that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. , the gas pressure is equal to the pressure of collisionless non -

in other words  we consider a situation when @xmath0 stochastic variables evolve according to identical independent processes .<n> this is a simple generalization of the standard univariate weak stationary moving average , and we derive the spectral properties of the pearson estimator of this correlated wishart random matrix . in particular , we show that the spectral gap between the true pearson and the one obtained using the cross covariance matrix grows logarithmically with the number of variables , in contrast to the linear behavior found in the case of univariate processes , where it grows linearly with the sample size . <n> the study of temporal correlations among a set of random variables is a long - standing problem in statistical physics . since the seminal work of lindblad and boltzmann @xcite on autocovariance matrices ,<n> the subject has experienced a great deal of activity , both theoretical and experimental . despite the fact that the covariance between variables has been extensively studied , it is still not completely understood what the temporal correlations between different variables are , what their form is , or even what their spectral properties are . to this end<n> , there has been a considerable amount of work done on the subject , mostly in two directions : ( we introduce a general framework for the analysis of covariance matrices of time series .<n> it is based on the concept of an auto covariance matrix , which is defined as the inverse of the auto covariant matrix of a corresponding @xmath0 process . in this framework<n> , we introduce the notion of a green function , and we derive a set of equations for the green function and its coefficients , as well as the coefficients of the pearson estimator , valid for time series with covariances that are gaussian , exponential , or doubly exponential decays , depending on the type of correlation between the components . <n> we apply our approach to the case of four - dimensional autocovariance matrices , for which we find explicit expressions for the coefficients and the green functions . as an example of application ,<n> we consider the time series generated by two independent and identically distributed stochastic processes , each of them described by a vector autoregressive ( or vector ) process ; we show that , under certain conditions , our green functions are equivalent to pearson s ones , that is , they are polynomials with coefficients that are functions of the time variable , . we derive a theoretical formula for the cross covariances in the correlated wishart random matrix process , @xmath0 , where the auto covariance matrix of the var process is the same as that of the corresponding vma process .<n> the theoretical formula is valid in the thermodynamical limit of the process parameters , and in the limit of infinite time . as an application<n> , we show that the cross - covariance function of the wishart process can be approximated by that of a var process with the same process parameters but a different cross - correlation covariance . <n> mark kambites + _ school of mathematics and statistics , university of manchester , + manchester m13 9pl , england _ <n> +  mark.kambites@manchester.ac.uk  _ in the last decade or so , the theory of stochastic processes has become an indispensable tool in the study of the stochastic properties of systems with many degrees of freedom . in particular , it has played a key role in the development of the statistical mechanics theory of gaussian processes @xcite , in the derivation of the boltzmann - gibbs statistics of the free energy @x we study the varma parameter dependence of the cross covariances in the @xmath0 process .<n> we assign different varma parameters to the cross - covariance matrices associated with this process , and , in the thermodynamical limit , we show that , as a function of these parameters , the process converges to a unique equilibrium point . in this case<n> , there is no thermodynamic limit ; instead , it is possible to define a thermodynamically non - equilibrium point of the process at which the cross <n> covariance matrix is equal to zero , with a probability proportional to the square of the logarithm of the number of varma . <n> the study of the thermodynamic properties of physical systems is one of the major challenges in statistical mechanics , due to the ever - increasing interest in the role of thermodynamics in natural and social systems @xcite . among the many thermodynamic properties that are studied experimentally ,<n> the one that is most relevant in the context of statistical mechanics is the entropy , which is defined as the difference between the energy and the hamiltonian energy of the system , expressed in terms of the boltzmann weight of the entropy operator . for a system in equilibrium  we introduce the concept of the autocovariance matrix of a stochastic process .<n> it quantifies the degree of covariance of temporally separated components of the process , and can be used to describe stochastic processes where the covariances are not necessarily of the same sign . as an example , we consider the varma model , which is a stochastic version of the ising model in two dimensions . in the thermodynamical limit<n> , the auto covariance matrix decays as @xmath0 , while in the random limit , it decays exponentially , with an exponent that depends on the process size . <n> _ introduction _ stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology and finance ; they play an important role in many fields of science , ranging from the study of bacterial colonies @xcite to the dynamics of chemical reactions in the cell , from the distribution of molecules in a cell to the rate at which information spreads across a cell . for a process to be stochastic , its covariance must be non - zero ; in particular , in the presence of disorder , this is the case in many physical systems , where it is known as the _ auto we present a free random variables ( frv ) calculus for multivariate stochastic processes of the varma type .<n> we derive a formula for the mean spectral density of the @xmath0 process , which is expressed in terms of the moments generating function of the sample covariance and the population covariance , and we show that the latter may be easily derived from the former . in particular , we establish a closed - form expression for the covariance matrix of varma process and we prove that it is polynomial of order six . <n> the frv calculus is ideally suited for multidimensional time series problems , provided the dimensions of the underlying matrices are large . since the majority of data collected nowadays is naturally stored in the form of huge matrices , it is natural to search for efficient algorithms for cleaning ( de noising ) large sets of data and unraveling essential but hidden correlations . to this end , in this paper we attempted to advertise the power and flexibility of the free random variable calculus , based on the matrix - valued formalism , for the analysis of multivariate time series , including those with heavy tailed increments belonging to the lvy basin of attraction , where the moments do not exist . as a we present a translationally invariant theory for the covariance matrix of a stochastic process @xmath0 , based on the exponential decays of its auto covariance matrices .<n> this theory is applied to the case of a general stochastic process , and we derive the exact form of its green s function . <n> [ [ section ] ] the theory of stochastic processes has a long history , going back to kolmogorov s time . for the first time<n> , we are in a situation where a process can be seen as the sum of two parts , one deterministic and the other stochastic . in the deterministic part ,<n> the process is given by the hamiltonian , while in the stochastic part it is the stochastic process itself , which is the object of the analysis . as a result of this<n> there has been a vast amount of work on stochastic processes , both deterministic and stochastic , with a particular emphasis on the role played by the process s autocovariance matrix @xcite . the most famous and well - known example is provided by the stochastic schrdinger equation , for which there is a remarkable agreement between the predictions of monte carlo simulations we consider the pearson estimator of the covariances of a multivariate random matrix , @xmath0 , where the coefficients of the exponential decays of the entries of the matrix are free random variables .<n> we show that , if the coefficients are real and positive , the estimator is the law of addition ( s.e . ) ; otherwise , it is a non - crossing partition ( nw.)@xmath1 . the sixth order polynomial equation obeyed by this s function<n> is obtained , and its solution is explicitly given . in the case of @xxmath2 ,<n> the s - function is given explicitly , as well as its solution in closed form . for the special case of a quadratic covariance matrix <n> , we give the exact solution , in terms of the kernel of the polynomial equation , which is a function of the coefficients . as an example , using this result , an explicit formula for the limiting spectral distribution of the sample covariance matrices generated by varma , laloux , cizeau and bouchaud , is derived . *<n> key words and phrases : * pearson  we introduce the concept of spectral moments of correlated wishart matrices .<n> the spectral moments are the moments of the eigenvalue density of the empirical covariance matrix , which can be calculated from the time series of the correlation matrix . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the analysis of financial time series . <n> correlation matrices play an important role in signal processing and computational finance @xcite . in the field of financial analysis ,<n> the most used method for the estimation of the parameters of the underlying model is the so - called wishart matrix ( gsm ) @xmath0 , where the gsm is defined as the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of entries of a random variable ( rxv ) , obtained by averaging over all possible values of the variable s parameters . for a given number of rxvs , the pdf of gsm<n> is known as the _ spectral moment _ of the model , denoted by the symbol sjm@xmath1 for the case of _ random _ correlation matrix ( rcm ) and _ real - valued _ <n> covariance matrices ( cvms ) for the",

first - passage - time ( mfpt we introduce a new markov chain characterization , called the hill relation , which generalizes exact sampling to the setting of exact milestoning .<n> we then show how this relation can be used to derive the stationary distribution of a markovian process . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @xcite , where we introduced a new stochastic process , the  hill relation '' , for which we defined exact sampling . in that paper , we considered a markov process @xmath0 , defined as the product of two markov chains , one with source and one with sink . here ,<n> we define the second ,  source '' and  sink '' as the probability that the two chains reach a common stationary distribution . for the hill relations , that is , when the probability of hitting the same stationary distribution is equal to one , this is the well - known result ; for the markov processes , it is the probability to hit a particular stationary distribution that is important , as this is a measure of how close we are to hitting a milestone in the sampling process  in this paper , we show that when @xmath0 , the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system interacting with a noisy electromagnetic field can be written as a convex combination of two hamiltonians , one of which is a linear combination of harmonic oscillators .<n> we use this result to give a new proof of a well - known result in quantum optics , namely , that when the coupling between the system and the electromagnetic field exceeds a critical value , then the system is always in a mixed state . <n> _ introduction _ the study of quantum systems interacting with noisy fields has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite . in particular ,<n> the problem of describing the quantum state of a system in the presence of a noisy field has attracted much attention , both from a theoretical and a practical point of view . for a classical system , this problem can be formulated as follows : suppose that the field is a damped harmonic oscillator ( h oscillator ) , and that the coupling strength between the field and the oscillator is a quadratic function of the amplitude of the oscillation . here<n> , a quadratic - to - linear coupling term is added to the damping term @x in this paper , we show that the number of @xmath0-parametrized entanglement witnesses required to prove the nonlocality of a bipartite bell inequality is @xxmath1 .<n> we also show that this bound is sharp . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] in his thesis , bell studied a class of inequalities @xcite , namely , the inequalities between the expectation of a pair of observables and the maximally entangled state of the system . in these inequalities ,<n> the state of a system is bounded from below by its expectation of the maximal entangled state , and the state from above by the average of the two observables . for a system of two particles , such as a spin-1/2 particle in a uniform magnetic field , these inequalities are the well - known bell inequalities . here<n> we consider a similar type of inequality , which is based on the following statement :  _ _ a bipartition of the set of all observables in the system is given by the product of the expected number of maximal entangled states of a given system and the probability distribution of the values of the observables on the two sides of the partition . on the other we present a new proof of a well - known result in quantum optics , namely , that the phase of a photon scattered by a laser beam can be described by a single function @xmath0 .<n> we show that this single function can be written as the sum of two terms , one which is proportional to the phase and the other which is a function of the wave vector . as a consequence<n> , we obtain a closed - form expression for the phase in terms of the two - photon correlation function . <n> the study of the phase diagram of a quantum system is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory . in quantum mechanics ,<n> a phase is defined as the state that can not be reproduced exactly by any classical mechanical system , and is invariant under time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) @xcite . for a system described by an effective hamiltonian , the phase can be expressed as the product of a phase and a wave function , which is called the _ phase _ of the system . the phase obtained from the phase<n> is known as the wave function and it is , therefore , an important quantity . on the other hand , for in this paper , we consider a bipartite quantum system consisting of a @xmath0 dimensional harmonic oscillator and a single - mode bosonic field .<n> we assume that the coupling between the oscillator and the field is weak , and we study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system as the coupling strength is varied . in the limit of weak coupling ,<n> the system is described by the schrdinger equation , while in the opposite limit , when the coupling is strong , the schdinger equation is recovered . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the asymptotic properties of quantum many - body systems is one of the main topics in quantum information theory . for a given quantum system , which may be described by an eigenvalue spectrum @xcite or a hilbert space of eigenstates , there is a class of coupled quantum systems , called _ eigenmodes _ , that can be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , also known as _ partial differential equations _ ( pde ) or _ wave equations_. in particular , it is well known that the wave equation we present a new proof of a theorem by aristoff and rousset [ phys . rev . <n> lett . * 84 * , 2993 ( 2000 ) ] .<n> our proof is based on a generalization of the mori - zwanzig projection formalism , which we call the _ projection operator _<n> , and which allows us to prove the theorem in a way that is independent of previous work on the subject . as an example , we show that , in the case of the nonrelativistic dirac equation , the projection operator can be written as the sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the dirac wave function , while the other is a non - dirac - like term . in the special case where both terms are proportional to each other ,<n> the result is equivalent to the well - known result that the wave function of the system is given by the product of its two dirac cones . since the theorem is valid for all values of the coupling constant , it can be used to prove a theorem on the existence of bound states in dirac equations , even in the absence of symmetries ",

site coulomb repulsion on the dot ,<n> the decay rates of charge and spin are of the same order of magnitude , while for a non - interacting quantum dot they can be much larger than the single - particle decay rate @xmath0 . as a result , the time - dependent probability distribution of the quantum dot can be qualitatively different from that of a simple fermi liquid . <n> the quantum many - body state of a system of interacting particles is of fundamental importance in many areas of physics . in particular<n> , it is of central importance for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in metals @xcite , for the interaction - induced enhancement of the critical temperature in the bcs - bec transition in semiconductors ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs.@xcite and references therein ) , and for the quantum coherence properties in strongly correlated electron systems (see , in particular , rev.j.phys. we study the relaxation of charge , spin , and orbital angular momentum in a one - dimensional quantum wire with coulomb interaction .<n> we show that the charge relaxation is exponentially suppressed as the interaction strength increases , whereas the spin and orbital relaxation rates decay as power laws , depending on the tunnel coupling @xmath0 and the dot level position . in the presence of a magnetic field ,<n> the charge and spin relaxation rates are suppressed as well , in agreement with recent experimental observations . <n> quantum wire systems with strong electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are well described by the hubbard model , @xcite which has been shown to be appropriate to describe a variety of physical systems , such as quantum dots , quantum wires , superconducting circuits , josephson junction arrays , carbon nanotubes , etc ..<n> however , it is not known how the interaction affects the relaxation rate of the system , except in the limit of zero or very small interaction , where the system is in its ground state . as a result , the interaction - induced relaxation rate is not directly observable in experiments , although it has been predicted theoretically ,@xcite and verified experimentally  we consider the time evolution of electrons and holes in an interacting quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime .<n> we find that the electron - hole symmetric point of the anderson model is reached at a certain value of the interaction strength , @xmath0 , where the charge relaxation rate follows the mean squared deviation of the charge from its equilibrium value . at this value ,<n> the andersen model is equivalent to the noninteracting case , with a relaxation rate that does not depend on the interaction . <n> pacs numbers : 73.23.hk , 73.40.gk , 71.35.-y . in interacting quantum systems , the interaction of electrons with the lattice degrees of freedom can lead to a number of phenomena , such as the mott transition @xcite , or the formation of charge density waves ( cdw ) , which have been observed in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) in the presence of strong electron - electron interactions . however , it is well - known that in these systems the interaction is screened by the surrounding lattice , leading to the appearance of a different type of screening , that is , inelastic scattering @x we show that the electron dynamics in a quantum dot coupled to a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) can be controlled by tuning the gate potential and the strength of the on - site repulsion .<n> the dynamics is governed by a single relaxation rate , which can be extracted from a measurement of the occupation of a single quantum dot state with a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) . <n> the recent realization of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) coupled to 2d electron gases @xcite has opened a new chapter in the field of semiconductor nanodevices . in these systems ,<n> the electron - electron interaction in the 2deg is screened by the surrounding 2d gas , giving rise to an effective two - particle interaction @xmath0 between the electrons . as a result , in the limit of a weak coupling between the 2d system and the bulk , the dynamics of the electron distribution in the qd is described by the anderson hamiltonian , where the single particle occupation of the dot is known to be a linear function of the interaction strength . for sufficiently strong coupling , however , a non - linear dependence of the single - particle occupation on the electron density emerges we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) in the presence of a coulomb interaction .<n> we show that the relaxation rate of the qpc is determined by the strength @xmath0 of the tunnel coupling between the point contact and the quantum dot , while the relaxation rates of the charge and the spin are determined by their mutual repulsion . in the limit of weak tunnel coupling ,<n> we recover the well - known exponential decay of the quantum point - contact current . for stronger tunnel coupling<n> , we find a non - monotonic behavior of the current as a function of the strength of the on - site interaction , which can be understood in terms of a renormalization of the inter - dot distance . <n> quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) are devices that can be used to monitor the dynamics of charge and spin currents in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite . as such , they have found numerous potential applications in quantum information processing , quantum simulation , as well as in quantum computing @x<n> . however , their study has been limited so far to the case of a single qd in contact with a heat bath . we study the electron transport through a quantum dot weakly coupled to two normal and two superconducting leads .<n> we focus on the effects of cotunneling between the dot and the leads , induced by the proximity of a superconducting or a ferromagnetic reservoir . using a @xmath0-renormalization group approach<n> , we find that the spin and charge relaxation rates of the quantum dot are dominated by co tunneling processes . <n> quantum dots ( qds ) are promising candidates for spintronics devices @xcite , due to their spin degree of freedom and the possibility to manipulate and detect the spin state of a single qd by means of electrical means . in particular , the transport properties of a qd can be tuned by application of an external magnetic field , e.g. , by coupling it to a normal conductor , or to a superconducting ( sc ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) reservoir , such as a liquid helium ( li ) crystal or a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . as a result ,<n> the qd provides an ideal system to study the interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon ( eop ) interactions , which is of we study the time evolution of the charge and spin of a quantum dot coupled to a superconductor with tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 and to a normal lead .<n> we find that the mixing of the empty and doubly occupied states of the dot leads to a non - monotonic time - dependence of the relaxation rate of the charged particle , which is a direct consequence of the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes . <n> quantum dots ( qds ) coupled to superconductors ( ss s) and normal leads ( nl ) have been proposed as building blocks for future solid - state devices @xcite . in a nl - s system ,<n> electrons are confined to a single qd and superconductivity is induced by the proximity effect , while in a qd - nl system the electrons form a double dot and the superconductor acts as a normal metal . due to the strong electron - electron interaction , the charge in the qd<n> is mixed with the nl electrons and vice versa , leading to a strong renormalization of the tunnel coupling between the dot and s , and also to an increase of the effective mass of the double dot , @ we investigate the effect of a superconducting contact on the electron dynamics in a quantum dot coupled to two reservoirs .<n> we show that the presence of a ferromagnetic contact breaks the spin symmetry of the system and leads to an enhancement of the spin - dependent relaxation rate , while the ferromagnetic coupling does not change this rate . <n> electronic transport in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has been the subject of intense research due to its potential applications in the field of spintronics @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been shown that the spin of the electrons in a qd can be manipulated by applying an external magnetic field , for example , by means of a gate voltage @xmath0 , which can be used to switch the qd between two different states : one with zero spin and the other with a spin - polarized spin . as a result ,<n> the spin polarization of the electron can be changed by the magnetic field and the corresponding change in the spin state of the charge can be tuned by the gate voltage . on the other hand , in order to achieve the same effect in a semiconductor qd , one has to introduce a magnetic contact into the system , such as a normal metal we study the charge and spin relaxation in a quantum dot ( qd ) with coulomb interaction and tunnel coupled to a single reservoir .<n> we find that the time evolution of the square deviations of the charge from its equilibrium value is related to processes involving two particles in the dot . in the hybrid normal - superconducting system ,<n> we show that the rate at which the charge decays can be extracted from time - resolved measurements of the current passing through a nearby quantum point contact . <n> quantum dots are promising building blocks for future quantum information devices @xcite . as a result<n> , they have been extensively studied in the last years , as well as their quantum transport properties , in order to understand the interplay between charge transport , spin transport and superconductivity in these systems . here , we present a detailed study of the relaxation dynamics of a single - level qd in the presence of both coulombic and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , by means of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method . for the first time , the evolution of a charge and a spin in a qd coupled to two reservoirs is studied , taking into we investigate the effect of electron - electron interactions on the spin dynamics of a quantum dot .<n> we find that the spin of the quantum dot is strongly affected by these interactions , with the spin state of the dot decaying exponentially with the number of electrons in the dot , @xmath0 , and the spin - orbit coupling strongly affecting the spin relaxation dynamics . in particular , we show that the dot can remain in the zeeman - split state , where the spin is completely frozen , for long times . <n> quantum dots are promising systems for the implementation of quantum information processing @xcite , due to their long coherence times and the ease with which spin - dependent processes can be carried out in them . however , the dynamics of the spin states of these systems is not well understood , despite the fact that they are interacting with each other through the exchange of a large number of electron spins . as a result ,<n> the spin properties of quantum dots have been the subject of much interest , both theoretically and experimentally , over the past few years . despite the success of experimental techniques in the manipulation of quantum dot spin states , there is still a pressing need for an understanding of the mechanisms by",

level atom , whose hamiltonian is known to be exactly conjugate to that of a linear superposition of two harmonic oscillators , and whose semiclassical eigenvalues can be calculated exactly . the method is based on the fact that each periodic point of the unitary map is associated with a gaussian distribution in hilbert space . from this distribution ,<n> we can obtain a positive definite approximation to the quantum distribution . for a unitary map , the probability density of the state @x we propose a new representation of phase space in terms of a unitary operator of hilbert bargmann space .<n> this representation is up to a phase and has a real positive spectrum . <n> [ [ section ] ] it has been known for a long time that the phase space of a hamiltonian system can be decomposed into two parts , phase space @xcite and hyperbolic phase space , @xmath0 , where the first is the coordinate space and the second is the momentum space ; see , e.g. , refs . and references therein . in this paper<n> , we will show that this decomposition can be extended to a hilbert space in which the state space is a husimi representation of a linear symplectic transformation in phase space which is the product of two real positive functions , one on each side of the complex plane . as an example we will use this representation to study the dynamics of a particle moving in a harmonic potential , in the presence of an external magnetic field , and we will compare the results with the case of a chaotic cavity . for a chaotic system , it is well known that the trajectory of the particle has a maslov index we consider the dynamics of a particle confined in a harmonic oscillator and driven by a time - dependent external field .<n> we show that the motion of the particle can be described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , the hamiltonian of which is the product of a gaussian continuous variable ( cv ) with a time dependent variable ( tdv ) which describes the time evolution of the state of the system . in this picture ,<n> the time dependence of the cv is due to a _ time - evolution _ ( te ) term in the cv which is not present in the sdes . as an example , we consider a system of two coupled oscillators and show how the te term can be derived from a sdv which describes a time evolution equation ( toe ) for the cv of the second oscillator . <n> pacs numbers : 05.45.+b , 03.65.sq , 05.70.fh , 47.54.+r in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of time dependent systems which are not @xmath0-dimensional @xcite . among these systems<n> are",

[<n> fig.1 ] ] the origin of radio emission in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is still an open question @xcite . in the past few years , a number of theoretical and observational studies have been carried out to understand the radio properties of agn . among them<n> , low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) are characterized by low accretion rates ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) , which are among the lowest among all known galactic nuclei .<n> however , the nature of the accretion flow in these sources is not well understood . in this work , we present a theoretical study of the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 20 nearby , low - mass , broad - line , type iagns ( l2al iafs ) using the relativistic accretion flow ( riaf ) model with hybrid thermal - nonthermal electrons . we find that the radio emission of all but one of these 20 llagrs can be well described by the riafs model , where the observed radio emission is always 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than that from the purely thermal electrons even with only several percent of electron thermal energy injected into the nonthermal electron population . this model has explained the multi - wavelength spectrum of sgr a * very well , and we further extend this model to other nearby llgns which have only a compact radio core and have no evidence of the jet . we investigate the origin of the radio emission in low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) and radio - quiet rq agn , using the two - component ( thermal - nonthermal ) model for the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) .<n> we find that the radio loudness , @xmath0 , of the llgns can be accounted for by a small fraction of the viscous dissipation energy in the accretion flow going into accelerating electrons to a nonthermal power - law distribution , if the fraction is larger than a few percent . in order to account for the low - frequency radio emission of the compact cores in nearby llegns<n> , we suggest that magnetic reconnection should be unavoidable and play an important role in converting the magnetic energy into the nonthermal particles . we find a strong anticorrelation between the mass - corrected radio loudness and the eddington ratio , _<n> i.e. _ , the ratio of the mass of the source to that of the black hole at the center . for the bright rq seyfert 1 galaxy ,<n> vvds j1148 + 5408 , which has a mass of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) are characterized by very low eddington ratios ( @xmath0 ) , and their x - ray emission is believed to be dominated by the thermal emission from the central black hole ( bh ) and/or by the nuclear starbursts . however , it is still unclear whether the radio emission in these objects originates from the bh - driven jets or from the stellar - mass bh x - rays binaries . in this work , we present a theoretical model that can account for the observed radio@xmath1x - ray correlation for a sample of low - eddington agns with bh masses ranging from a few to several tens of solar masses .<n> we find that the radio loudness is anticorrelate with the eddington ratio , where the mass - corrected radio emission is dominated by bh jets , while the contribution from the outer ssd ( if present ) is negligible . our model predicts that the relation between the radio luminosity and the x -ray luminosity is similar to that observed in xrbs ( e.g. , * ? ?<n> * ) or that derived from the observed fundamental plane of bh activity . we study the radio emission from a sample of llagns ( @xmath0 ) observed by the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and find that the low - frequency x - ray emission of most of them can be well fitted by a model including only a small fraction of the energy in nonthermal electrons .<n> we also find that only a few percent to several percent of the turbulent dissipation that directly heats the electrons in the flow is sufficient to produce the x - rays at low frequencies , which suggests that the microphysics in these sources is more or less consistent with that constrained for sgr a * @xcite . <n> the origin of radio emission in low - luminosity , low - accretion - rate ( l@xmath1 ) agns is still a matter of debate . in the past few years<n> , a number of studies have been devoted to investigate this issue . among these studies , we are still lacking a satisfactory model to explain the emission of s gr a * ( e.g. , * ? ?<n> * ) and the emission from the galactic center ( gc ) type 1 agn , i.e.  we present the first results of our monitoring campaign of the galactic microquasar sdss j1148@xmath00135 .<n> the angular resolution of the data is @xmath1 arcsec and the frequency coverage is @ x - ray , uv , optical , and near - ir . using this unique dataset<n> , we have detected continuum emission from the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole at the center of this galaxy , as well as emission lines from the stellar winds of the host galaxy . by combining these data with the broad - band photometry from the sloan digital sky survey ,<n> we have studied the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source , which can be fit by a power - law with a photon index of -1.9 , similar to that of nearby galactic black holes . <n> accretion disks around black holes ( bhs ) are believed to form as a result of the gravitational collapse of massive stars , but the nature of these objects is not well understood @xcite . in the past few years , a number of interesting results have been obtained , such as the discovery of a jet around the black hole in the we present a study of the @xmath0co@xmath1o and cscoo single crystals , using time - of - flight ( tof ) and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements , and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .<n> our dft calculations reveal that the co - existence of co and o ions is a common feature of all the crystals studied , even though they are not co - spatial in the experimental data . in the low - temperature limit ,<n> co is found to form first in the parent compound , while o ions form later in the crystal , consistent with a scenario in which o ions are present only in the early stages of co - evolution . at higher temperatures , however , the formation of o ions becomes more common than for co - forming co - ions , due to an increase in the kinetic energy of the o ions relative to that of the co atoms . <n> the search for rare earth ( re ) asteroids has been one of the major focuses of the planetary and astrophysical communities since the discovery of the chondrite meteorites in 1986 @xcite . among the many asteroids that have been studied in in this letter , we propose a new method to determine the redshifts of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .<n> the method is based on the fact that the luminosity function ( lf ) of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) can be approximated by a power law , @xmath0 , with an exponential cut - off at _ finite _ luminosities . by fitting the model to the lfs of nearby agn ,<n> we show that the mean redshift of the type ic seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc 6946 , can be determined to within a few percent accuracy . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : active - quasars : general - _ contribution to the proceedings of the workshop on _<n> radiative transfer in snia : from accretion to black hole growth _ in beijing , china , may 23 - 27 , 2013 _ the study of sni type ib / ic ( sn ib ) supernovae is important for the understanding of the physics of sn ia @xcite . in a",

( 2 ) e25 must be expanding at an even lower rate than predicted ; and ( 3 ) there must be some other source of ionization other than hydrogen in e25 . the planetary nebula ngc 6543 was observed with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the [ o iii ] @xmath0 , [ n ii ] and h@xmath1 lines between 1997 and 1994 .<n> the nebular surface brightness was determined from the acs images to be about 2 magnitudes fainter than that measured in 1994 , and the angular expansion rate in mas was measured to be approximately constant over the time interval covered by the observations . a conceptual geometric model of the nebula was developed to account for the difference in expansion rates between the two nebular components . <n> ng c 6543 is a planetary nebula ( pn ) located at a distance of about 300 pc and harbors two bright polar caps , one of which ( f502n ) is located at the center of the pn and has a diameter of about 30 pc , while the other ( s ii ) has a smaller diameter and is located in the foreground at about 100 pc . the two polar caps are separated by about 10 pc in projection on the sky , with a projected separation of about 1 pc ;

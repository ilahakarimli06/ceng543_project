we study the effect of anisotropic pressure hessian on the probability distribution in a homogeneous viscous flow in two - dimensions .<n> we show that , in addition to the well known @xmath0 probability current along the vieillefosse line , a probability current is also pushed toward vanishing velocity and velocity gradient , such that a divergence - free full probability current can be created . in particular , we find that the velocity gradient along a lagrangian trajectory is pushed by the pressure , while it is  pushed '' by the deterministic euler term along the left part of the plane such that the deterministic re -

vanishing and that vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the eigenvector of the strain - rate tensor corresponding to the intermediate eigenvalue . using this velocity field ,<n> we compute the probability current and show that it can be approximated by a pad approximant with scaling and squaring . <n> turbulence is one of the most important phenomena in modern physics , and plays an important role in a wide range of fields , from physics of fluid dynamics to biology and ecology . in the last decades<n> , turbulence has been studied extensively both experimentally @xcite and theoretically , in order to better understand and predict the behavior of complex fluids in a variety of contexts , ranging from the earth s crust to the planetary atmosphere . over the last two decades , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the development of theoretical and numerical models of turbulence , with the aim of understanding and predicting the properties of turbulence that occur in nature . despite the great progress that has been made , we present direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of turbulent flows with three different types of synthetic velocity fields : gaussian , multifractal , and minimal turnover lagrangian maps .<n> we compare the numerical results with the probability currents , probability flux , vorticity stretching and enstrophy in turbulent flows . in all three cases ,<n> the dns results are in good agreement with the predictions of the navier - stokes equations . <n> turbulent flows are ubiquitous in nature and technology , but they are also one of the most challenging problems in fluid dynamics , since they involve instabilities , turbulence , dissipation and reynolds stresses , etc @xcite . despite their complexity<n> , turbulent flows can be modeled reasonably well using numerical techniques , such as direct numerical simulation ( dns)@xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . here<n> we show that three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations can be used as a powerful tool to study turbulent flows in general , with applications ranging from the study of micro - turbulence to the modeling of large - scale transport phenomena such as oceanic currents and heat transport . for turbulent flows<n>  we present a numerical study of anisotropic pressure anisotropy in synthetic velocity fields .<n> the velocity fields are obtained from a hierarchy of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations , and the resulting velocity field is shown to reproduce the main features of realistic turbulence , in particular , the probability current and the void of probability in the pressure -

trivial behavior of the probability current , and the conditional expectation of thepressure hessian norm on the invariant @xmath0 . also , the simplest gaussian approximation for the velocity field can represent some non -trivial behaviors of the pressures that could not be predicted by the closures in terms of * a * @xcite . then , based on an exact field description of the hessian by means of nonlocal integrals , local closures involving a finite set of ordinary differential equations<n> are proposed , for studying the statistical nature of this hessian . <n> lagrangin dynamics is a powerful tool for the study of turbulence , as it allows us to follow the evolution of a large number of parameters in a time - ordered fashion , starting from an initial value problem . in the simplest case , that of a homogeneous and isotropic fluid ,<n> the dynamics is governed by the velocity - gradient tensor @x the velocity gradient tensor of an incompressible fluid is a key quantity in the physics of turbulence .<n> it plays a key role in the description of the transition from a turbulent to a laminar regime , and in the prediction of the turbulent reynolds number . here<n> , we investigate the dynamics of the velocity - gradient tensor in an inviscid homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and stochastic simulations ( ss ) . for an early time<n> @xmath0 , the dynamics is dominated by the mixing of the subgrid - scale velocity field , while for later times the velocity field is decoupled from the fluid . in the latter case ,<n> the lagrangian description is less satisfactory , as the velocity gradients are not governed by a transport equation , but by poisson s equation . at later times , however , they follow the recently proposed closure of the pressure hessian by matrix exponentials @xcite . <n> turbulence is one of the most important physical systems in which to study its dynamics , since it is characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom , that can interact with each other in a non -

accelerated hydrodynamical parallel code ( _ gamer _ ) developed at the national taiwan university .<n> the parallel performance has been highly optimized by implementing ( 1 ) hybrid mpi / openmp / gpu parallelization , ( 2 ) concurrent execution between multiple cpus and gpus ; ( 3 ) asynchronous data transfer from cpus to gpus and ( 4 ) hilbert space - filling curve for load balancing . the code supports a variety of hydrodynamic schemes . in this work<n> we adopt the corner - transport - upwind method , roe s riemann solver , and the piecewise parabolic data reconstruction schemes , which are found to result in the overall performance using these schemes being @xmath0 cell updates per second on a single nvidia k40 gpu which is two orders of magnitude faster than a single cpu core and one order of magnitude slower than a ten - core cpu using an intel xeon e5 - 2670 v2 cpu at 2.50 ghz . we present simulations relevant to our qualitative analysis of colliding extragalactic jets .<n> we performed simulations of two bipolar jets with different injection velocities , cross sections , densities , and temperatures for the jets and the ambient gas . for future applications in mind , we chose the physical parameters of our jet system to match those derived for 3c 75 based on radio and x - ray observations @xcite . we simulated both sides of the two bipolar jet to model 3c75 in a simulation box size of 20 kpc @xmath0 100 kpc@xmath1 10 kpc . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] the kinematics and dynamics of colliding jets are not well understood . in particular<n> , it is not clear how the jet cross section , the initial jet velocity , or the jet temperature affect the subsequent evolution of the jet system . as a result ,<n> jets are often assumed to propagate through an ambient medium with an initial density and temperature that are in equipartition with the ambient medium . at the same time , in the ideal gas approximation , there is no gas equipartition at the base of the outflow , since the gas density is we report the discovery of a jet - jet interaction in the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) 3c 75 and pks 2155 - 304 .<n> the morphology and kinematics of these sources are similar to those of the jet sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , suggesting that they are powered by the same supermassive black hole in the center of each source . <n> jet sources are powerful sources of relativistic outflows ( @xmath0kev ) in the energy range of 10@xmath1erg , which are thought to be powered by black holes in the centers of galaxies . in the lmc @xcite , these jets produce bipolar outflows , whose morphologies are similar ( though not identical ) to those observed in radio - quiet quasars and x - ray binaries . here<n> we show that these jets can collide with each other , leading to the formation of a new bipolar jet source ( pbh ) and a new type of agn , the jet - rich seyfert 1 galaxy 3c 25 , located at a projected distance of 7.5 kpc from the jet source pbh in the agn 3c75  we perform three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of two relativistic jets in the early stage of the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) at @xmath0 = 200 gev .<n> we show that the interaction between the two jets leads to a strong increase in the projected energy density of the collision region , and , as a consequence , to a significant modification of the energy spectra of the produced particles . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) are among the most violent events in the history of the universe , with more than 200 pb@xmath1 produced in a single rhic event @xcite . in the first stage of a hic ,<n> the energy release in each individual nucleon - nucleon collision is comparable , but the total energy of the system is much larger than that of the individual nucleons . as a result , a large fraction of the initial energy is released in the form of relativistic particles , leading to the formation of a hot , dense matter , called the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) , which is one of the main candidates for the state of matter produced in these collisions @x we study the dynamics of relativistic jets produced by the gravitational collapse of a star . in our study , we use a hydrodynamical model with @xmath0 particles , which includes the effects of s - wave turbulence .<n> we find that the collapse results in the formation of two types of jets : ( 1 ) colliding jets which bounce off each other and survive as individuals and ( 2 ) merging jets which break up into oscillating filaments and merge with each other . <n> stars form in dense stellar matter due to gravitational collapse ( gsm ) , a process which can be described in terms of two - dimensional ( 2d ) ideal hydrodynamics @xcite . during the collapse ,<n> matter is swept up by the gravity wave field , and as a result , jets are formed , each with a specific velocity and direction . at the same time , the energy density in the two - jet system is reduced because of the energy transfer between the two jets . as a consequence , during the collision , only one jet seems to emerge , but after the collision two jets can be seen , depending on the impact parameter and velocity difference between them . here<n> , we show that , in the hydrodynamical version of the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) equation of state , the system supports two distinct regimes of jet formation : ( i ) bouncing jets , where fast jets collide with each other and travel ballistically away from the point of collision ; and ( ii ) merging jets where the energy density of the system grows rapidly with the impact parameter of the colliding jets .<n> the width of the energy distribution of merging jets is larger than that of bouncing jets ( i.e. , @xmath0 times  rm maxe_z[15,y]$ ] ) , and it grows with the mach number of the jet , rather than with the total energy density , as in the bhf case . <n> collisions of jets are expected to occur in astrophysical objects of all scales . in dense astrophysical regions , such as the cores of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) @xcite , heavy - ion collisions in the centers of galaxies , or the nucleus - nucleus collisions in galaxy clusters , collisions of compact objects produce relativistic jets when two jets collide in a collisionless environment , the instabilities in the jets increase , and as they propagate , they generate more turbulence and drive more waves as they generate , as they collide , more waves . in this paper , we study the collision of two relativistic jets propagating through an ambient medium .<n> the jets collide when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small . as a consequence of this collision ,<n> the spread of the jets increases . when the jets merge the spread is limited because a second jet disappears . for small impact parameters and small velocity gradients the two jets merge , otherwise they bounce . <n> collisions of relativistic jets are important in many astrophysical contexts , such as collisions of black holes , collisions of comets , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , etc @xcite . at the highest energies ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 ergs ) , or when the kinetic energy of the collision is comparable to the gravitational energy , jets can collide with an impact parameter as small as @x.1 . here<n> we investigate the properties of collisions of jets with impact parameters in the range @x we perform hydrodynamical simulations of three - dimensional jets colliding in the central rapidity region of the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev .<n> the aim of these simulations is to investigate the properties of the collimated jets and their interactions with each other and with the matter in the immediate surrounding of the rhic hot and dense matter . <n> relativistic jets are produced in the early stages of the collimation of ultrarelativistic heavy ions ( hics ) @xcite . in this collision<n> , the energy deposited in the matter by the ions is converted to mass , momentum , and energy of relativistic electrons and positrons , which are launched from the interaction point . for rhic energies ,<n> the total energy of the system is of the order of 10@xmath1 erg , with a few percent of this energy being converted to relativistic particles , mainly protons and pions . during the early stage of the collision , a few hundred kev proton and pion beams<n> are expected to be produced per second , from which a number of pairs of relativistic jets will be launched . at later times extragalactic jets are thought to form in a variety of astrophysical environments , ranging from galaxy clusters and groups of galaxies , to the intergalactic medium , and possibly even the universe itself .<n> the jets are believed to be launched from the centers of their host galaxies and decelerate to a few kpc , where they interact with the surrounding medium via instabilities and turbulence . here , we report the results of a study of the interaction between jets in nearby galaxies using high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations . we find that , in general , filaments form in jets only far from the source , unless the collision is strong , i.e. , the impact parameter is small . in some cases ,<n> filaments of the form shown in our simulations form in the jets , which is in contrast to filaments often seen in radio images of extra galacticic jets . <n> the study presented here is part of a long - term effort to understand the formation and evolution of jets in the nearby universe . over the last decade<n> , it has become clear that a significant fraction of the energy released in star formation and supernova explosions is channeled into the outflows from the central galaxies @xcite . as a result we present the results of numerical simulations of the collisions of two jets with different jet velocities and impact parameters .<n> the jets are initially prepared in a state of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and their velocities are tuned to be consistent with the experimental data of the 3356 beam of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . for each model jet ,<n> the enstrophy of the colliding jets is calculated as a function of the distance along the jet and the impact parameter at the collision point . <n> the simulations show that the maximum of the ellipticity of the collision is larger for colliding jets with smaller impact parameters and lower jet velocities ( @xmath0 ) . in the simulations , we find a  phase transition '' at a critical point of the impact parameters as a result of the generation of more turbulence in the collision region as compared to the collision of two interacting jets with fixed jet velocities . at the critical point<n> , the maximum ellipticities are larger for interacting jets and lower for collision of non - interacting jets . [<n> fig : test3356projz ] ] the rhic beam of heavy ions at brook the generation of enstrophy in relativistic jets as they plunge through an ambient gas is investigated using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .<n> we find that the dissipation of the jet kinetic energy into turbulence leads to a significant reduction in the enstroph content of the jets , and , as a result , to an enhancement of the turbulent energy density in the jet , compared to that in the quiescent case . in the limit of zero impact parameter ,<n> we show that the enhancement is proportional to the jet velocity , @xmath0 , with a slope that is independent of the impact parameter ( e.g. , * ? ?<n> * , _ et al . _ ) . for jets with a small impact parameter<n> , the enhancement can be as large as a factor of two , depending on the jet characteristics . as jets plunge through a gaseous environment , their bulk kinetic energy dissipates into turbulent energy , which , in turn , results in a significant decrease in the entropy of the flow @xcite . the amount of entropy in jets is , of course , an important aspect of jet physics , since it is closely related to the amount we present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between the jets in the radio galaxy 3c 75 and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .<n> our simulations show that the jet - igm interaction leads to the generation of enstrophy , and , as a consequence , the contribution from stretching dominates the entropy generation . the x - ray source 3c 75 was observed by _ chandra _ in the year 2000 .<n> it is one of the brightest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the northern hemisphere , and is associated with a highly collimated ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 mjy ) jet from the northern branch of the supermassive black hole in the center of ngc 6240 . in this contribution<n> , we present new _ xmm - newton _ observations of this source , as well as new hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction region between the jets and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) . <n> _ introduction : _ the study of jets in agn has a long history , going back to the 1960 s , when zeldovich observed the curvature of the radio jets associated with the black holes in seyfert galaxies @xcite . since then , jets have been discovered in a variety of sources , including low - luminosity quasars ( llabz ) and active galaxies in general , but it is only very recently that their properties have been studied in more detail , especially in we carried out hydrodynamical simulations to study extragalactic jet collisions .<n> we found that colliding jets can be cast into two categories : bouncing and merging jets . we have shown that two fast jets colliding with non - zero impact parameter bounce off each other keeping their identities , but jets with very different velocities colliding with a small impact parameter merge into one jet , and the faster jet takes over the slower jet . in some projections , the filaments may show a twisted structure . this explanation is consistent with all observed features of 3c 75 . we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the merging of two jets in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .<n> the initial conditions are taken from a previous study of the collision of the first jet ( p015v18 ) from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , and the equations of motion for the two colliding nuclei are derived from first principles . the jet - to - jet velocity ratio is found to increase with the impact parameter , reaching a maximum value of @xmath0 at a distance of 15 kpc from the collision point . <n> collisions of relativistic heavy ions at rhic have produced a wide variety of phenomena , including the production of highly collimated jets @xcite , the suppression of jets by thermal bremsstrahlung and the formation of jets from multiple energy depositions in the central engine . in this study<n> , we focus on the problem of jet merging , which has been recently the subject of much theoretical and experimental work . to understand the merging process ,<n> it is important to first determine the conditions under which a collision of two counter - rotating , coplanar jets can form , a process known as merging of the jets the evolution of the transverse momentum ( enstrophy ) in the central region of the lhc collision at @xmath0 = 7 tev is studied by means of hydrodynamical simulations and a phenomenological model .<n> we find that the maximum values of the enstroph at impact parameter p = 0.3 decrease with increasing jet injection velocity , but remain constant at 18000 km s@xmath1 . at the highest jet injection velocities ,<n> the maximum value of the entropy is reached at the shock front , while at lower injection velocities it is reached first at the baroclinic point , and then at the impact point itself . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) at energies above 100 gev offer a unique opportunity to explore the behavior of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the equation of state ( eos ) of the qgp at extreme densities and temperatures . in rhic<n> , the collision of two unequal - energy projectiles ( one proton , one electron , or a quark and an anti - quark ) produces a high - density plasma , known as the hadronic medium ( hjm ) , which is",

covariant quantities in a model system , namely the diffusion process of a polymer in a solution ; this is a paradigmatic problem in statistical mechanics , where we have a large number of models to study , but no theoretical framework to compare them . to this end<n> , we introduce a general class of estimators , the _ varma parameters _ , we introduce a class of stochastic processes , which we call @xmath0 , in which the covariances of the thermodynamical averages are given by the cross - correlations of the stochastic process .<n> we show that this class of processes is equivalent to the varma process , and we derive a theoretical formula for the estimator of the cross covariance in the thermodynamic limit , valid for any value of the process parameters . <n> stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology and finance . in particular , they play a central role in statistical mechanics , where they are used to derive the boltzmann distribution @xcite , the probability distribution of quantities like energies , momenta , etc . for a process to be stochastic it has to satisfy certain conditions , such as the existence of a process covariance , or , more generally , a set of cross -

root of the we introduce a general method for sampling from markov chains of stochastic models ( msms ) .<n> the method is based on the idea of accelerated weighted ensemble ( awe ) simulations , where the markov chain @xmath0 is approximated by a markovian , stochastically driven markov process @xcite . in the awe approach ,<n> the stochastic process is allowed to relax to a stationary distribution , which can then be sampled using a sampling measure . for a large class of models<n> , we show that the sampling is adaptive , that is , the sampling measure is independent of the relaxation step . also , in the adaptive case , a simulation at a given value of sampling can not be easily extended to a larger value ofsampling with the same formula defining the sampling time . <n> markov processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology , and finance . they play an important role in many fields of science and technology , such as dna sequencing , gene regulation , molecular motors , dna - based polymers , as well as in bioinformatics . however , they are also ubiquitous in mathematics and computer science , for example in this paper , we introduce a new sampling method for empirical approximations of markov chains .<n> the method is based on an adaptive allocation of points from the underlying markov chain . in this way ,<n> we obtain approximations that are closer to the empirical distribution than if we use a fixed number of points per bin in the simulations . <n> empirical approximation ( ela ) methods @xcite are widely used to approximate the stationary distribution of a system @xmath0 with respect to a markov process , e.g. , a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , an evolution equation , or a hamiltonian . here<n> we consider ela methods for markov processes on state space , which are also known as  dynamical systems '' or , equivalently , markovian sdes . for a given stationary distribution , the ela method is most often used to compute the stationary expectation value ( sse ) of the transition matrix of the process . however , in many cases , it is not possible to find an ela approximation that is close to the stationary sse of the chain in all of its resamplings . to overcome we present a new algorithm for simulating the time evolution of a quantum state .<n> the algorithm is based on a combination of adaptive and naive sampling , and it does not require any _ a priori _ knowledge of the state or its time evolution . in particular , the algorithm does not need to know the stationary state , nor does it need to be able to predict the value at a future time . <n> we introduce a new sampling scheme for simulating quantum states . here , we first define a target state @xmath0 , which we target with a fixed number of points . for each time step of the algorithm ,<n> we select a subset of the points and update them according to a stationary distribution . at a later time step<n> , these points are resampled using an adaptive algorithm . as a result , error bars for the stationary distribution are significantly smaller than those for the original target state<n> . we also present an algorithm that does not use resampling , but instead relaxes the points to the state space relevant for computing the stationary value of the target state at a given time step . by relaxing the points independently , this algorithm can produce results that are close to the stationary we show how to use a markov chain ( msm ) as a tool to compute time averages of markov chains .<n> in particular , we generalize the hill relation for mean first passage times to the stationary case , and we show that certain dynamical averages of time homogeneous markovchains can be computed from stationary calculations on a related markovian chain . <n> markovian time series are of interest in many areas of physics , including condensed matter and statistical physics @xcite , as well as in computer science and mathematics . in the case of time series ,<n> a widely used approach is the time - averaging method , which is based on the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , followed by an approximation of the solution by a time evolution equation ( tde ) or dynamical system ( dd ) which is then solved by a deterministic time - stepping scheme . here , the system is assumed to be in some equilibrium state , that is , it obeys a markovian master equation ( mme ) @xmath0 , whose solution is obtained by the dd step . for time - dependent problems , such as time averaging , we present a general method for simulating discrete - time hamiltonian systems .<n> the method is based on exact milestoning , and requires only a small amount of simulation time . as an application<n> , we compute the mean first passage time between two points on a discrete lattice . <n> _ introduction._@xmath0 in recent years , much effort has been devoted to understanding and understanding the dynamics of systems described by hamilton s equations of motion @xcite . in this paper ,<n> we focus on the simplest class of such systems : systems in which a particle @xmath1 is driven by a time - dependent force , such as a force exerted by a plate in contact with a heat bath , or a torque acting on a particle in an optical trap . for these systems , it is well known that the dynamics is well described by the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hce ) , which can be solved exactly in the limit of vanishing force . however , even in this simplest case , the hce is not sufficient to describe the main features of the system : for example , there is no exact solution for the motion of an initially localized we consider the dynamics of a quantum particle @xmath0 interacting with a classical field via a nearest -

stationary markov hamiltonians , such as continuous time , stationary , or time homogeneous nmc @ we prove that , when @xmath0 , the free energy of a quantum particle interacting with a noisy electromagnetic field is equal to the sum of the square - root of the intensity of the field .<n> more precisely , we show that if the coupling between the particle and the electromagnetic field exceeds a certain threshold value , then the energy of the particle decreases as the field tends to zero . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain an explicit formula for the probability that the particle does not return to its initial state . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the study of quantum many - body systems is a topic of central importance in modern physics . in particular<n> , one of the most important ways to study a system of interacting particles is to consider its hamiltonian , or , equivalently , its eigenvalue equation @xcite . under the assumption that the interaction between the particles is weak , it is well known that the eigenvalues of the system can be expressed in terms of the wave functions of the particles . on the other hand , under the more general assumption of strong interactions , there is no such an assumption , and it is therefore natural to ask what is the minimum we study the quantum phase transition between a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0 spins to a fermi - dirac condensate ( fdc ) .<n> we consider the ground state of the bec in the presence of an external magnetic field . in the weak field limit<n> , we find that the system is in a mixed phase , characterized by the vanishing of the condensate and the emergence of a bosonic ground state . <n> quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are one of the most fascinating topics in the study of the quantum properties of many - body systems @xcite . during the last decade<n> they have been intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally , see refs.@xcite for a review . as a fundamental property of a quantum system ,<n> the phase transition ( pt ) is defined as the change of the phase of the system from a pure state to a mixed state , where the state is invariant under time evolution . for a spin system<n> the pt is the same as the transition between the ground and excited states of the spin system . on the other hand , for a fermionic system<n> it is different  we present a new algorithm for finding the largest eigenvalue of an eigenfunction of a quantum operator .<n> the algorithm is based on a martingale representation of the eigenvalues , and can be implemented in polynomial time . <n> _ introduction _ the problem of computing eigenstates of quantum operators is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory @xcite . in particular<n> , it plays a central role in the construction of quantum error correction codes , as well as in the calculation of error - correcting codes for error - tolerant quantum computation , e.g. , @xmath0 , where the error is the difference between the input and the output of the quantum system . as such ,<n> the problem is central to the development of quantum algorithms for error correction , which in turn is of central importance in the design of quantum computers . to date , the best algorithms for this task are those based on the solution of a system of algebraic equations . here<n> we present an algorithm for computing the smallest eigen value of an operator , given the state of the system and the value of its eigenstate . in this paper , we prove that for any @xmath0 , the expected number of measurements of a single point on the whole hilbert space is equal to the number of such measurements if and only if the state of the system is completely continuous .<n> we also show that such a result is independent of any prior condition on the state . <n> _ introduction. _ quantum theory is the foundation of our understanding of the physical world . in classical physics ,<n> measurement is a deterministic process , which is a consequence of the laws of nature . on the other hand , in quantum theory , measurements are non - deterministic , and can not be expected to be continuous @xcite . as a result of this<n> , it is natural to ask what is the maximal set of observables that can be measured in a given quantum system , independent of the initial state ?<n> this problem is known as the _ measurement problem_. in quantum mechanics , any observable can be written as the product of two observables : a particle s position and momentum and a wave s velocity . for a particle<n> s momentum , this is the schrdinger equation , @x we derive a closed expression for the probability distribution function of the number of photons emitted by a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms .<n> we show that the distribution can be well approximated by a log - normal function , and we derive the form of this distribution . <n> bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of alkali atoms has been studied for a long time @xcite . in bec<n> , the atoms form a condensate of bosonic quasiparticles , called  photons '' , that couple to the condensate through a dipole - dipole interaction . since the condensate is small compared to the thermal energy of the atoms , it can be considered as a quantum system . as a result ,<n> the bec is a good candidate for quantum information processing , as it provides the entanglement that is needed for quantum communication and computation . however , due to the small number of atoms involved in the process , there is a large uncertainty as to how accurately the quantum state of a bec can be determined . to date , experimental studies of bec in ultracold atomic gases have been limited to measurements of the dipole moment of the condensate , which can be in this paper , we show that the state of an @xmath0-level quantum system interacting with a single - mode electromagnetic field can be mapped onto that of a classical system with the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .<n> we consider the case where the coupling between the system and the field is weak , but the coupling strength is greater than a certain threshold . in this case<n> , the quantum state of the system can not be mapped to that of the classical system . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the study of quantum many - body systems is of interest in a variety of contexts , including quantum metrology , quantum computation , and quantum communication @xcite . for a given quantum system ,<n> an eigenvalue and a eigenfunction of the hilbert space spanned by the states of the quantum system are called _ eigenstates _ , if the state is a separable eigenstate of a non - hermitian hilbert matrix . as such , a hilbert - space representation of a quantum state is called a _ hilbert state_. the state may be mapped into a classical state if and only if its eigenspace is a in this paper , we consider the hamiltonian system @xmath0 , where the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the corresponding eigenvalue problem are given . in particular , in the case of the one - qubit ising model @xcite , when the eig s are real eigenfunctions , and the s - matrix is real and positive definite , it is easy to see that the problem is equivalent to the one of two qubits in one dimension .<n> however , this is not always the case , as we show in the present paper . <n> pacs : 03.67.-a , 03.65.ud , 05.45.mt , 47.52.+j _ introduction : _ one of the most important problems in quantum information theory is the description of the quantum state of a quantum system . for this purpose ,<n> it is of utmost importance to know the symmetries of the wave function of the system , which is the basis of the theory of quantum teleportation , entanglement swapping , quantum error correction , etc .. in this context , the  in this work , we present a solution to the long - standing open problem of finding the transition kernel of an open quantum system .<n> we show that the kernel in question can be written as a linear combination of a @xmath0-parametrized transition kernel and a gaussian transition kernel . using this result ,<n> we are able to solve the problem of computing the transition kernels of open quantum systems . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the seminal work of shannon @xcite , there has been a great deal of interest in the study of quantum systems described by transition kernels ( lhs ) . in this<n> context , it is important to understand when a given lh is a transition kernel for a quantum system described by a hamiltonian , and when it is a lh for a non - perturbative quantum system<n> . one of the open problems that has received the most attention concerns the calculation of transition kernels for open systems , in particular , those described by hamiltonians that are non - hermitian . to this end , many approximations have been proposed , some of which are not even _ a priori _ obvious  we derive a closed - form expression for the entanglement entropy of a quantum state in the presence of a time - dependent gravitational field .<n> we show that the entanglement is bounded from below by the expectation value of an auxiliary state , and that it is bounded again from above by the entanglement of the state with its environment . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics . in the quantum world<n> , the state of a many - body system is described by a wave function @xmath0 , which can be written as a convolution of a wave packet @xcite and a classical probability distribution , known as the _ probability distribution_. in classical mechanics , this distribution is given by the product of two probability distributions , one from the probability distribution of the wave packet and the other from the classical probability of observation . for a particle in an electromagnetic field ,<n> the two distributions are related by the heisenberg uncertainty principle : they are related to each other by the gaussian uncertainty principle ( gup ) . however , in quantum mechanics the wave function is a dynamical variable , so the gup can not be expressed in terms of the probability distributions of the two distribution . we present a method for analytically deriving the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state in the presence of a time - dependent gravitational field .<n> the method is based on the use of a generalization of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) transformation , in which the time - evolution of the state is encoded in a wave function that can be mapped to a classical probability distribution . in the context of bdg theory ,<n> the wave function is the sum of a classical gaussian probability distribution and a quantum probability distribution that is itself a product of classical probability distributions . using this formalism<n> , we derive an exact entanglement spectrum for a non - hermitian quantum state and show that it is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations . <n> entanglement is one of the most important features of quantum mechanics and plays a central role in quantum information processing @xcite . despite its ubiquity , however , there is a number of theoretical and experimental challenges that prevent us from fully understanding the nature of the entanglement that is present in all quantum states . for example , it is well known that quantum states can not be teleported , can not have long - range entanglement , and do not obey local hidden variables @x",

ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) . as a result of these experiments  we study the dynamics of charge , spin , and orbital currents in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the presence of tunnel coupling and coulomb interaction .<n> we find that , due to the interaction , the charge relaxation rate @xmath0 , which is the rate of charge decay in equilibrium , is suppressed , while the spin relaxation rate is enhanced , leading to a non - monotonic behavior of the 2deg current as a function of the tunnel coupling . <n> charge and spin relaxation are among the most important features of spin dynamics ,@xcite which have been studied extensively in the context of mesoscopic systems . in mesmonic systems ,<n> @xcite the decay of charge is due to electron - electron interactions , whereas the spin decay is a result of electron - phonon interactions . for a system of two distinguishable particles , <n> the charge decay rate is proportional to the particle - particle interaction ; for a single distinguishable particle , it is independent of the interaction strength . on the other hand , in systems of many interacting particles<n> , there is no single interaction strength that controls all the relaxation processes . we investigate the relaxation dynamics of an interacting quantum dot in the hund s rule regime , where the dot is weakly coupled to a metallic substrate .<n> the decay of the charge , spin , and occupation probabilities is studied as a function of the dot - substrate coupling strength and the temperature . at low temperatures ,<n> the charge relaxation is found to be strongly energy - dependent , whereas the spin relaxation rate is energy independent . <n> quantum mechanical many - body systems are characterized by the non - equilibrium relaxation of the occupation probabilities . in equilibrium , these probabilities are given in terms of the ground - state energy and the occupation probability in the odd ( even ) sector is symmetrically shifted from the even sector by a symmetric deviation of the system from the equilibrium state @xcite . however , in the presence of an external perturbation , a system being brought out of equilibrium should perform specific deviations from this state in order to obtain a specific relaxation rate . for a system in thermal equilibrium<n> , this relaxation rate depends only on the energy , the level position in the interacting system , as well as on the symmetry of the deviation . on the other hand , for non - interacting systems , relaxation we investigate the relaxation of charge and spin on a single - electron quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime .<n> we find that the charge relaxation is sensitive to the presence of two particles in the system , while the spin relaxation is not . in both cases ,<n> the relaxation rate is found to be a function of the dot level position . <n> quantum dots ( qds ) are promising candidates for quantum information processing @xcite due to their high coherence times and low power dissipations . among the different physical properties that can be achieved with them , the coherence time @xmath0 of a qd is of particular interest , since it is determined by the strength of the electron - electron interaction , which is the main source of decoherence for a solid - state device . as a consequence , in the absence of external magnetic field , qd s coherence times can be much longer than the thermal relaxation time of a single electron . however , when a magnetic field is applied the coherence times of qd can be drastically reduced , and it is expected that a strong electron - magnetic interaction can be present , leading to the so - called zeeman effect , @x we study the time evolution of spin and charge in the anderson model of a single - electron quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field .<n> we find that the time - resolved spin variance , @xmath0  2rangle(t)$ ] , shows a sign change from electron - like to hole - like as a function of the electron - hole occupation of the quantum dot , and then follows a gaussian decay with time . in the limit of large magnetic field<n> , the spin variance exhibits a power - law behavior , with an exponent close to unity . <n> pacs numbers : 73.20.dx , 73.40.gk , 71.70.ej , 72.15.rn _ introduction._quantum dots ( qds ) in semiconductor heterostructures are promising building blocks for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite , due to their long coherence times , high stability against disorder and small size , compared to solid - state devices , which are limited by the low mobility of the electrons . the spin degree of freedom of a quantum dot ( q dot ) can be used to control the spin we propose a quantum point contact ( qpc ) as a tool for measuring single - particle relaxation rates in semiconductor quantum dots .<n> we show that a measurement with a nearby qpc allows one to extract a single decay rate from the occupation of a single state , in contrast to measurements with conventional qpcs , for which a single relaxation rate is required to be measured in order to obtain the full occupation probability vector . <n> the relaxation of the occupation probability in a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) is governed by the electron - electron interaction in the dot , which can be controlled by means of a gate voltage @xcite . in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , screening of the interaction by the 2deg results in an effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 , while in a single - electron gas , the interaction leads to an effective zeeman splitting of the electron states . for a 2deg in a magnetic field ,<n> the electron interaction is screened by the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the field line passing through the dot @x<n> . therefore , a gate - controlled decay of the dot occupation probability can be obtained by tuning the we investigate the effect of rate fluctuations on the relaxation dynamics of the probabilities in a quantum dot .<n> we find that a finite variation of the energy level and the interaction can lead to a relaxation governed _ only _ by the rate , that is , by the strength of the interaction . on the other hand , a variation in the interaction strength<n> is accompanied by an opposite variation in this rate . as a result ,<n> a crossover between the two regimes appears around the symmetry point of the anderson model . <n> _ introduction._quantum dots ( qds ) play an important role in many areas of physics @xcite . in particular , in the field of solid state physics , they are widely used as qubits , i.e. , quantum bits ( qbs ) , which are the building blocks of quantum computers . however , the experimental realization of qbs in solid state devices is still in its infancy , and it is not clear how they can be treated in a controlled environment . to this end<n> , it is important to understand the mechanisms which lead to the relaxation of the occupation probabilities of the qd . for this purpose  we show how to use a quantum point contact ( qpc ) to measure the time evolution of the occupation probability in a two - level system with strong on - site coulomb repulsion .<n> we consider a single - level quantum dot ( qd ) , which can be prepared by a time - resolved measurement of the current in a qpc located nearby the system . by varying the gate voltage<n> , the qpc can be used to determine the relaxation rate of the system and , thus , to probe the dynamics of the interaction between the qd and the environment . <n> quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) are devices that allow one to investigate the time - evolution of a quantum system @xcite . in particular , they can be employed to read out the time dependence of observables that are sensitive to only one occupation probability , for instance the probability of the quantum dot being empty . here , we show that by modulating the voltage of a gate acting on a single quantum dot , it is possible to read - out its time evolution in a way that is similar to the one that can be achieved by time - dependent measurements in atomic systems . for a system consisting of two quantum dots we study the electron relaxation in a quantum point contact ( qpc ) formed by a tunnel - coupled two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .<n> the relaxation rates for charge and spin are calculated as a function of the tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 and the level position in the 2deg in the absence of an external magnetic field . in particular , we show that the relaxation rate in the qpc is determined by the slope of the time evolution of the current - voltage characteristic . <n> pacs numbers : 74.50.+r , 73.23.ad , 85.75.-d 2 the electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems is of central interest in modern condensed matter physics.@xcite the electron spin plays a crucial role in determining the transport properties , as it is the only degree of freedom which is not affected by the presence of a magnetic field or disorder . as a result ,<n> the spin - orbit interaction is the main source of decoherence in memoscopic systems ; however , it is not the only effect of the spin : other effects , such as the coulomb interaction , also play an important role , and have been investigated in we calculate the charge and spin relaxation rates of a quantum dot ( qd ) in the coulomb blockade regime .<n> we find that the relaxation rates are dominated by cotunneling effects , which are manifest in terms of coherent transitions changing the particle number on the dot . on one hand ,<n> the charge relaxation rate @xmath0 is dominated by renormalization of the tunnel coupling , on the other hand the spin relaxation rate is due to the deviation of the state of the qd from equilibrium . <n> [ [ introduction.- ] ] introduction .-<n> + + + - + ++ + + the study of quantum transport in semiconductor nanostructures has led to the discovery of majorana fermions @xcite . in these systems<n> the electrons form a one - dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) , while the holes are in the two - dimensional ( 2deg)-type . due to their low energy level spacing<n> the 1degs are well isolated from the other 2degs , making it possible to confine the electrons to a single quantum dot and to observe their transport properties . for the realization of quantum information processing , however , it is of interest to we study the charge response of a quantum dot coupled to a scattering region which is weakly coupled to either a normal conducting or a superconducting lead .<n> we calculate the relaxation rates of the charge in the presence of both coulomb interaction and induced charge - spin correlations in the scattering region . using a renormalization - group approach ,<n> we show that these rates are not renormalized at all by second order tunneling processes , and that virtual @xmath0-renormalization processes cancel each other . in the case of a noninteracting scattering region coupled to both normal and superconducting leads , we find that the charge relaxation rate is strongly influenced by induced correlations . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the discovery of quantum dots @xcite , a large amount of work has been devoted to the theoretical and experimental study of these systems . the interest to these systems is twofold : first of all , they are of interest for the fundamental understanding of mesoscopic transport and , second , because of their potential applications in the field of quantum information processing , e.g. , as a quantum memory . to date , most of the theoretical studies have been restricted to a single - level quantum we study the transport properties of a quantum dot ( qd ) weakly coupled to a superconductor .<n> we consider a setup in which the qd is not coupled only to a normal lead , but also to an _ additional _ superconducting contact induced by the proximity effect . in the limit of a large superconducting gap @xmath0 , we find that the relaxation of the charge in the dot is strongly influenced by the mixing of the empty and doubly occupied states of the dot , which enters in the time evolution of quantities sensitive to two - particle effects , such as the charge relaxation rate . <n> transport in mesoscopic systems has been the subject of intense interest during the last years.@xcite one of the main motivations for this research is the possibility to realize majorana fermions in quantum dots , since the strong coulomb interaction in these systems gives rise to a number of interesting phenomena , including the fractional quantum hall effect , and the kondo effect @xcite . a promising candidate for the realization of a majorana state in a dot<n> is the hund s insulator , where the superconductor is kept at the same chemical potential as the normal lead and the electrons in the we study the relaxation dynamics of a quantized charge on a quantum dot formed in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) coupled to superconducting leads .<n> we find that , despite the presence of an additional superconducting lead , the charge still decays with a single relaxation rate , which is determined by the occupation probabilities of the singly occupied states on the dot . as a consequence ,<n> the quantum dot can serve as a quantum memory . <n> the study of relaxation and decoherence processes in mesoscopic systems is at the heart of quantum information science @xcite . in particular<n> , it has been shown that quantum information can be efficiently stored and manipulated in a system of many interacting quantum bits ( qubits ) , e.g. in the form of quantum memories , or in a quantum computer . to date , most of the theoretical work has been focused on systems of a single electron gas in contact with a reservoir , i.e. on systems in which the electrons are confined to a single quantum dot ( qd ) or a single - electron transistor ( set ) and the electrons interact with each other via the coulomb repulsion . however , we study the quantum dynamics of electrons in a proximity - coupled quantum dot , which is attached to a superconducting lead and embedded in a normal or a ferromagnetic environment .<n> we show that the presence of the ferromagnetic contact breaks the spin symmetry of the quantum dot and leads to the appearance of a mixing of the charge and spin degrees of freedom . in the normal case , this results in a relaxation rate which depends on the level position and on the interaction strength , but is independent of the presence or absence of the superconducting contact . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + /- introduction- + + [ + / - introduction- ] recent experiments on semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite have demonstrated the feasibility of using the electron spin as a resource for quantum information processing , see fig . [ fig_scheme ] ( c ) for a review of these experiments . the interest in the use of electron spin for this purpose is twofold : first of all , the possibility to use the spin degree of freedom of the electron as a source of information is of fundamental interest , since the spin of a single electron can be used as a proxy for its spin state we study the decay of @xmath0ni@xmath1o in the framework of the isospin - dependent quantum monte carlo method .<n> we show that the decay is characterized by a quantum phase transition from a normal state to a non - fermi liquid state , and that this transition is accompanied by a change of the sign of the decay constant . <n> the decay rate of a heavy fermion into an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state is one of the most important observables in heavy - ion collision experiments . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of this decay process @xcite , due to the fact that this decay channel has been predicted to play a crucial role in the understanding of the mechanism of high - energy collisions , as well as in the search for exotic states of matter such as superconductors , superfluids and mott insulators . however , up to now , no experimental results have been reported , even though the decay has been measured in a number of experiments @x<n> 1 . it has been suggested that the observed decay rate is consistent with the hypothesis that the system undergoes a fermi - liquid we study the coupled evolution of charge and spin in a quantum dot with coulomb interaction and tunnel coupled to a ferromagnetic contact .<n> we find different time scales in the evolution of the reduced density matrix of a single - level qd , after being brought out of equilibrium , which are related to the presence of two particles in the dot and to processes involving two - particles . in the hybrid as well as in the normal system , we find an additional rate @xmath0 , that is independent of the energy level of the dot , the interaction strength and the tunnel coupling . <n> quantum dots ( qds ) can be used as building blocks for new solid - state devices , such as quantum memories @xcite , quantum information processors @x , or quantum simulators @x<n> . however , in order to fully exploit the potential offered by these systems , it is necessary to understand their coupled dynamics . to this aim<n> , one has to consider the time - evolution of a small qd in contact with a reservoir , either in equilibrium or out - of - equilibrium . here<n> we investigate the coupled dynamics of a charge and a spin , both initially localized in the we report on the observation of a new type of quantum tunneling phenomenon , in which the tunneling rate @xmath0 of a quantum dot ( qd ) can be directly extracted from time - resolved measurements of the current through a nearby quantum point contact .<n> this is possible due to the non - hermitian nature of the tunneling matrix in the qd eigenbasis . in the case of normal - superconductor systems ,<n> we show that the rate can be extracted from the time - dependent response of the system to specific variations of the interaction strength and the level position . <n> quantum tunneling is one of the most fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in recent years . for a single particle in a stationary state<n> this phenomenon is well understood in terms of quantized hall conductance , which is quantized in units of the strength of the coupling between the particle and the system , such as in the tunneling of a cooper pair between a superconductor and a normal metal , or of a charge in a normal conductor and a superconducting lead . as a consequence<n> , quantum tunneling has been studied theoretically in various setups , including the case in which a qd we study the nonequilibrium steady state of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of an external magnetic field .<n> the bec is modelled by a set of coupled 1d harmonic oscillators , which are coupled to each other through a nearest - neighbor exchange interaction of strength @xmath0 . using a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach ,<n> we calculate the stationary density matrix and the eigenvalues of the corresponding eigenvalue problem . in particular , we find that the spin and charge eigenstates of the 1d bec are identical to those of a spinless fermion system , whereas the spin eigenstate is different from the spin state of the bosonic bec in that it has a non - vanishing expectation value . <n> pacs numbers : : 03.65.vf , 03.67.mn , 05.30.fk , 75.10.pq quantum many - body systems have been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and experimental research in recent years , both to study fundamental properties as well as to perform practical applications @xcite . we present a method to compute all observables of a quantum dot , including spin and charge , using a reduced density matrix .<n> the method is based on a vector representation for the density matrix of the quantum dot and yields a closed form expression for the expectation value of any quantum dot observable . as an example , we calculate the spin on the dot and the charge on it , as well as the spin -

nucleon effective interaction has been one of the central issues in the study of nuclear structure since the time of the thomas - fermi theory @xcite . since then , it has been an important tool in the investigation of the structure properties of nuclear matter , in particular , of the neutron - rich medium and heavy - ion systems @x we study the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory ( rmf ) .<n> the calculation is performed for @xmath0o and @xcite . in the rmf calculation<n> the nucleons are treated as nucleons lying in the bound states , and the effective interaction between them is determined by the correlation operator determined in the first -

einstein condensate of @xmath1 rydberg atoms in an external magnetic field . using a two - step method ,<n> we have calculated the one - body and two - body properties of the condensate .<n> we find that the condensate is a spin - polarized fermi liquid , though the single - particle energy is not exactly proportional to the magnetization of the system . <n> _ introduction. _<n> spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in quantum many - body systems has been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years @xcite . in so systems<n> , the total angular momentum of a single particle is not a conserved quantity , and the total spin of a system can be zero or non - zero depending on the sign of the so - called zeeman energy , which is the ratio of the interparticle distance to the particle - particle distance . as a result , in a system with so many particles , it is not always possible to find an effective hamiltonian that reproduces the exact solution of the two - particle schrdinger equation . to overcome this difficulty , we study the structure of @xmath0o , which is considered as a possible candidate for a nucleus - nucleus bound state .<n> we calculate the binding energy and the width of the bound state using effective nucleon - nucleon potentials and compare it with the experimental value . <n> a nucleus bound by a bound state is called a _ nucleus _ if its binding energy is larger than its decay energy @xcite . in nuclear physics ,<n> the study of bound states is important not only for the fundamental understanding of nuclear structure , but also for practical applications , such as precision spectroscopy , nuclear magnetic resonance , and accelerator studies of heavy - ion collisions . for a given nucleus , a bound<n> state is a nuclear bound state whose energy , width and decay width are smaller than those of a free state , due to the fact that the nuclear wave function is different from that of the free state and the state is located in a different part of the nuclear chart . as a result<n> , the properties of a nucleus can be determined from its bound state by measuring the decay width and binding energy of the _<n> nucleus_. in particular , it is possible to determine the width and we study the ground - state properties of @xmath0o@xmath1 by means of a two - step method , in which the pauli - blocking effect is taken into account in the calculation of the potential energy of the ground state , and the effective interactions are obtained by the exact diagonalization method .<n> we find that the j - j and j - k channels are very different dependingly on the treatment of the blocking effect employed . in the 0@ xmath1 state<n> , it is shown that the potential of the first - order potential energy in the zero - angular - momentum state is dominated by the contribution of the j channel , while that of the partial - wave channel is brought about in the j potential due to the large blocking effect . <n> pacs number(s ) : 21.10.dr , 21.30.fe , 21.60.jz , 27.70.+q , 25.80.nv , 36.10.pj , 05.45.+b , 12.20.ds in recent years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of the properties of atomic @xcite and molecular @x , @ we study the properties of the nucleon - singlet ( nsc ) state in @xmath0he , which is a bound state of two nucleons , in the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft ) .<n> we find that the nsc potential has a strong pauli - blocking effect in the channels with small angular momenta , and that the potential energy ( pe ) of the bound state ( ke ) in the 0@xmath1 states is almost the same as that of the free nucleon ( j ) plus pe in spite of having different partial - wave contributions . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.nk , 03.75.hh , 21.30.+y 2 recently , it has been realized that the bound states ( kes ) can appear in a variety of condensed matter systems , such as high - temperature superconductors @xcite , neutron stars with extraordinary properties @x<n> . however , the nature of these states is still an open question . in this letter<n> , we will discuss the single - particle properties of kes in nucleon superconductor ( nhc ) and nsc in we have presented a formulation of the ultra - molecular orbital approach ( umoa ) to apply it to a structure calculation of hypernuclei .<n> the umoa has been applied to the calculation of the structure of @xmath0o , in which we have calculated the single - particle energies of the states 0@xmath1 , 0@ x and 0@ y , as well as the spin - orbit splittings of the ground states . the problem of the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction has been solved by solving the three - body problem @xcite . with the calculated effective interaction ,<n> we have also calculated the energy difference between the 0@math1 and the 2@ x states , and the energy differences between the states with the same quantum numbers , namely , the 0x@xcite and 0xmath2 states ; and , we have studied the role of many - body correlations , such as the core polarization , on these energy differences . <n> = 10000 nuclear structure and structure calculations play an important role in nuclear physics , especially in the study of neutron - rich nuclei . in nuclear structure calculations<n> , it is of great importance to take into account we have calculated the spin - orbit splitting of the single - particle levels of @xmath0o in the 0@xmath1 state , using the nijmegen and jlich nucleon - nucleon potential codes . in the calculation ,<n> we have introduced a new treatment for the pauli - blocking effect , in which , while we exclude the interactions acting among forbidden states as in the usual treatment , we restore the interactions that are diagonal in occupied nucleon states .<n> the results have shown that the spin orbit splitting is unbound for the j , jb and nsc potentials and , on the other hand , bound for the jb potential . <n> the calculations have been carried out in the ultra - molecular orbital method ( umoa ) , and some problems that still remain in the application of the umoa have been addressed . the band and yamamoto model for the @xmath0 states is extended to include the spin - orbit interaction .<n> it is shown that the band model reproduces well the properties of the ground state and the low - lying excited states . <n> it has been a long - standing problem how to describe the low energy properties of nuclear matter in the framework of the non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( nrqm ) @xcite . in this letter<n> , we will show that , in addition to the band - model , the miyagawa - glckle - stoks ( mgls ) model @xxcite which is a relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach , and the gibson - hungerford ( gw ) method @x , which is an alternative to the rmf method , can provide a consistent description of low - energy properties in the nuclear mass region . as an example , for the nucleon -

nucleon ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interaction in the framework of the effective field theory ( eft ) , using the folded - diagram method .<n> the method is applied to the calculation of the binding energies of the ground states of light nuclei , and the results are compared with those of the band theory . <n> the effective interaction ( efi ) is one of the most important concepts in the theory of nuclear structure @xcite . in this theory ,<n> the interaction is decomposed into two parts , the nucleon part and the antinucleon part , which are described by the single - particle and the double - particle potentials , respectively . for a given nuclear system , perturbative calculations of the efi can be carried out only for the single particle potential , while for the double potential it is possible to perform calculations for both potentials simultaneously . however , in the case of the interaction between two nucleons , eft is not applicable . to overcome this difficulty<n> , one can extend eft by folding the diagrammatic theory into a diagrammatic formalism , known as the folded diagram method (  we study the ground state properties of the @xmath0 nucleus @xcite by using the brandow - shavitt - redmon ( ssr ) effective interaction in the framework of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .<n> the effective interaction is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for a particle in a random potential . to solve the schdinger equation ,<n> we use the holinde - speth - de tourreil ( hhd ) method , which is a variant of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ( hfb ) in which the hamiltonian is expanded in a set of harmonic oscillator basis states . <n> the hbt method has been applied to the calculation of ground state energies of nuclei by brandow and shavitt and redmon@xcite . in this approach , the nucleon is treated as a massless particle and the interaction between the nucleons<n> is assumed to be given by the coulomb potential of the type of brandow s . since the holzenkamp , maessen , rijken and de swart ( hrd ) treatment of the deuteron @x we present a calculation of the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 in p+p collisions at the cern sps .<n> the effect of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) at high energy is studied by using a model in which the gluon density in the cgc is assumed to be proportional to the mean free path of the gluons in the medium . <n> the study of nuclear effects in high energy heavy ion collisions has a long history . during the 1970 s<n> , it was realized that high energy collisions of heavy nuclei at sps and rhic energies would lead to a change in the eos of nuclear matter @xcite . in this letter , we present the results of a calculation for the nuclear modifications factor @ xmath0 for p + p collisions at cern - sps energies in the framework of a model which takes into account the color - glass - condensate ( ggc)@xcite and isospin - dependent gluon densities . the calculation is based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , which has been shown to provide an excellent description of the properties of the matter created at rhic and sp",

to - helix transition ( cst we present a theoretical study of the folding and stretching properties of a single polymer consisting of two mutually interacting springs .<n> we show that the average length of the protein - spring increases linearly with the stretching rate , provided that the monomer - monomer interactions are short - ranged , so that the polymer is not stretched too strongly . in the limit of large stretching rates , however , the average polymer length diverges , signaling the folding of the polymer . <n> the properties of proteins are of central importance to the functioning of living cells @xcite . for example , proteins such as dna and rna are the fundamental building blocks of cells , yet they are very fragile when subjected to external forces , such as a heat - bath or a pulling force . as a result ,<n> understanding the mechanical response of proteins is an important issue , which has received considerable attention in the last few years ( for a recent review , see , for instance , http://link.aps.org/doi/abs/10.1103/physrevlett.110.245401[110 ] ) . a major step towards a unified description of proteins<n> is the concept of a folding - folding we study the mechanical unfolding of a three - domain protein by means of extensive monte carlo simulations .<n> we first analyze the entropic effects related to temperature through the analysis of computations in the absence of a folding prize , and then investigate the role of long - range interaction by setting a non - zero prize on a single - domain polymer . in the last part , we discuss the relation between pulling rate and unfolding force , finding a logarithmic law , valid in the limit of high pulling rate . [ cols=\",,options=\"header \" , ] we show that the computation of the free energy of an unfolding event in a two - dimensional ising model is strongly influenced by the entropic contribution to the folding free energy .<n> in particular , the temperature @xmath0 at the peak of the unfolding profile plays a crucial role in determining the folding mechanism . <n> pacs numbers : 87.10.+e , 05.70.fh , 64.60.cn , 68.35.rh 2 the folding of microscopic conformations in two dimensions ( 2d ) is an important problem in statistical mechanics @xcite . in 2d<n> , a folding event is associated with the unfolding of a domain of a given size and shape , which is the outcome of a process in which the number of microscopic configurations allowed in a moment preceding the unfolding event is set by the folding prize . for a free energy computation ,<n> the role of the enthalpic term and of the harmonic constant is related to the _ folding _<n> prize , and the folding threshold plays a similar role . by contrast , if the computation is performed in an entropic space , then the role _ of _ the entropy , i.e we study the dynamics of a simple model of self - assembly consisting of a spring interacting with an external field , in the limit of zero temperature .<n> we show that the transition from the folded to the unfolded state is strongly influenced by the mutual influence of the unfolding events resulting from the action of the spring . as a consequence ,<n> the free energy landscape near the transition is strongly modified . <n> the folding transition of an isolated , self - assembled system is one of the most important transitions in living cells @xcite . in spite of the simplicity of the model , which consists of a collection of interacting springs , the transition can be very different depending on the temperature @xmath0 and on the number of degrees of freedom of the system : for low temperatures the system is in a stretched state , for high temperatures it is in an unfolded state and vice versa . on the other hand , as the temperature is increased , or as the strength of the external field is decreased , there is a competition between the two transitions : in the low temperature limit the unfolding transition is suppressed and the transition to the folded state is rapid , while in the high temperature limit , it is rapid and continuous @x we show that the unfolding transition of a domain of a polymer chain is strongly influenced by the free energy landscape explored by the system during the transition .<n> we find that the number of accessible conformations increases with the order of the unfolding event thus suggesting that the breakdown of the domain actually favours further unfolding events . in the case of a first - order phase transition ,<n> the unfolding properties of the system strongly depend on the value of the elastic force . for low values of the force<n> , the system develops a stretched state whose free energy is lower than that of the unfolded state , thus forbidding the breakdown . on the other hand , for high values , with each unfolding event , new conformations become free thus increasing the fluctuations of the polymer and spring length . <n> the stretching transition of an isolated polymer chain ( or domain ) @xcite is a typical example of a phase transition between two different conformations of the chain : a domain and a folded state . at first sight , such a transition might seem to be impossible , since the elastic energy of the folded state is much lower than the one of the domains . however , in recent experiments it has been shown that this is not the we present a detailed analysis of the force - temperature phase diagram of a simple model for protein folding .<n> the folding mechanism of the protein is shown to depend strongly on the temperature , the force and the entropy . in the high temperature limit ,<n> the force threshold for unfolding is found to be independent of these parameters . at low temperatures<n> , unfolding is strongly influenced by the fluctuations . <n> protein folding is one of the most fundamental processes in living cells @xcite . during the folding of the first domain of a protein , a folding prize<n> is shared by several domains , each of which has a different length @xmath0 ( panel ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) shows the largest peak in the plot of the folding distances , while the length of the second peak is the smallest one . as a consequence , _ unfolding _ , that is the folding process in which the last domain is collapsed , is the dominant one in proteins at high and low temperatures , respectively . for a model of a single domain protein ( sc )<n> . the folding distance between the first and second peak of the plot ( panels ( a and b  we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the force - extension profiles of proteins composed of identical domains .<n> we show that thermal fluctuations are able to overcome energy barriers and the protein is pulled at a finite velocity , which leads to a non - equilibrium stretching process . upon unfolding , the protein domains , upon stretching the polymer , are coupled due to the identical energetic features of the domains and the height of the peaks of the @xmath0 plot only depends on the energetic term . as a consequence , at low temperatures , thermal fluctuations<n> are allowed enough time to overcome the energy barrier and the pulling force will be low . <n> proteins are composed by a large number of domains that interact with each other through the exchange of energy . in order to understand the function of proteins at the cellular scale ,<n> it is essential to study the dynamics of protein - protein interactions , _<n> i.e. _ when a protein is _ pulled _ at a constant velocity by another protein at a different temperature . to this purpose , in this work , we consider a simple model , namely a simple protein composed by identical domains ( _ e.g. : _ dna  we study the effect of an external force on the thermal fluctuations of a two - state model at finite temperature .<n> we show that , as the number of monte - carlo steps @xmath0 is increased , the system undergoes a transition from a canonical to a non - canonical thermal state . in the canonical phase ,<n> the equilibrium temperature is independent of the pulling rate , whereas in the non - classical phase _<n> i.e. _ , at finite pulling speeds , it depends on the rate at which the energy is released from the barrier separating the two states . <n> the study of thermal fluctuations in systems far from equilibrium is of fundamental importance in physics @xcite and plays an important role in many fields of physics , such as condensed matter physics @ xcite , nuclear astrophysics @x<n> . it also has applications in the field of biophysics , where it is crucial to understand the mechanisms leading to the formation of matter - antimatter separation in the earth s atmosphere and in the formation and evolution of life in various environments , including bacteria , viruses and bacteria . the thermal equilibrium properties of a large class of molecules and polymers are well described by kramer s theory we perform monte - carlo simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of a single polymer chain pulled through a potential barrier .<n> we show that , in the limit of an extremely high pulling speed , the polymer can adopt just a single ( or at most , a few ) conformation , so that the entropic contribution can be neglected in the computations . as a consequence ,<n> the mean rupture forces computed from the histograms of the rupture spring elongations feature an excellent linear correlation with the logarithm of the loading rate . in this limit<n> , we also find that the number of steps @xmath0 in the monte carlo simulation is a measure of the pulling speed and we interpret this dependence as the signature of the folding prize . <n> the folding of macromolecules is a fundamental process in biology and chemistry , that is central to the function of living cells @xcite and to the functioning of molecular machines , such as molecular motors , sensors , and generators of chemical reactions , as well as to the dynamics of individual molecules . despite the vast effort that has been invested in understanding the mechanics of folding , it is not yet clear how the microscopic mechanism that governs the folding process is related we study the mechanical unfolding of a domain of a macromolecular spring .<n> we show that the folding prize , which determines the extension of the domain , is destroyed when a number of contacts just below the pulling threshold are cleaved in the polymer . on the other hand ,<n> the length of the folded domain is preserved if more contacts are disrupted . by computing the energy difference between the two states , we identify the factors affecting the unfolding probability . in particular , the stiffness of the cantilever , temperature and the pulling velocity are found to be the key factors . <n> the folding of protein domains is an example of a process in which a large number of steps play a crucial role @xcite . at low temperatures , such as in the vicinity of the protein folding threshold , a protein domain can be unfolded by mechanical forces , e.g. , through the action of an external force @xmath0 , provided the external force exceeds a certain threshold . for proteins of a large class , including those that are known to fold spontaneously , this process is a non - trivial one : a folding prize is lost , followed by a subsequent relaxation of the spring , leading to a we have developed an extremely simplified model of polymer stretching in which the molecule is portrayed as a series of modules , represented as an array of contacts , and a harmonic spring ( the cantilever ) . the chemical interactions stabilizing the native conformation are simply modeled as a folding prize gained by domains where the fraction of folded monomers is above a pre - chosen threshold . our approach is consistent with recent findings , showing that the unraveling of the titin immunoglobulin domain occurs very rapidly only after the breakdown of a critical number of key hydrogen - bonds . however , our model is significantly simpler than other models commonly used to study mechanical unfolding such as the wlc and fjc models and the detailed all - atom , topological and united - residue models employed for steered molecular dynamics simulations .<n> we have applied our model to reproduce many qualitative features of the force - extension profiles recorded in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiments , in particular the saw - tooth pattern with peaks characterized by a height dependent on the folding prize , the temperature and the pulling velocity . in our study , a particular attention was paid to the relation between the heights of successive peaks in the unfolding event , suggesting that the protein domains unfold following an increasing order of mechanical we present a simple toy - model for atomic force microscopy ( afm ) stretching , based on a minimal energy model that includes harmonic and long - range energy contributions .<n> our results appear to be in agreement with recent findings by cieplak @xcite in steered molecular dynamics simulations of titin and calmodulin unfolding using a go - like model . in particular , it was found that an increase in thermal fluctuations results in a lowering of the force peaks and in their earlier occurrence during stretching . <n> an interesting feature of afm stretching experiments is that the mean unfolding force is a logarithmic function of the pulling rate . this pattern reflects the role of thermal fluctuations : if the pulling speed is sufficiently low , then there will be enough time for thermal fluctuations to drive the polymer over the free energy barrier and the unfolding force will be accordingly low . the ability to reproduce this pattern constitutes a benchmark for any stretching model<n> . we also test our model using monte carlo simulations and find that it is not only capable of reproducing the force - extension saw - tooth pattern , but it also yields force spectra displaying the correct logarithmic dependence of @xmath0 , as reported in experimental works . * _ keywords  we use coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the transition state ensemble ( tse ) and  en - route '' intermediates for protein folding .<n> we find that topological factors play an important role in determining the detailed structure of the transition states and the intermediates , and that the energetic balance between binding energy and entropy plays a crucial role in the formation of these features . <n> [ [ section ] ] the mechanism of protein folding is one of the most important aspects of biopolymerization . in order to understand the folding mechanism of proteins ,<n> it is important to understand how the topology of the protein building blocks affects its ability to fold . to this end<n> , topological factors have been studied extensively in the context of protein structure @xcite . however , it is not clear what topological factors are responsible for the specific features of the folding process and how they can be used to improve our understanding of this important process . here , we focus on the topological factors that control the ability of proteins to fold into globular clusters , which are the most abundant form of life on the earth . despite their importance , very little<n> is known about the mechanisms by which topological factors affect the folding",

free massive gravity in the decoupling limit and study the cosmology of this theory .<n> we then covariantize this theory and study some of its features for cosmology . <n> massive gravity has recently been proposed as a possible candidate for a theory of gravity beyond the standard model , @xcite . in this theory<n> , the graviton of mass @xmath0 can be described by a supersymmetric extension of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , where the effective action is constructed in terms of the tadpole and the metric , and where the coupling constants are fixed at the planck scale . while this theory is completely covariant , studying the cosmology as well as other non - trivial curved geometries can be extremely complicated . here ,<n> we here review the covariant version of massive gravity that is directly derived from the limit in which the strong coupling scale is kept fixed and the helicity-0 contribution is split into helicity-1 and -0 contributions , which decouples from each other . as a result , ghost - like pathologies in massive gravity theory disappear to all orders , at least up to quartic order beyond the decoupling in this letter we propose a simple ghost - free extension of the standard cosmological model .<n> we show that in this model there is no cosmological constant , no matter how fine - tuned , there is always an interaction between the metric and the stress energy tensor . instead of studying the cosmology in the exact non - linear covariantized theory which can be extremely hard , we use the alternative approach of covariantizing the lagrangian in the decoupling limit , and use the resulting theory as a proxy . <n> cosmology is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical physics . in order to solve this problem ,<n> we need to come up with a new approach which is not based on perturbation theory , but rather on renormalization group ( rg ) theory @xcite . by renormalizing the rg parameter @xmath0 , _<n> e.g. _ , by including the effects of gravity @cite , one obtains a theory which is linear in the hamiltonian , with the coefficients of the theory playing the role of free parameters . as a result , the theory is exactly linearized in the coupling constant . on the other hand , in order in this letter we show that the covjor - horndeski lagrangian @xmath0 , and the structure of the dual riemann tensor @xcite , are directly related to massive gravity . as a consequence ,<n> the propagation of gravitational constraints is guaranteed to take place in a background where we are not in the einstein frame .<n> furthermore , the fact that the stress - energy tensor has at most two time - derivatives guarantees that constraints enter at most with two derivatives . <n> massive gravity has been proposed as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of particle physics . in its simplest form , massive gravity<n> is described by a scalar - tensor theory of gravity coupled to gravity through a cubic term in the action . at the classical level , this theory has two free parameters : the mass of the scalar field and the scale of the gravitational interaction . for a free - massless scalar field<n> , there is a one - parameter family of lagrangians , called covjons , which have a single free parameter . with the addition of the second parameter , a scalar field can be described in terms of two interacting scalar fields , one of which is massive  in this paper , we study the resulting cosmology in a recently proposed class of self - accelerating solutions of einstein - hilbert gravity .<n> we focus on the cosmology of the covariantized theory on a frw background with scale factor and hubble parameter , and study the self - acceleration solution , as well as the late - time acceleration . <n> einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) @xcite is one of the most important developments in modern physics . in its simplest form<n> , it describes the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time filled with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) , which acts as a gravitational constant in the exterior of the frw vacuum . at the same time , einstein introduced a class of general relativity theories in which the gravitational constant is not a constant but an explicit function of time . among these , there is a class that is based on the theory of _ partial differential equations _ ( pde ) ( [ eq : pij ] ) in which both the einstein and the riemann dual tensors are transverse . we present a covariantized version of the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) theory in which the frw field equations are replaced by a set of non - linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , the so - called proxy theory .<n> we show that our theory exhibits a self - accelerated solution , with the hubble parameter set by the graviton mass . for the stability condition of this self - accelerating solution<n> , we derive two constraints , one coming from the parameter space derived in @xcite and the other from the condition for perturbations on the background solution . <n> pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 11.27.+d , 04.50.+h + the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , as we know it , is the most studied model in particle physics today . in its simplest form ,<n> the sm consists of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time with a cosmological constant , which is coupled to gravity through the fermion fields of the scalar field , @xmath0 , and to matter through the dilaton , s , p , r , we present a new class of self - accelerating background solutions which exhibit degravitation .<n> these solutions are obtained by adding spatial curvature to the scalar field equations of motion , in a manner similar to the decoupling limit , but where the effect of spatial curvature is taken into account explicitly . <n> it is well known that einstein s theory of general relativity has two branches , which are de sitter and anti - de sitter . in the former case ,<n> lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken , while in the latter it is preserved . for a long time , it was believed that the former solution should be stable , since it is a dynamical attractor , i.e. , there is no superluminal mode . however , this was not the case in the early universe , where gravitation was not an attractor even in the de sitter limit . recently<n> , several attempts have been made to solve this problem by introducing so - called proxy theories @xcite . here , we will show that this approach can lead to a class of solutions which can exhibit degravtation , provided one takes into account spatial curvature , as opposed to spatial curvature in the we propose the existence of a new scalar field with a mass of the order of the hubble scale which we call a @xmath0-field .<n> we show that this new field can be a dark energy candidate and that it can be coupled to gravity in a similar way to the standard @xcite brane - world model . in this scenario ,<n> the dark energy is not a scalar field but rather a superposition of two scalar fields , one of which is a helicity-0 vacuum state and the other is a vacuum state with a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts that the universe is filled with matter and that gravity is the dominant force driving the evolution of the universe . however , recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have shown that the present day universe is dominated by radiation and that matter is dominating . + in this letter we propose a new scenario for the origin of the present universe in which the universe undergoes a transition from a radiation - dominated era to a matter - dominated one . at early times<n> , the universe was structure formation in a @xmath0cdm - like cosmology is shown to be modified by the addition of a helicity-0 force to the usual newtonian force .<n> the effect is found to be negligible when the scalar field is considered as a source of vacuum polarization , but can become important when the field is added to the poisson equation as a matter density perturbation . <n> the formation of large scale structure is one of the most important open problems in cosmology . in order to solve this problem<n> it is necessary to find a mechanism that can give rise to the required amount of structure without the need to fine tune cosmological parameters @xcite . to this end<n> , it is often assumed that structure formation is independent of the background geometry , i.e. that it is unaffected by the presence of the vacuum polarization of the field . here<n> we show that this is not always the case . by studying the effect of a scalar field with a non - zero vacuum polarization on the structure formation of a cosmological background ,<n> we demonstrate that the usual assumption of negligible vacuum polarization can be significantly violated , leading to significant extra force acting on structure formation compared to the case where the vacuum is screened . as a result self - accelerating solutions to the friedmann equations in the jordan and einstein frames are compared .<n> we find that the einstein frame yields a ghostlike instabilities , while the jordan frame does not . in both cases<n> we show that the theory is stable . <n> _ introduction _ the study of accelerating self - gravitating systems has a long history , going back to the work of dirac , pauli , and schwarzschild on black holes ( @xcite,@xcite ) . since then , accelerating black holes have been studied in a variety of frames , from non - relativistic to relativistic ones , with varying degrees of success . for relativistic black holes ,<n> a natural question to ask is : what is the nature of the acceleration process ?<n> it has been proposed that black holes are driven by a cosmological constant , the cosmological ricci scalar @xmath0 , which acts as a proxy for the gravitational field , e.g. , in the context of string theory , but also in gravitational wave detectors , gravitational wave fronts , particle physics , cosmology , etc .. in the last decade , we show that in the regime of validity of general relativity ( gr ) and on galactic scales massive gravity is in conflict with the null energy condition .<n> this conflict is caused by the vainshtein mechanism , where the effects of massive gravity might be cloaked by corrections from a modified gravity model . on solar system and galactic scales gravity is very well compatible with gr and correctional terms from a modification gravity model are excluded . [ [ section ] ] in his celebrated paper @xcite gr was first formulated as a mathematical theory of gravity . since then various modifications have been proposed to it , most notably the einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( e - m - d ) theory which was derived from the quantum field theory of einstein . in its original formulation gr<n> was formulated in the jordan frame , which is the frame at which the action is conformally covariant with respect to the metric , and was later generalized to a class of theories in which the lagrangian is not conformally invariant . among these<n> are the @xmath0 super yang - mills ( s - j - m ) theories and the massive gravity theories which are based on a massive scalar field and a spin we study the cosmological application of the vainshtein mechanism in the context of the theory of massive gravity .<n> we show that massive gravity modifies the expansion dynamics of the universe by suppressing the self - interaction of the galileon , leading to a cosmic expansion that is of similar magnitudes today as in the case of @xmath0cdm . as a result ,<n> the symmetron mode becomes decoupled from matter and light on short distances , which could have observational signatures on larger scales in cosmic structure formation . in this paper we propose to construct a newtonian gravitational theory using massive gravity , but to proceed from this theory to provide observationally testable quantities .<n> a proxy theory is introduced which makes use of the homogeneous dynamics of the universe , the nonlinear structure formation and the shape of geodesics of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles . in our proxy theory , from the modified field equation the hubble - function<n> can be derived easily , which allows the definition of distance measures , needed in the interpretation of supernova data . we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) can be expressed as a sum of adiabatic and isocurvature terms .<n> the former is proportional to the cosmological constant @xmath0 and the latter is a function of the eos parameter . as a result ,<n> the difference between the two eoses is determined only by the ratio of the curvature scalar in the isotropic limit to the effective cosmological constant . <n> the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the boomerang and maxima satellites provide the first direct evidence for an accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite . at the same time , dark energy models , which have been proposed to explain the origin of the large scale structure in the universe , suffer from the so - called  dark energy problem '' , i.e. , they can not explain the large amount of energy that has been extracted from the universe without violating some constraints on the energy density of dark energy . in order to alleviate this problem , it has been suggested that dark energy could be described by a scalar field with a negative pressure , called the dark fluid , whose pressure is proportional recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy @xmath0 by the wilkinson microwave anisotropic probe ( wmap ) and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) at high redshift indicate that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating .<n> we show that this acceleration can be explained by the existence of a dark - energy component with negative pressure , which is coupled to the universe through dark - matter gravity . in this scenario ,<n> the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy is positive , and the equation - of - state parameter of dark matter ( dm ) is negative . as a result<n> , the energy density of the dark energy can be very large , up to the order of the hubble scale . <n> the discovery of the large scale structure in the universe @xcite has been one of the most important cosmological puzzles for the last three decades . the origin of this structure is still unknown , but it is believed to be related to the early universe , i.e. , to the so - called dark energy , whose existence is required for the successful description of the present universe by means of the standard model of particle physics we report the result of the search for axion dark matter ( dm ) with the pamela , atic , and fermi experiments .<n> the dm annihilation cross section is measured to be @xmath0 , which is consistent with the previous dm direct detection results . <n> the observation of axion - like particles in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been one of the most important cosmological goals in particle physics since the proposal of the planck satellite @xcite . in the standard cosmological model ( sm ) ,<n> the axion is the dominant component of the primordial density perturbations , followed by helium and hydrogen . however , in several extensions of the sm , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or the non - minimal supergravity ( nmssg ) model , an additional axion component is required to explain the origin of the cmb anisotropies . among these extensions , dm models with a dm component in the form of an axion monopole ( a@xmath1 )<n> have been extensively studied in the literature , as they can naturally account for the aniso recent observations of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , combined with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and large scale structure ( lss ) data , have established that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate .<n> this has been interpreted in terms of the existence of an accelerating expansion in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , which is accompanied by a period of accelerated expansion of the universe . in order to account for the observed expansion ,<n> it has been proposed that the accelerated expansion is driven by a dark energy component , the so - called  dark matter '' , whose energy density is proportional to the hubble parameter , @xmath0 , and whose equation of state ( eos ) is very similar to that of the sm @xcite . <n> dark matter ( dm ) can be described by a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with a mass of order one percent of the mass of the dark energy , called the dm - wimp mass . if dm exists in the form of a dark sector , as in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) we present a qcd - improved factorization formula for the @xmath0-quark self - energy .<n> we show that the factorization of the quark propagator into a product of the gluon and quark condensates , known as the factorized gluon condensate ( fgc ) formula , leads to an analytic result for the gluonic contribution to the qcd strong coupling constant , which is in excellent agreement with the lattice qcd data . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new prediction for the strong coupling in the regime of small values of the bare gluon mass . <n> recently , the lattice formulation of qcd has reached a precision at the level of one part in 10@xmath1 . in this letter<n> , we will present a new approach to calculate the strong - coupling constant in the range of small gluon masses @xcite . to do so , first we summarize the results of the lattice calculations of the strong and electroweak coupling constants in the regimes of small and large bare gluons masses<n> . then we will summarize the lattice results for both the quarks and gluons within the fgc formalism . finally , in the following we consider the dynamics of a relativistic plasma under the influence of a magnetic field .<n> the magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and parallel to the propagation direction of the plasma . in the nonrelativistic regime ,<n> the plasma is radiatively cooled , and the equation of state ( eos ) is given by the einstein - maxwell - gauss - dirac ( emg ) theory . under certain conditions on the eos and the plasma density , the plasma undergoes a phase transition to a state with a non - zero net magnetization . <n> the physics of relativistic plasmas has attracted a lot of interest in recent years @xcite , due to the possibility of observing effects of relativistic effects in plasma physics , such as the coulomb drag and the lorentz - invariance violation ( liv ) of the density of states ( dos ) . the most prominent example of these effects are the liv and the magnetic - drag drag plasmas , which are described by the emg - robertson - walker ( rmw ) equation @xmath0 , where the hamiltonian is a linear combination of the kinetic energy and",

oscillator - like second order equation which can be solved analytically for @xmath3 , as considered before by kukulin _    in the case @xcite , and also for @xmath4 .    in the case @xmath5 , ginocchio solved the triaxial , axial , and spherical harmonic oscillators for the case @xmath5 and applied it to the study of antinucleons embedded in nuclei @xcite .     in the case @xmath6 is particularly relevant in nuclear physics , since it is usually pointed out as a necessary condition for occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in nuclei @xcite-@xcite . also the observed isospin dependence of and without the tensor interaction . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ again , the charge conjugation connects this problem with the ho for nucleons with pseudospin symmetry ( @xmath13 ) , but in this case the positive harmonic binding potential is @xmath14 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ note that , because the harmonic potential does not vanish for large distances but is a confining potential , it is possible to obtain particle bound - state solutions in the exact pseudospin limit @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ therefore , we believe that this connection between spin and pseudospin symmetry obtained by charge conjugation deserves to be more explored . in addition , after the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed as a relativistic symmetry by ginocchio @xcite , a link of it to chiral symmetry has been suggested based on sum rules calculations in relativistic chiral models that support a small value for @xmath8 @xcite . however , until now , a clear connection of pseudospin and chiral symmetries has not been established . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the main motivation of this paper is to shed some light in the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 chiral transformations . in order to do existence of antinucleons in nuclei and their spectrum . rices @xcite � . then , there results that the scalar and vector interactions preserve their lorentz structures whereas the anomalous magnetic - like interaction turns out to be a pseudoscalar interaction . � furthermore , in the 1 + 1 world there is no angular momentum so that the spin is absent . � therefore , the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation allows us to explore the physical consequences of the negative - energy states in a mathematically simpler and more physically transparent way . in this spirit � the two - dimensional version of the anomalous magnetic - like interaction linear in the space coordinate has also received attention @xcite-@xcite . � later this system was shown to be a particular case of a more general class of exactly solvable problems asc2 . � let us begin by presenting the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions . � the dirac equation for a particle with mass @xmath30 and a general potential @xmath31 , to be defined later , is formally the same as its 3 + 1 counterpart : @xmath32here @xmath33 and the @xmath34 matrices @xmath35 obey the usual relations @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the change sign under a parity transformation , whereas @xmath37 and @xmath59 , which commute with @xmath73 , remain the same . respect to @xmath27 . in terms of @xmath109 and @xmath110 the spinor is normalized as @xmath109 , so that @xmath109 and @xmath110 are square integrable functions . \\frac{i}{% \\hbar c}\\left ( \\sigma + 2mc^{2}\\right ) \\psi_{+}% \\end{array } \\right\\ } , \\mathrm{\\;for\\;}\\delta = 0\\mathrm{\\;with\\;}e = mc^{2 } \\label{isol_sol_delta=0}\\ ] ] and @xmath136 \\\\ \\\\ � \\displaystyle\\psi_{+ } ^{\\prime } -\\frac{v_{p}}{\\hbar c}\\,\\psi_{+ } = -\\frac{i}{% \\hbar c}\\left ( \\delta -2mc^{2}\\right ) \\psi_{-}% \\end{array } \\right\\ } , \\mathrm{\\;for\\;}\\sigma = 0\\mathrm{\\;with\\;}e = mc^{2 } \\label{isol_sol_sigma=0}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are normalization constants . � since , by parity conservation , @xmath22 must be an odd function of @xmath139 , its integral must be an even function of @ relativistic limit in the special cases @xmath151 and @xmath6 , which we will also consider later in the paper when we solve the dirac equation for harmonic oscillator potentials .    this is the case of @xmath8 and @xmath6 , which we will consider later in the paper when we solve the dirac equation for harmonic oscillator potentials .    this is the case of @xmath9 , eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eq_mot_nr2a ] ) becomes @xmath152    here we clearly see that @xmath8 plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit and that @xmath22 gives rise to effective binding potentials proportional to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .     this means that even a pseudoscalar potential unbounded from below could be a confining potential . relativistic binding potentials may not bind in the nonrelativistic limit .     this is the case of @xmath164 ( @xmath11 ) referred before , and is basically due to the fact that vector potentials couple in a different way than scalar potentials in the dirac equation , whereas there is no such distinction in the schrdinger equation . actually , as we have seen before , @xmath8 , which is the sum of a vector and a scalar potential , plays the role of a binding potential in the nonrelativistic limit , whereas a weak enough @xmath14 can not bind a fermion with nonrelativistic energy if @xmath6 . - known solution of the schrdinger equation for the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator ( see , _   , e.g. _ , @xcite ) : @xmath179 where @xmath180 , @xmath181 is a normalization constant , @xmath182 is a @xmath183-th degree hermite polynomial and @xmath184    the lower component of the dirac spinor is obtained from ( psi-_delta=0 ) .    when one uses the recursion relations for the hermite polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) one gets @xmath185    [ [ e^{-\\lambda ^{2}x^{2}/2 } \\label{psi-_delta=0_oh}\\ ] ] since the hermite polynomial @xmath186 has @xmath187 distinct zeros one may conclude that @xmath120 has @xmath183 nodes , and the expression for @xmath123 suggests that it has @xmath188 nodes , depending on the sign @xmath26 . in fact ,    [ e^{-\\lambda ^{2} math192 and @xmath207 , respectively ( see eqs . escription ( [ psi-_delta=0_k1=0 ] ) ) . however , the spinors do depend on the sign of @xmath26 , because different signs induce different node structures , as can be seen from ( [ psi-_delta=0_k1=0 ] ) . escription since the charge - conjugation transformation changes the sign of @xmath26 , it connects both kinds of solutions , but each can have both positive and negative energies . escription therefore a complete set of states for a certain @xmath26 includes both particle ( positive energy ) and antiparticle ( negative energy ) states but they are not related to each other by a charge - conjugation transformation . escription the spectral gap between these solutions is @xmath213 and does not disappear when @xmath214 . escription therefore , there is no room for transitions from positive- to negative - energy solutions and klein s paradox never comes into play . escription there are no scattering states when @xmath204 , but for @xmath215 the continuum states are those ones which have energies beyond the limits expressed by ( limit_values_k1_ upper and lower components , so that the second - order equation to solve in this case is the one for the lower component , eq . � ( [ 2_order_sigma=0_psi- ] ) . the upper component would be obtained from the corresponding first - order equation eq . � ( [ psi+_sigma=0 ] ) . as a final remark � , one may note that for massless particles , the @xmath5 and @xmath234 oscillators have the same spectrum with the sign of @xmath201 reversed .    in 3 + 1 dimensions the corresponding eigenvalue equations to eqs . � ( eigen_eq_delta=0 ) and ( [ eigen_eq_sigma=0 ] ) have a very similar structure .    in 3 + 1 dimensions we see that , for @xmath9 , one just adds the dirac equation quantum number @xmath19 to the coefficient of @xmath19 to the coefficient of @xmath26 and modifies the coefficient of the square root to include the orbital angular momentum @xmath235 of the upper component @xmath236 while for @xmath6 one uses the orbital angular momentum @ general properties of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 transformations which hold in 3 + 1 dimensions . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ although we have already solved this case , it is presented here for the sake of completeness . for @xmath204 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ , @xmath242 is just a nonnegative constant function as can be seen from eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ energy_eigen_k1=0 ] ) , having two symmetric intersections with the parabola . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig1 ] and fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the first shows how the values of the energy are obtained from the intersection of the two curves and the second how the eigenvalues vary with @xmath26 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the energies for the zero mass case can also be computed from the intersections with the dashed parabola in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig1 ] and fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @x furthermore , the positive and negative solutions are such that @xmath265 , since , when @xmath266 and @xmath26 negative there is a solution with @xmath267 , but this is an isolated solution out of the sturm - liouville problem we are considering .    the considerations of the previous paragraph can be further elaborated by analyzing the behavior of the function @xmath268 @xmath269 according to what was stated in the previous paragraph , if @xmath270 one has two solutions for each @xmath183 , and if @xmath271 there is just one solution for each @xmath183 . to determine the signs of @xmath268 for each value of @xmath26 , we will need to know the values of @xmath26 which are roots of @xmath272 , or of the equation @xmath273 excluding the solution @xmath274 . applying descartes rule of signs to this last equation , we see that it can only have a positive real solution .     the rule states that the number of positive real roots @xmath268 for each value of @xmath26 , we will need to know the values of @xmath26 which are roots of @x It is clear from the plots of @xmath26 and @xmath302 that there are only positive -

[ fig4 ] it is clear from the plots of @xmath306 and @xmath305 that there are only positive - energy solutions coming from the dirac sea .

see the input parameters and the ids for our different models in table  [ t : table1 ] ) . in order to study the jet interactions considering an extensive range of values of the impact parameter  [ f : projzenerall ] , we also ran an additional simulation with a large impact parameter ( p = 1.3 ; model p130v18 ) .    in those cases when we adopted slow injection velocities for the second jet ( v@xmath56@xmath49 ) , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision region .     in those cases when we adopted slow injection velocities for the second jet ( v@xmath56@xmath49 ) , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision two jets still propagate in roughly the same plane ( see figure  [ f : projyenerall ] ) , but the plane is rotated relative to the horizontal direction by an angle which is larger for smaller impact parameters and larger velocity differences between the two jets .    in those cases when the second jet is much slower than the first , the two jets may merge , and the bending angle after collision of the slower jet is larger for higher velocity differences between the two jets ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    in those cases when the second jet is much slower than the first , the two jets may merge , and the bending angle after collision of the slower jet is larger for higher velocity differences between the two jets ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .     based on our results , we can classify colliding jets into two categories : ( 1 ) bouncing and ( 2 ) merging jets .     we illustrate the difference between these two categories in the first and second columns in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] . in this figure  [ f : qphasediagram ] we display the total energy density , scaled entropy per particle jet increases .      the jets merge when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small ( magenta and dark blue pixels ;

see also the trend from left to right in the different columns in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    we notice that the jets in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] do not seem to expand where they meet , therefore the jets in our simulations with p = 1 and 1.3 do not actually collide .    we notice that , however , interestingly , comparing the 2nd and 3rd panels ( p = 1 and 1.3 ) in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] with the last panel ( p = @xmath81 ) , we notice that the two jets still interact with each other via turbulence , which enhances the instabilities and generates oscillations traveling down the jets .    studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations  [ f : test3356projz ] , we notice that in some cases the jets break into filaments due to instabilities ( e.g. , mo dels p080v18 , p100v18 , and sngv18 , columns 4 , 5 , and ] , and p130v18 ) . it can be seen from this figure that more enstrophy is generated right after the collision when we adopt smaller impact parameters . the largest enstrophy peaks ( @xmath89 ) belong to the four smallest impact parameters ( p = 0 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 ) . ㅋ the bottom panel of figure  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] shows the maximum of the enstrophy as a function of the impact parameter for interacting jets ( @xmath90 ) . ㅋ the enstrophy maximum shows a `` phase transition '' as a function of the impact parameter at a critical point , @xmath91 . ㅋ small impact parameters , @xmath92 , result in large enstrophy maxima , @xmath93 , in the transition region around @xmath94 , the enstrophy drops to about half of this value , and for large impact parameters , @xmath95 , the maximum is @xmath96 . ㅋ a likely explanation for this `` phase transition '' is the following . at the collision region of the two jets , ㅋ small impact parameters , @xmath92 , result in large enstrophy maxima , @x [ e : enstrgen ] ) are fluctuating around zero , thus their time integral will be negligible and they do not contribute significantly to the enstrophy . the stretching term ( 1st term in equation  [ e : enstrgen ] ) � has a shape similar to the of the enstrophy ( black solid line ) . � as expected , this term is always positive ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � * ) , and , as a consequence , the contribution from stretching dominates the enstrophy generation . � note , however , that @xcite used equations of incompressible fluid dynamics in their analysis , and our simulations were based on compressible fluid dynamics , which is more appropriate for astrophysical applications . � the two bipolar jet system in 3c 75 is located in the dumbbell shaped twin wide angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxy ngc 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster abell 400 at a redshift of 0.023 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? � the two bipolar jet system in 3c 75 is located in the dumbbell shaped twin wide angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxy ngc 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster abell rotation angles around the direction of the propagation of the jet : @xmath100 0@xmath40 , 30@xmath40 , 30@xmath40 , 60@xmath40 , 90@xmath40 , 120@xmath40 , 150@xmath40                                                  � monuclear flashes at the university of chicago . value at injection for each model .",

In this paper , we have shown that both the pure fermionic dark matter models and neutrino - cdm - mixture models reproduce the observations equally well .",

independent potentials on small time intervals . � this result was extended to global in time convergence by l. erds and h .- � these proofs involve infinite neumann ( diagrammatic ) expansions for the solution of the schrdinger equation and are quite involved technically . � the corresponding problem with time - dependent potentials is much simpler mathematically . � it was treated by us in @xcite in the markovian case , and by f. poupaud and l. erds and h .- � these proofs involve infinite neumann ( diagrammatic ) expansions for the solution of the schrdinger equation and dimensional random medium .    a formal derivation of the paraxial approximation that leads to the radiative transfer regime is given below in section [ sec : scaling ] .    we assume that the original source is located in the plane @xmath17 , and the time - reversal mirror is located in the plane @xmath18 as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .          during the first stage of a time reversal experiment the signal propagates for a time @xmath19 , or equivalently , over a distance @xmath20 , so that the signal arriving at the time - reversal mirror is given by @xmath21 where the green s function solves @xmath22 then the signal is time reversed . for three - dimensional acoustic pulses    , this means that the pressure field is kept unchanged and that the sign of its time derivative is reversed . in the parabolic approximation , this is equivalent to phase conjugation , where @xmath11 is replaced by its complex conjugate @xmath20 , so that the signal arriving at the time - reversal mirror is given by @xmath21 where the green s function solves @xmath22 then the signal is time reversed . for three - dimensional math44 measures the strength of the fluctuation . @xmath81 as in @xcite , @xmath82 which satisfies the initial value problem @xmath83 it physically describes the component with wave vector @xmath84 that is sent back to the plane @xmath17 by the array . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we then define the wigner transform as @xmath85 where @xmath86 the wigner transform @xmath87 is more regular than @xmath88 because of additional averaging in the wave vector @xmath84 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ more , precisely , while the family @xmath88 is not uniformly bounded in @xmath0 , the family @xmath87 has a uniform bound in @xmath0 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this regularizing effect is essentially the same as the one obtained by considering mixtures of states for the schrdinger equation as in @xcite . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we can then recast ( [ eq : psibeps2 ] ) as @xmath89 the above formula shows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath90 as @xmath91 is characterized by that of the wigner transform @xmath92 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this section presents our two main results . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this section presents our two main results . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the first one be written as @xmath118 the kernel @xmath119 is the fourier transform in @xmath120 of the solution of ( [ eq : treqformal ] ) . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ we deduce from this formula that the back -

Unfortunately, this can be considered an extremely conservative estimate of the errors , taking into account a wide variety of atmospheric and observing conditions that affect flux calibration .   Unfortunately, most filters have modest flux calibration errors ( for mid - infrared observations ) with standard deviations between 2 and 10% .   Unfortunately, flux calibration through certain filters is more difficult due to the presence of various atmospheric absorption lines contaminating the filter bandpass , some of which can be highly variable .   Unfortunately, the flux calibration through those filters most affected are the 7.7 @xmath0 m ( 21% ) , 12.3 @xmath0 m ( 19% ) , 18.3 @xmath0 m ( 15% ) , and 24.6 @xmath0 m ( 23% ) filters .    Unfortunately, the flux calibration through these filters may be affected by the presence of certain spectral features common to young stellar objects .     Unfortunately, the flux calibration through these filters may be skewed to higher values due to the presence of certain spectral features common to young stellar objects .

infrared flux densities of most of the sources . because this wavelength range is very sensitive to the geometry of the source , here we extend that work by including rotation and flattening of the envelope in the models , so that the results can be tested with the new mid - infrared data presented in this paper . � for this purpose , we have followed procedures similar to those already developed in low - mass star models ( osorio et al . � 2003 ) . � envelopes with a density distribution such as that given by terebey , shu , & cassen ( 1984 , hereafter tsc envelopes ) assume that the rotation of the infalling material becomes important written as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cmu density distribution for the same @xmath41 and @xmath38 , and @xmath42 is a measure of the degree of flattening ( hartmann et al . \u0013 the degree of flattening in these envelopes is measured by the parameter @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the outer radius of the envelope and @xmath45 is the scale height . � hereafter , we will designate them as @xmath42-envelopes . � the scale of this density distribution can be set by using the parameter @xmath46 , defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a reference radius . � this reference density corresponds to the density that a spherically symmetric free - falling envelope with the same mass accretion rate , @xmath27 , would have at the reference radius @xmath48 . in our modeling � the scale of this density distribution can be set by using the parameter @xmath47 , defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a reference radius . � this reference density corresponds to the density that a spherically symmetric free - falling envelope with the same our models we use a recently improved dust opacity law , corresponding to a mixture of compounds that was adjusted by matching the observations of the well known low - mass protostar l1551 irs5 ( osorio et al . 2003 ) .     this mixture includes graphite , astronomical silicates , troilite and water ice , with the standard grain - size distribution of the interstellar medium , @xmath54 , with a minimum size of 0.005  @xmath0 m and a maximum size of 0.3  @xmath0 m .     the details of the dust opacity calculations are described by dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) .    the inner radius of the envelope , @xmath55 , is taken to be the dust destruction radius , that is assumed to occur at a temperature of 1200 k , corresponding to the sublimation temperature of silicates at low densities ( dalessio 1996 ) .    the centrifugal radius is assumed to be considerably larger than the centrifugal radius is assumed to be considerably larger than the dust destruction radius in order to have a significant degree of flattening due to rotation in the inner envelope . rain the value of the luminosity by fitting the mid - infrared data closer to the sed peak , that are helpful to set a lower limit for the luminosity . \u001c on the other hand , the depth and shape of the silicate absorption feature ( which is very well delineated by our mid - infrared data ) determines the extinction along the line - of - sight , that in turn is related to the inclination angle , @xmath51 , the density scale , @xmath46 , and the centrifugal radius , @xmath38 . \u001c the depth of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption increases not only with the density scale of the envelope , but also with the inclination angle , since the extinction is much smaller along the rotational pole ( @xmath60 ) than along the equator ( @xmath59 ) ( see osorio et al . \u001c thus , the behavior of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath51 is somewhat interchangeable in the mid - infrared ( although such behavior is different at millimeter wavelengths ) . for instance , an envelope with a combination of low density and high inclination could have an extinction and mid - infrared emission similar to an envelope with a higher density but viewed pole - on . ) , while the lower limit is set by the smallest values recently reported for protoplanetary disks around low - mass ysos ( rodrguez et al . � 2005 ) . � from the values of the parameters obtained from our fits to the observed seds we can derive other physical parameters , such as the total mass of the envelope , @xmath65 , obtained by integration of the density distribution , and the mass of the central star , @xmath25 , derived from its luminosity , @xmath52 . � once the mass of the star is known , the mass accretion rate in the envelope , @xmath27 , can be derived from the value of @xmath46 . � yorke ( 1984 ) and walmsley ( 1995 ) proposed that some objects could be accreting material at a rate high enough to quench the development of an incipient hii region . � these objects would lack detectable free - free emission , being good candidates to be the precursors of the uchii regions . in the case of spherical accretion , it is easy to show that the critical mass accretion rate required to reduce the hii region to a small volume close to the stellar surface is @ of these distant sources from contamination of other sources in their vicinity . and mid - infrared images ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) and therefore , we have only an upper limit for its size . � because we considered the far - infrared , submillimeter and millimeter data only as upper limits , the luminosity of this source is constrained essentially by the data at wavelengths near 20  @xmath0 m , that indicate that this is a low luminosity source . � we obtain a value of 75 @xmath76 for the luminosity of this object , corresponding to a a0 star of 5 @xmath14 . � since we only have upper limits for the flux densities in the submillimeter - millimeter wavelength range , we can not constrain the density and inclination simultaneously . therefore , we searched for fits both at low ( @xmath51=20@xmath77 - 30@xmath77 ) and high inclination angles ( @xmath51=50@xmath77 - 60@xmath77 ) . at low inclination angles , we obtained a quite good fit for @xmath7830@xmath77 , @xmath79 g @xmath80 , @xmath81 au ( dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig5 ] ) , but this model a reasonable fit ( solid - line in figure [ fig6 ] ) , explaining simultaneously the strong millimeter emission as well as the near - infrared flux densities , is obtained by assuming an extremely dense ( @xmath91 g @xmath80 ) , and therefore very massive envelope ( @xmath92 ) , with a centrifugal radius of @xmath93 au , seen with a low inclination angle ( @xmath94 ) , and heated by a luminous ( @xmath95 ) b1 star ( see tables 5 and 6 ) . this value of the luminosity is a lower limit , since it is the smallest value that is consistent with the mid - infrared and millimeter data points , and we estimate that it can be higher up to a factor of three .     likewise , we estimate that the uncertainty in the density scale is @xmath330% , and that the range of plausible values is @xmath96 for the inclination angle , and @xmath97 au for the centrifugal radius .     it is worthwhile to note that the 9.7 @xmath0 m data point is only an upper limit , since it does not set the depth of the silicate absorption feature . also , we want to point out ,000 au , olmi et al . \u001c 2003 ) and some other high - mass protostars ( 1000 - 30000 au , see cesaroni 2005 and references therein ) .      these structures have been interpreted by some authors as tracing large - scale disks or rotating toroids .      our results suggest that these structures could be naturally explained as infalling flattened envelopes ( with sizes of thousands of aus ) , rather than as large circumstellar disks .      our results suggest that the formation of such disks is expected to occur at a scale of the order of @xmath38 , which according to our models could be of the order of hundreds of aus .         in order to compare the predicted sed of the g45.07 + 0.13 hmpo with the data , we use the existing millimeter observations ( taken from su et al . 2004 ) only as upper limits , since they do not have an angular resolution high enough to separate the hmpo emission from that of the uc region . we have obtained mid - infrared data for four hmpo candidates at gemini observatory .    these data have the subarcsecond angular resolution necessary to isolate the emission of the hmpo candidates from that of nearby sources . obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .      , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the particle physics and astronomy research council ( united kingdom ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , cnpq ( brazil ) and conicet ( argentina ) .      , the gemini program identification numbers associated with the data presented here are gs-2003b -

? ? * for a description of these observations ) and taken from the jcmt archive for this study .     the archive map is smaller than we note that for sources with self absorbed hco@xmath0 profiles , the peak line temperature is an underestimate of the source brightness temperature .    in our maps ,    we find that the hco@xmath0 emission towards each source is extended , as is the h@xmath1co@xmath0 emission ; however , h@xmath1co@xmath0 does not reach the same spatial scales as the 77 times more abundant ( wilson & rood , 1994 ) hco@xmath0 . in only five of our seven sources     in our maps ,    we find that the deconvolved source size was determined using @xmath10 where the longest axis of the observed region full width at half maximum diameter ( @xmath11 ) was used to compare to the beam diameter ( @xmath12 ) . towards the two unresolved sources ( k3 - 50a and g19.61 ) , the deconvolved diameter of the emitting region is less than 50% of the jcmt primary beam , while the deconvolved diameter is greater than 70% of the jcmt primary beam towards our other sources .    in our maps , _prop ] , respectively . \u001c the integrated intensities in sio and hco@xmath0 were used to find the column density of gas emitting across the map in that tracer . for optically thin gas , \u001c the column density in the higher energy level is proportional to the integrated intensity of the line , with a scaling constant proportional to the frequency of the transition and the einstein coefficient for that transition ( see equation 1 of paper 1 , or * ? ? ? \u001c the column density in the lower energy level is proportional to the integrated intensity of the line , with a scaling constant proportional to the frequency of the transition and the einstein coefficient for that transition ( see equation 1 of paper 1 , or * ? ? ? \u001c assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and an ambient temperature of 44 k ( as was done in paper 1 ) , we can use the partition function to determine the column density of optically thin gas in each tracer ( see for instance equation 14.38 of * ? ? ? \u001c the average column densities of sio and hco@xmath0 are presented in tables [ tab : sio_prop ] and [ tab : hco_prop ] . \u001c the values for the h@xmath @xcite is dependent on the assumed distance to the source ( see their equations 7 and 12 ) .    thus , our sio abundance has changed from -9.53 in paper 1 to -10.42 when the new distance and revised column density are taken into account .    thus , the sio abundance determined for k3 - 50a in paper 1 is much closer to that found in dark clouds than in outflow regions .    thus , the region in which sio is emitting is unresolved by our observations and highly beam diluted .     thus , for our analysis , we have assumed an sio abundance of -10.15 , the average abundance from our other six sources .     thus , based on the abundance estimates presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] , we have determined the total column of shocked material towards each source , from which we determined the mass of shocked gas because we know the area of the emitting region ( see below ) . for our sources which are unresolved in sio    thus , we have taken the radius of our primary beam to be the radius of the emitting region .    comparing the integrated intensities of our sio emission in the central pixel � these thermal energies are of approximately the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energies calculated for the co outflows in a number of massive star forming regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; similarly the wind luminosities are comparable to the luminosities of their hii regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; and many authors suggest that an asymmetric self absorbed line profile of an optically thick line tracer in which the blue emission peak is brighter than the red , and the optically thin tracer has a single line peak , can be indicative of infall ( i.e. * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � , our optically thick line is hco@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) and the optically thin isotopologue is h@xmath1co@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) .    from paper 1 􀀀 , we expected to observe infall signatures in g10.47 and g19.61 .    in paper 1 􀀀 .    it is quite possible that there is a second instance of a collapsing region here since sio is marginally detected ( at the 3@xmath13 level ) in the middle of this northern extension .    the double peaked profiles do lead to infall velocities ( in three pixels ) which are greater than 3@xmath13 ; however , we do not include this region in our infall analysis for a number of reasons .    it is interesting to note that the infall signature is not continuous from the central region to this northern region , which suggests that there are two distinct regions of infall .    it is interesting to note that this discontinuity would confuse conclusions about the central infall region .    it is interesting to note that we are interested in the infall activity surrounding hii regions , where we know massive stars are forming .    it is interesting to note that neither the mid infrared nor radio maps of this region ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) extend far enough to the north to determine whether there are hii regions in this northern extension .    we are interested in the infall activity surrounding hii regions , where we know massive stars are forming .    we are interested in the is interesting to note that the infall and outflow signatures in g19.61 are both unresolved , and the signatures in g20.08 are both marginally resolved .      this comparison suggests that the shocked region , as traced by sio , may have a similar physical size as the infall regions in these smaller sources . towards g10.6 and g10.47 , the regions over which we have robustly detected extended infall , our deconvolved sio emitting regions also appear to be on the same approximate spatial scales .          when comparing infall mass and outflow mass , we note that our infall masses are lower than our outflow masses .        this is contrary to the results of @xcite ; however , their ratio was calculated for the protostellar jet , not the entrained molecular outflow .         this comparison to @xcite suggests that more of the ambient mass is entrained into the large scale molecular outflow ( produced by a protostellar jet ) than falls in onto the forming stars ( i.e. * ?

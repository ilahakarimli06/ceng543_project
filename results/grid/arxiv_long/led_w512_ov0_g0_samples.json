Where @xmath239 ( see @xcite ) . � if we compare these equations with ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) and ( [ eigen_eq_sigma=0 ] ) , we see that the main features are identical , and thus all the main results obtained in the next section remain valid for the relativistic harmonic oscillator in three spatial dimensions . � we turn now to the solutions of eq . � ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) . in order to obtain a deeper insight on those solutions for arbitrary  embodiments @xmath199 and @xmath201 one has to seek a convenient method for solving this transcendental equation . if we square eq . � ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) the resulting equation is in general a quartic algebraic equation in @xmath57 , which in principle can be solved analytically . � the price paid is that some spurious roots can appear in this process , although , of course , these can be eliminated by checking whether they satisfy the original equation . � a more instructive procedure is follow a graphical method , by which one seeks the intersection points of the functions of energy in general properties of charge - conjugation and @xmath0 transformations which hold in 3 + 1 dimensions . � although we have already solved this case , it is presented here for the sake of completeness . for @xmath204 � , @xmath242 is just a nonnegative constant function as can be seen from eq . � ( [ energy_eigen_k1=0 ] ) , having two symmetric intersections with the parabola . � [ fig1 ] and fig . � [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 . � the first shows how the values of the energy are obtained from the intersection of the two curves and the second how the eigenvalues vary with @xmath26 . � the energies for the zero mass case can also be computed from the intersections with the dashed parabola in fig . � [ fig1 ] and fig . � [ fig2 ] present the results for the first four quantum numbers . in these and the following plots we use the scaled quantities @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @x , we have first to determine the minimum of @xmath242 , which occurs when the expression under the square root in ( [ def_f_s ] ) is zero : @xmath254 this value sets a lower bound for the energies of all the solutions of eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) . for @xmath255 , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the function @xmath242 takes the value @xmath256 and @xmath257 takes the value @xmath258 when @xmath227 , the minimum of @xmath259 occurs for negative values of the energy , that is , on the left ( and decreasing ) side of the parabola . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if @xmath260 there is only one solution of eq . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) and it has positive energy . from ( [ f_s_min ] ) , this can happen only for @xmath207 , since @xmath261 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if @xmath262 there are _ always _ two solutions , one negative and one positive , because @xmath263 is always positive , no matter how large is @xmath264 , for a positive @xmath25 . xmath278 ( not counting the null coefficients ) and , if less , then differs from @xmath277 by an even number .     this means that @xmath275 can take the values @xmath279 , @xmath212 . in this case , for positive @xmath25 , there is only one such sign change and therefore there is only a positive and unique solution , which we shall call @xmath280 .      this means that the function @xmath268 changes sign at @xmath281 and @xmath282 , being negative in the interval @xmath283 and positive outside this interval . It is important to note these features , as can be seen from the plots of @xmath259 when @xmath26 is negative .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and [ fig4 ] it is clearly seen that for values of @xmath26 between zero and @xmath302 there are only positive - energy solutions .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and [ fig4 ] it is clearly seen that for values of @xmath26 between zero and @xmath302 there are only positive - energy solutions .    in fig .   [ fig4 ] and moreover , one can see from eq .  ( [ fs_min = fp_min ] ) that the value of @xmath302 increases with @xmath25 , meaning that when @xmath303 one reaches the limit of the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath304 ) where there are only positive bound - state solutions with @xmath305 .    [ fig4 ] and thus , the existence of the pseudoscalar potential gives rise to negative - energy solutions coming from the dirac sea .    [ fig4 ] and thus , for @xmath306 these kind of solutions always set of lower energy bounds of the negative - energy solutions for each pair of @xmath25 and @xmath26 values . � ( [ e_min ] ) , ( [ e_min ] ) , ( [ f_s_min ] ) and ( [ f_p_min ] ) , except that , of course , now @xmath199 is negative .    noting that @xmath293 at @xmath133 has a nonnegative value given by @xmath329 � , we see that there is always an infinite and unbounded set of negative - energy solutions ( one for each @xmath183 ) with @xmath222 . for @xmath289 and @xmath330 , � there is a solution with @xmath331 which was already discussed in the previous section . � however , when @xmath224 , one can solve eq . � ( [ isol_sol_delta=0 ] ) when @xmath133 and obtain a bound - state solution with both upper and lower components different from zero , if and only if @xmath332 . � one can show that this corresponds to a @xmath289 solution given by the functions ( psi+_delta=0_oh ) and ( [ psi-_delta=0_oh ] ) taking the limit @xmath333 . math347 , this means that when @xmath343 there is only one range of values of @xmath201 where @xmath348 whereas when @xmath349 there are two ranges of @xmath201 values where this happens . within these ranges , � only negative - energy solutions exist . � when @xmath350 , the value @xmath351 corresponds to an infinite set of degenerate negative - energy solutions with scaled energy @xmath352 , which , as mentioned before , are not bound - state solutions . � these features of the spectrum can be seen in figs . � [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .      as a function of @xmath253 . as in fig . � fig4 the three non - zero values of the roots of @xmath268 , @xmath353 , are marked with a cross in the energy axis . � as in that figure , the hollow circles mark the point ( @xmath354 , @xmath322 ) and the three points where ( @xmath282 , @xmath355 ) . � the dashed parabola represents the function @xmath356 ( see text).,width=377 ]     as point corresponds to the local minimum of @xmath268 , which , for @xmath364 , is very close to the double root @xmath365 .     , similarly as in the case of @xmath227 , the solutions with @xmath366 have infinite degeneracy , but they do not correspond to bounded solutions . again , for @xmath26 near @xmath302 there is a high density of very delocalized states .      the parabola @xmath359 sets now an upper bound ( @xmath316 ) for the positive - energy states .     the limits @xmath367 and @xmath347 correspond , respectively , to the harmonic oscillator solutions for negative - energy ( antiparticle ) states and to the dirac oscillator .     in the first case there are no bound states for particles ( positive - energy states ) . as @xmath368 increases , positive bound states start to appear .          to complete the study of solutions of equation ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) we present now a plot of its solutions     .      . see text).,width=377 ]    as before , we can recognize the dirac oscillator and the harmonic oscillator limits , as one sets @xmath189 and @xmath380 , respectively . in this last case , one has the harmonic oscillator solutions for particles or antiparticles depending whether @xmath25 goes to @xmath381 or @xmath382 .    in this last case , one can again see that the energy levels of the dirac oscillator are symmetric about @xmath383 and that there are no scattering states . here    we can see that this follows simply from the fact that @xmath189 is an asymptote of the hyperbole branches which separate the continuum region from the bound - state region .     as referred before , the case @xmath6 can be obtained from the @xmath9 case by applying the charge - conjugation transformation .     in this last case , we recall that this transformation performs the changes @xmath384 , @xmath385 and @xmath386 , or , for harmonic oscillator potentials , the changes @xmath387 and @xmath388 .    in this last case , we In the thorac equation of relativistic nuclear mean - field theories there is a connection between the ( isoscalar ) vector and tensor potential . � the latter is proportional to the derivative of the former @xcite . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , this would give , using the notation of ref . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , this would give , using the notation of ref . � for the harmonic oscillator potentials used in this paper , there should be an upper value for @xcite , the relation @xmath393the constant @xmath394 can take values up to around 1.3 in nuclei using relativistic mean - field potentials of woods - saxon type @xcite . for harmonic oscillator mean - field potentials , there should be also an upper value for @xmath395 , and therefore the relation ( [ k_2_k_1_f_v ] ) sets a maximum for @xmath396 in nuclei . � as was seen above , this is relevant to know whether there can be simultaneously nucleon and antinucleon bound states in nuclei . � this would depend very much xmath405 can be an arbitrary potential . for harmonic oscillator potentials , one has @xmath406 and @xmath388 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ since , as explained in sec . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ sec : rel_h_oscillator ] , the chiral transformation does not change the equations of motion , the energy of their solutions is not changed . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this can be seen in figs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , where are plotted , respectively , the solutions of the @xmath9 and @xmath407 eigenvalue equations , eqs . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ( [ eigen_eq_delta=0 ] ) and ( eigen_eq_sigma=0 ) , when @xmath251 , for @xmath6 and several @xmath26 values . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the basic features of these plots were already discussed in the previous section . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the conventions are the same as before , the @xmath383 isolated solution was excluded .      as a function of @xmath253 for @xmath9 and @xmath251 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the conventions are the same as in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the conventions are the same as in fig . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the conventions are or @xmath6 , @xmath412 would have also to be zero , and we would have a free ultrarelativistic particle , which has a good chirality , _ � i.e. _ , is an eigenstate of @xmath0 . � in this work we studied the solutions of 1 + 1 dirac equation with a potential with the most general lorentz structure which leads to harmonic oscillator potentials in the second - order differential equation for the spinor components . � we showed that this is achieved when the vector @xmath412 and scalar @xmath103 potentials are quadratic and satisfy either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and the pseudoscalar potential is linear . � we showed that there are no bound - state solutions in the nonrelativistic limit for @xmath11 and @xmath22 very small , meaning in this case we have an intrinsic relativistic problem . � we analyzed in great detail , by use of a graphical procedure , the solutions of the transcendental eigenvalue equation in the case of @xmath9 , for all signs of the potentials and for both particle and antiparticle states . � the solutions for @xmath6 from the @xmath9 case , using the charge - conjugation and chiral transformations .     in particular , we used the chiral transformation to show that , for massless fermions and zero pseudoscalar potential , the @xmath5 and @xmath11 solutions have the same spectrum .     these conclusions are quite general and do not depend on the number of dimensions so that they remain true in 3 + 1 dimensions .     also , most of the features of the 1 + 1 spectra presented in this work are also present in the 3 + 1 relativistic harmonic oscillator . indeed , since the 1 + 1 eigenvalue equations for @xmath9 and @xmath6 are very similar to the corresponding 3 + 1 equations , we can apply the same graphical methods to the 3 + 1 case , and therefore most of the analysis of the 1 + 1 case remains true with appropriate changes .     for instance , the shape of the parabola in the energy-@xmath26 plane related to @xmath413 would depend now on the value of the spin -

In section ii , for example , we find that the total deflection angle depends on the second body position and varies from a minimum equal to @xmath9 $ ] to a maximum @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the closest distance to the main body that the photon could reach , if it were an isolated body .    In section iii , the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we start with the metric describing the tidal environment around a gravitating body .    In section iii , we find the tidally perturbed metric in schwarzchid coordinates by a coordinate transformation ( from harmonic coordinates ) .    In section iv , we find the tidally perturbed metric in schwarzchid coordinates by a coordinate transformation ( from harmonic coordinates ) .    In section v , we would like to focus on the leading effects and neglect the smaller ones ; so we find the simultaneously weak field and slow motion limit of the metric .    In section v , we find that these perturbations to the metric are considered as static fields on a flat background .

[ ss : initialconditions ] , we ran the simulations for 50 myr . in those cases when we adopted slow injection velocities for the second jet ( v@xmath56@xmath49 ) , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision region .  [ ss : initialconditions ] , we ran the simulations for 70 myr in order to make sure that the slower jet propagates well away from the collision region .  [ ss : initialconditions the opposite direction .    in the first column in figures  [ f : projzenerall ] and [ f : projyenerall ] we show jet collisions with zero impact parameter ( p = 0 ) . in all these cases    in most of those cases , only one jet seems to emerge after the collision ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .    in most of those cases , however , because of symmetry , after the collision these jets are somewhat spread out in the out - of - collision - plane direction ( @xmath32 ; see figure  [ f : projyenerall ] ) .    in most of those cases where we adopted a finite impact parameter ( p @xmath61 )    after the collision , two jets can be seen after the collision . as a consequence of the large velocities , the jets bounce off each other and survive as individuals ( see figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) . in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] we can see that after the collision , the jets show increasing instabilities as the impact parameter is decreased , and in some cases , as a result of growing inst .  [ f : test3356projz ] the first column illustrates bouncing of two fast jets with v@xmath67 v@xmath51@xmath49 , and a large impact parameter , p = 0.8 ( model p080v18 ) ; the second column shows projections of a merging jet simulation with a small impact parameter , p = 0.3 , and large velocity difference : v@xmath68@xmath49vs .  [ f : test3356projz ] the first column illustrates bouncing of two fast jets with v@xmath67 v@xmath69@xmath49(model p030v10 ) .  [ f : test3356projz ] the jets propagate from left to right .  [ f : test3356projz ] the point of collision is in the middle of the left hand side of the energy panels marked with red ( see top left panel for each simulation ) .   [ f : test3356projz ] it can be seen clearly from figure  [ f : test3356projz ] that , after the collision , the bouncing jets ( 1st column ) keep their identities and travel relatively unaffected , while , in the case of jet increases .       the jets merge when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small ( magenta and dark blue pixels ; p000v10 , p000v12 , p000v14 , p015v10 , p015v12 , and p030v10 , see table  [ t : table1 ] ) , otherwise they bounce . since the @xmath31 components of the velocities of the jets have opposite signs , the relative value of this component decreases ( it should be zero for v@xmath75 = v@xmath76 ) , and , as a consequence , the angle between the bouncing jets decreases as does the spread between them . simulations show long wavelength oscillations along the jets with wavelengths in the range of 10 - 20 kpc , which is compatible to the expected wavelength of the reflection modes .    in the 3rd column in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] we show the total energy projected to the @xmath28 plane from our colliding jet simulations with fixed jet velocities : v@xmath75 = v@xmath51@xmath49 , but different impact parameters : p = 0.5 , 1 , 1.3 , and with p = @xmath81 representing two non - interacting pairs of jets ( top to bottom ; models : p045v18 , p100v18 , p130v18 , p130v18 , and sngv18 ) . in the case of non - interacting jets ( see bottom panel in the 3rd column ) , linear instabilities grow non - linear only after the jets travel about 20 kpc .     in the 3rd column in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] , however , it can be seen from the 3rd column in figure  [ f : test3356projz ] that the instabilities are enhanced in colliding in figure  [ f : projzenerall ] ) .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] our simulations show that , in general , filaments form in jets only far from the source ( @xmath8230 kpc ) unless the collision is strong , i.e , the impact parameter is small ( e.g. , models p045v18 and p080v18 ; compare top panels in columns 4 and 6 ) .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] , however , filaments of this form are not frequently seen in radio images of extragalactic jets , which is most likely due to the fact that the jets usually reach lower - pressure regions in the ambient medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop .  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] the effect of interaction between jets due to turbulence generated by collision can be quantified using the enstrophy density , the mean squared vorticity , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the vorticity at position @xmath85 ( note that , occasionally , it is defined without the 1/2 factor ) . in figure  [ f : enstrophyv18 ] we show the integrated enstrophy ( over @x ] , and p130v18 ) . it can be seen from this figure that more enstrophy is generated right after the collision when we adopt smaller impact parameters . the largest enstrophy peaks ( @xmath89 ) belong to the four smallest impact parameters ( p = 0 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.45 ) .

dm ratio , @xmath114 , the resultant profiles are essentially identical and they are not distinguishable from the general fermion cases . for @xmath115 and 0.5 , the smallest mass solutions are for @xmath130 and 1.1 ev respectively . \u001c it is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath1312% ) of deficiency in the model 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( 1.06@xmath132 ) . \u001c it is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath1312% ) of deficiency in the model 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( 1.06@xmath132 ) . \u001c a brightest cluster galaxy at the center of a cluster , typically has a stellar mass in excess of there is a dip of the fermi level in the model with the galaxy . in other words ,   the fermi level of the eos is softened locally by the stellar mass of the galaxy .    it should be emphasized that this is true only if the galaxy is given as an external mass source unaffected by the dark matter distribution .    it should be emphasized that also this effect is pronounced only near the origin of spherical symmetry , where the fractional contribution of the galaxy to the 3d encircled mass is the greatest .    so one may wonder how fermions at the cluster center could be degenerate . here   we first point out the fact that even relic neutrinos are moderately degenerate , which used to be well known @xcite , but appears to be forgotten lately .    we first point out that there is a clear distinction between the black body of fermions and that of bosons . while the range of values of the fermi distribution function for one - particle state is between 0 and 1 , that of the bose distribution function is between 0 and @xmath137 .    so the fermion black body is partially degenerate , while the boson , while neutrinos are relativistic .     there is a transition from the relativistic to nonrelativistic regime when @xmath144 .    below    @xmath145    or at @xmath146 , where @xmath1 is units of ev , neutrinos become nonrelativistic .    if @xmath146 is units of ev , neutrinos become relativistic .    if @xmath146 is units of ev , neutrinos become relativistic .    if @xmath146 is units of ev , then the expressions for both fermi level and neutrino temperature change , but they have the same dependence on @xmath147 .    as long as local gravity is negligible , nonrelativistic adiabatic expansion is assumed below @xmath148 ,    @xmath149^{2/3 } =   4.3\\times10^{-8 } m^{-1 } ( 1+z)^2\\hskip 2 cm ( { \\rm ev}),\\ ] ]    and    @xmath150 neutrinos can fall into the cluster core . ㅋ the cluster also has hot plasma , which may affect the fermion degeneracy . ㅋ here we briefly argue that the effect of hot plasma will be minor . ㅋ first of all , hot plasma and neutrinos ( or weakly interacting fermions in general ) interact only through gravity and the plasma temperature has nothing to do with the velocity dispersion of neutrinos , which is determined by the encircles mass at a given @xmath63 . ㅋ what matters is the plasma s contribution to the encircled mass ( or encircled gravitational energy if the plasma is relativistic ) . the ratio of gas mass and total mass has been estimated to be about 7% by x - ray observations ㅋ they interact with fermions only through newtonian gravity , because the plasma is not hot enough to be relativistic or the kinetic energy of a plasma particle is negligible compared to the rest - mass energy . therefore unless the plasma particles have exceptionally high concentration near the 3d center of the cluster , their effect on the encircled mass should be minor compared to that by the dark matter particles . however , an extreme high concentration is not expected unless the plasma temperature a lower particle mass . \u001c another possible improvement is that without fixing the density ratio of total matter and light fermions , the densities of light fermions and collisionless cold dark matter particles can be treated separately in terms of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the former and the jean equation for the latter , while they are coupled through the total encircled mass and the common velocity dispersion at a given @xmath63 . \u001c one cosmological subject related particularity to the degeneracy of relic massive neutrinos , is its potential effect on `` free streaming '' . \u001c relic neutrinos are hot dark matter , which were relativistic , when they decoupled . from the picture of completely collisionless particles , it is considered that small - scale fluctuations in the primordial neutrino density fluctuation spectrum should have been wiped out . \u001c however , the partial degeneracy of relic neutrinos implies that not all of them could have behaved as free particles . \u001c it is conceivable that the effect of fermi - dirac degeneracy is to suppress the `` free streaming '' or to preserve the initial fluctuation spectrum . \u001c depending on the degree of this `` free - streaming suppression '' of neut @xmath161 ( 4.3,73 ) & b + & dirac ( p ) or majorana ( p+@xmath162 ) & 2 & ( 3.3,93 ) @xmath161 ( 3.6,70 ) & i + & dirac ( p+@xmath162 ) & 4 & ( 2.8,100 ) @xmath161 ( 3.1,73 ) & a + 0.5 & majorana ( p ) & 1 & ( 3.4,100 ) @xmath161 ( 3.7,73 ) & a + & dirac ( p ) or majorana ( p+@xmath162 ) & 2 & ( 2.9,106 ) @xmath161 ( 3.1,73 ) & i + & dirac ( p+@xmath162 ) & a + 0.5 & majorana ( p+@xmath162 ) & 2 & ( 3.9,106 ) @xmath161 ( 3.1,73 ) & i + & dirac ( p+@xmath162 ) & 4 & ( 2.4,100 ) @xmath161 ( 2.6,73 ) & a + 0.5 &",

this will be the form used hereafter . \u001c the random matrix @xmath28 is called a `` doubly a comparably big number of time snapshots , so that we may approximately talk about the `` thermodynamical limit , '' @xmath34 on the other hand , it is exactly this limit in which the frv calculus ( see the subsection below for its brief elucidation ) can be applied ; hence , the challenge of de  noising is somewhat counterbalanced by the computationally powerful frv techniques .    on the practical side , any study of a ( real symmetric @xmath36 ) random matrix @xmath37 will most surely include a fundamental question about the average values of its ( real ) eigenvalues .    on the theoretical side , it will most surely include a fundamental question about the average values of its ( real ) eigenvalues .    on the practical side , they are concisely encoded in the `` mean spectral density , '' @xmath38 here the expectation map @xmath39 is understood to be taken w.r.t .    on the practical side , we will always have the probability measure @xmath40 of the random matrix .    on the practical side , we will always have this distribution rotationally ( _ i.e. _ , , with @xmath41 in terms of this latter , @xmath44 resulting from a well  known formula for generalized functions , .    the doubly correlated wishart ensemble @xmath28 ( [ eq : estimatorcdefinition ] ) may be viewed as a product of several random and non  random matrices .    in matrix probability theory , the general problem of multiplying random matrices seems formidable .    in classical probability theory , it can be effectively handled in the special situation when the random terms are independent : then , the exponential map reduces it to the addition problem of independent random numbers , solved by considering the logarithm of the characteristic functions of the respective pdfs , which proves to be additive . in matrix probability theory ,    a crucial insight came from d.  voiculescu and coworkers and r.  speicher  @xcite , who showed how to parallel the commutative construction in the noncommutative world .   in matrix probability theory , it starts with the notion of `` freeness , '' which basically comprises probabilistic independence together with a lack of any directional correlation between two random matrices .    in matrix probability theory , this nontrivial new property happens to be the on the choice of the @xmath35transform as the carrier of the mean spectral information , and the construction of its functional inverse , the @xmath3transform , which essentially multiplies under taking the free product ) resolves the multiplication problem for free random noncommutative objects . its @xmath35transform , , it is more pedagogical to recast ( [ eq : doublycorrelatedwishartensemblethemainequation1 ] ) as an equation for the unknown @xmath35 , @xmath53 it provides a means for computing the mean spectral density of a doubly correlated wishart random matrix once the `` true '' covariance matrices @xmath18 and @xmath20 are given .    in this communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication ,    in the communication , a time span of @xmath4 moments .      in such a setting , this is a simple generalization of the standard univariate weak  stationary moving average @xmath56 . in such a setting , the value of the @xmath10th ( @xmath11 ) random variable at time moment @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) can be expressed as @xmath57 here all the s are iid standard ( mean zero , variance one ) gaussian random numbers ( white noise ) , .       in such a setting , the s are some @xmath58 real constants ;

[ doubletrees ] @xmath144 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath148    let @xmath148 satisfy @xmath149 for @xmath28 and @xmath150 . for every @xmath151 with @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we have @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we have @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath151 . � we denote the resulting graph @xmath151 for @xmath151 and @xmath151 , we have @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we have @xmath151 for @xmath xmath113 , then we recover the result for spherically symmetric trees mentioned previously , that is , @xmath120 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath140    [ constants ] the only difference between this construction , where we connect end vertices to each vertex in @xmath120 , and the one given in @xcite , where one attaches a path to infinity , is in the constant @xmath178 in ( [ differences ] ) .    [ constants ] the only difference between this construction , where we connect end vertices to each vertex in @xmath120 , and the one given in @xmath178 , where one attaches a path to infinity , is in the constant @xmath178 in ( [ differences ] ) .    [ constants ] the only difference between this construction , namely , when one attaches a path to a vertex @xmath153 , by identifying that vertex with the vertex 0 in the graph @xmath133 , then a calculation with difference equations gives that @xmath179 and one replaces the constant @xmath180 in ( [ differences ] ) with the constant @xmath181 .    [ constants ] we mention this fact to make it clear , as sgraphs ] @xmath186 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath192    let @xmath100 satisfy @xmath149 for @xmath193 and @xmath194 . by averaging over spheres , as above , it suffices to consider functions depending only of the distance from @xmath69 .    in particular , if @xmath29 satisfies the conditions above , then , using the identities @xmath196 satisfies @xmath197 for all @xmath113 .     in particular , ( [ sgraphs ] )    in particular , ( [ sgraphs ] )    in particular , ( [ sgraphs ] )    in particular , we claim that , if @xmath196 satisfies @xmath197 for all @xmath113 .     in particular , ( [ sgraphs ] )    in particular , ( [ sgraphs ] )    in particular , ( [ sincrements ] )    in particular , we claim that @xmath199 this follows by induction . for @xmath200    now , we have @xmath201 which implies that @xmath202 vertices on a particular sphere @xmath72 in @xmath120 and this has no effect on the stochastic completeness . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ that is , let @xmath220 , where @xmath220 is obtained by connecting some number of vertices on each sphere @xmath72 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ then , theorem [ sgraphs ] shows that @xmath220 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath221    furthermore , by applying heat kernel comparison theorems , it follows that the heat kernels on @xmath120 and @xmath220 are equal . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ then , it is easy to see that the heat kernel on @xmath220 depends only on the distance from @xmath69 , that is , @xmath222 for all @xmath223 . then , applying theorem 3.11 in @xcite , it follows that @xmath224 for all @xmath223 , where @xmath225 denotes the heat kernel on @xmath220 . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ then , it is easy to see that @xmath220 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath220 is stochastically incomplete if and only if @xmath220 is stochastically incomplete if and only xmath72 than go outwards .      on the other hand , theorem [ doubletrees ] shows that adding only @xmath234 end vertices at @xmath15 does have the effect of trapping the particle .      on the other hand , this contrast can be understood in light of the following model for the diffusion process governed by the heat kernel .      on the other hand , the direction of each jump is chosen randomly with probabilities as in the case of the simple random walk on the graph ; however , the holding time of the particle at a vertex is a random variable whose exponential distribution depends on the valence of the vertex . specifically , if the particle undergoing the diffusion is at a vertex @xmath15 at time @xmath235 , then it will jump , after a random time , to one of the neighbors of @xmath15 with probability @xmath236 . furthermore , the probability that it has not moved from the vertex @xmath15 at time @xmath237 is @xmath238 .      see @xcite for more details on this model of the diffusion process .      therefore , in the example above , although the particle will most likely jump to another vertex on the same sphere , the factorial valence xmath247 which is complete .  perspect furthermore , given any graph , not necessarily spherically symmetric , not necessarily spherically symmetric , whose spheres satisfy ( [ spheregraphs ] ) for some vertex @xmath69 , one can create a spherically symmetric stochastically incomplete graph by connecting all vertices in @xmath72 to all vertices in @xmath240 for @xmath248 .  perspect furthermore , this operation , where we add edges but do not change the vertex set to obtain a stochastically incomplete graph from a complete one , is complementary to the procedure described in section [ subgraphs section ] , where we added vertices and edges to create a complete graph from an incomplete one . on the other hand , in example [ modelgraphsex ]  perspect we discussed how adding edges along the same sphere has no effect on stochastic completeness .  perspect one can also extend our techniques to the case of the weighted laplacian as found in @xcite and , as a special case , in @xcite .  perspect furthermore , consider the weighted graph @xmath249 with vertex set @xmath250 , edge set @xmath251 , and edge weights @xmath252 . in a position to prove the analogous statements for graphs . not apply in our case . in particular , � in example [ completionex ] the graphs @xmath120 and @xmath144 are roughly isometric but @xmath120 is stochastically incomplete while @xmath144 is stochastically complete . � in particular , as mentioned previously , grigoryan s volume criterion ( [ gri ] ) was extended to the more general setting of dirichlet spaces by sturm @xcite . � in particular , _ metric _ or _ quantum _ graphs are covered by this extension . � therefore , we have shown that , with respect to volume growth , solutions of the heat equation behave differently on quantum and discrete graphs . � this is also the case for solutions of the wave equation where , in the quantum setting , as on manifolds , solutions of the wave equation have finite propagation speed , in contrast to the case of discrete graphs . � see @xcite for details . � i would like to thank many people with whom i ve had helpful and inspiring discussions while working on the material in this article . � in particular , i would like to thank jzef dodziuk , pedro freitas , sebastian haeseler , matthias",

TextColor , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm    next , we show how the deepcore sensitivity on dm annihilation cross section varies with the chosen cone half - angle and threshold energy for nfw dm density profile . here � we take @xmath10 channel for illustration . � 3 shows the required dm annihilation cross section @xmath149 for a @xmath132 detection in five years for different cone half - angle @xmath159 . � it is seen that the choosing @xmath136 .     in fact , one expects the situation turns opposite for @xmath26 approaching to the threshold energy .     in fact , for @xmath169 gev , one can see that the sensitivity on dm annihilation cross section obtained with @xmath136 is always better than that obtained with @xmath170 .     in addition , we note that the deepcore sensitivities on other annihilation channels have similar cone half - angle and threshold energy dependencies . from the above discussions , we observe that , in contrast to the main concern of this article , raising the threshold energy for probing dm annihilation with track events increases sensitivity for probing heavier dm .    in fact , as the threshold energy approaches to @xmath171 gev , one enters into the operative energy range of the full icecube array such that the effective volume of the detector increases more rapidly with the threshold energy than the case with deepcore detector alone  @xcite .    in fact , we observe that the same situation holds for probing dm annihilation with track events .     for einasto  @xmath149 , nfw  @xcite , isothermal  @xciteand also present in fig . � 4 the expected deepcore sensitivities for different @xmath159 with isothermal dm density profile . � because there is a core in the central dm density distribution of isothermal profile , we refer to this class of profile as the cored profile . � we note that the sensitivity to dm annihilation cross section with isothermal profile improves as @xmath159 increases from @xmath160 to @xmath162 while the sensitivity with einasto profile behaves oppositely . � this is because that the dm density distribution of isothermal profile maintains flat for a much longer distance from the gc as compared to the cusped profile . � however , as @xmath159 increases further , the deepcore sensitivity to dm annihilation cross section becomes poorer even for isothermal profile since the factor @xmath172 is proportional to the square of dm density . � this is because that the deepcore sensitivities to dm annihilation cross section with isothermal profile are poorer than those with cusped profiles for the same @xmath159 . � however , as @xmath159 increases further , the deepcore sensitivity to dm annihilation cross section becomes poorer even for isothermal profile by track events . @@@@@@@@ we like to point out that the comparison between cascade and track events in fig . @@@@@@@@ 5 is based upon the current angular resolution of icecube detector . @@@@@@@@ if the angular resolution for cascade events is improved in the future , the advantage of measuring cascade events would be even more significant as one can see from fig . @@@@@@@@ the dot - dot - dashed line is the @xmath173 upper bound on annihilation cross section for low - mass wimp  @xcite obtained by wmap7 data . @@@@@@@@ the dot - dot - dashed line is the cmb constraint obtained by using wmap7 + act data at @xmath174 c.l . @@@@@@@@ the dot - dot - dashed line is the dsphs constraint at @xmath174 c.l . @@@@@@@@ the dot - dot - dashed line is the constraint due to fermi - lat observations on the region @xmath175 plus a @xmath176 square region centered at gc , assuming the nfw profile  @xcite . @@@@@@@@ the thick and thin solid lines are the expected @xmath132 sensitivities of deepcore detector with @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",sc 132 sensitivities on @xmath10 annihilation cross section by the deepcore detector with @xmath137 and @xmath158 are plotted for comparison . In ref .   , however , the deepcore sensitivity is comparable to the cmb constraint with @xmath158 .     , thus it is stronger than the expected deepcore sensitivity with @xmath137 in this dm mass range .     as a function of @xmath26 such that the dm annihilation cross section could be velocity dependent .     as a function of @xmath26 hence , a model dependent extrapolation on dm annihilation cross section might be required to compare the constraint on @xmath183 at redshift @xmath182 to that at the present day universe @xcite .    , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm     as a function of @xmath26 such that the neutrino signature from dm decays     can be detected at the @xmath132 significance in five years for cascade events . track and cascade events.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] 0.5 cm    we also present fermi - lat s dsphs constraint and galactic gamma ray constraint on @xmath155 annihilation cross section in fig .  6 and 7 . by comparing figs .  6 and 7  , we note that fermi - lat data gives more stringent constraint on @xmath155 mode than its constraint on @xmath10 mode .     we note that this is in contrast to the deepcore case as one can see from fig .  2 .    we note that while the neutrino spectrum through @xmath10 is harder than that through @xmath155 , the gamma ray spectra through the above annihilations behave differently .     we note that the gamma ray spectrum from @xmath155 dominates over that from @xmath10 for most of the range of @xmath189  @xcite . the expected @xmath132 sensitivity on @xmath155 channel by the deepcore detector with @xmath158  @xmath155 is also shown in fig .  2 .    and the expected deepcore sensitivity on this channel math186 channel requires the lowest decay rate ( longest decay time ) to avoid a @xmath132 detection significance in five years of deepcore data taking .  perspect we note that the energy - dependent effective volume @xmath140  @xcite downgrades the sensitivity to @xmath192 decay time by roughly a factor of 1.5 at @xmath193 gev , which corresponds to @xmath194 gev .  perspect however , the sensitivity to @xmath192 obtained with @xmath140 is better than that presented in fig .  8 for @xmath195 gev , which corresponds to @xmath196 gev . for @xmath191 mode ,  perspect the sensitivity at @xmath193 gev is lower by a factor of @xmath26 by applying @xmath140 , since such a @xmath26 corresponds to lowest possible neutrino energy @xmath142 gev .  perspect however , @xmath140 shall enhance the sensitivity for @xmath196 gev , which corresponds to @xmath196 gev , assuming @xmath196 gev .  perspect the correction factor for @xmath191 mode ,  perspect the sensitivity at @xmath193 gev is lower by a factor math205 gives rise to the highest sensitivity on dm decay time for @xmath170 .     in fig .  11 , we note that the sensitivity on dm decay time is improved by lowering @xmath166 from @xmath167 gev to @xmath168 gev for @xmath206 gev .     in fig .  11 , we note that it is of interest to compare sensitivities on dm decay time given by cascade events and track events . in fig .   in fig .  10 , one can see that cascade events provide better sensitivity on dm decay time than that given by track events for the same threshold energy @xmath207 and @xmath159 . in the same figure    in fig .  11 , we also show the sensitivity given by track events for @xmath208 .    in fig .  11 , we note that such a @xmath209 renders the best sensitivity for track events .    in fig .  11 , we note that the sensitivity on dm decay time is improved by lowering the threshold energy of @xmath208 .    in fig .  11 , we present decay time lower limits for @xmath191 @xmath140  @xcite . on the other hand , � if dm decays predominantly to @xmath211 , the expected deepcore sensitivity is much poorer than the constraint from fermi - lat data . � in this paper , we have evaluated sensitivities of icecube deepcore detector to neutrino cascade events induced by dm annihilations and decays in galactic halo . � we focus on the scenario of small dm mass and the threshold energy for the cascade events is taken to be @xmath168 gev . � the event rate of background atmospheric neutrinos is calculated with @xmath212 oscillations taken into account for neutrino energies less than @xmath213 gev . � the signal event rate is calculated by taking nfw profile for dm density distribution in the galactic halo . among all dm annihilation and decay channels , � the annihilation mode @xmath7 and the decay mode @xmath192 provide the best search sensitivity , while the search sensitivity provided by the annihilation mode @xmath155 and the decay mode @xmath214 is the poorest . � it is important to compare the expected sensitivities of deepcore detector to dm annihilation cross section and i - lat constraint based upon gamma - ray data from the galactic halo . from the above comparisons , � there remain slight possibilities to observe dm induced neutrino signature from the galactic halo provided dm annihilates or decays predominantly into leptons . � it should be noted that fermi - lat and cmb data does not directly set limits on @xmath7 or @xmath192 modes with monochromatic neutrinos . there � there exist models @xcite in which @xmath7 and @xmath192 are dominant annihilation and decay modes , respectively . in the annihilation case � @xcite for example , the dm candidate can be the lightest right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino in a @xmath215 extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . � each rh sneutrinos annihilate into a pair of rh neutrinos . � each of these rh neutrinos then decays into ordinary left - handed ( lh ) neutrino and a neutral higgs boson while the decay of rh neutrino into charged final states @xmath216 is typically forbidden in such a model . in the case � that the mass difference in this regard , it is interesting to see if a detector array in the northern hemisphere with the size of deepcore detector has a significantly better sensitivity than the current deepcore detector surrounded by icecube strings .     in this regard , we note that since the latter also has a good veto capability , the former can gain only in the effective volume expected to be enhanced by the muon range .     in this regard , we note that the deepcore array aims at detecting neutrinos in the energy range @xmath218 .     in this regard , we note that muons induced by muon neutrinos in this energy range only travel around @xmath167 m for @xmath219 gev and @xmath220 m for @xmath221 gev .     in this regard , we note that this does not significantly enhance the detector s effective volume in most cases since the height of the deepcore detector is already around @xmath222 m. therefore , given the existence of icecube detector augmented by deepcore in the south pole , it is clear that neutrino telescopes in the northern hemisphere only have advantages in detecting neutrino signature from heavier dm . in this regard the grant from research and development office , national chiao -

Notwithstanding where we detect sio ( j=4 - 3 ) we suggest there is ongoing outflow activity .  Notwithstanding we present the column density of sio towards each source in table [ tab : sio_prop ] .  Notwithstanding we can divide this value by the abundance of sio with respect to h@xmath17 in order to determine the column density of shocked gas in each region .  Notwithstanding these values are also presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] .  Notwithstanding we used the same methods as described in paper 1 to calculate the abundance of sio towards g10.6 and we have assumed a constant sio abundance across each map .  Notwithstanding we note that the sio column densities listed in paper 1 are over estimated by a factor of 3.8 , and thus the logarithmic sio abundances listed in that paper are corrected in table [ tab : sio_prop ] .  Notwithstanding we have adopted a new distance for g10.47 , we have adopted a new distance for g10.47 , we have had in addition to modify our original abundance estimate from paper 1 .  Notwithstanding the cs column density quoted in @xcite appears presented in @xcite     , we suggest shock velocities of 20 - 22 km s@xmath2 , and ambient densities of @xmath18 @xmath19 .    the ambient densities suggested here are consistent with those of @xcite who determined densities and cs column densities for these regions using large velocity gradient models . for each of our sources ,     we adopt a shock velocity of @xmath20 km s@xmath2 .     because we have mapped the sio emission towards seven sources , we can determine the radius of the region in which sio is being emitted ( r@xmath21 ) .     the method used to determine the deconvolved source size was described in section [ sec : observations ] , and the radius of the emitting region is presented in table [ tab : sio_prop ] . from this radius and the shock velocity determined above , we can constrain the ages of our outflows from simple kinematic arguments . these approximate outflow     the ages are presented in table [ tab : hco_prop ] and are used later to constrain the amount of infalling material .    in order for the outflow shocks to reach their observed sizes � these thermal energies are of approximately the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energies calculated for the co outflows in a number of massive star forming regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; similarly the wind luminosities are comparable to the luminosities of their hii regions ( see for instance * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ) ; and many authors suggest that an asymmetric self absorbed line profile of an optically thick line tracer in which the blue emission peak is brighter than the red , and the optically thin tracer has a single line peak , can be indicative of infall ( i.e. * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � * ; * ? ? ? � , our optically thick line is hco@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) and the optically thin isotopologue is h@xmath1co@xmath0 ( j=4 - 3 ) .    from paper 1 � , we expected to observe infall signatures in g10.47 and g19.61 .    from paper 1 .5 and 4.1 kpc .    the infall velocities were calculated for each self absorbed hco@xmath0 spectrum towards g10.47 , g10.6 , g19.61 , and g20.08 using the models of @xcite in the same way as described in paper 1 . from our rms uncertainties in line temperatures and the spectral resolution of our observations , we determined the uncertainties associated with our derived infall velocities .    we used these uncertainties to limit the regions in which we claim infall detections . only if the derived infall velocity is more than three times our uncertainty for that spectrum do we claim to detect infall in that pixel . towards g19.61 and g20.08 , robust detections were made in one and three pixels ( respectively ) suggesting that the infall in both of these sources is unresolved . towards g10.47 and g10.6 ( both at approximately 6 kpc ) , robust infall detections were made in seven nyquist sampled pixels per map , suggesting that the large scale infall in these regions is extended .    along the northern  , blue shifted , outflow lobe in g10.47 , the hco@xmath0 taking the mean of the infall velocities determined for each position in each map using the models of @xcite .    using the method of averaging the infall velocities for each region , we determined the infall velocities for each region using the models of @xcite .    using the method of averaging the infall velocities for each region , we determined the infall velocities for each region using the method of @xcite .    using the method of averaging the infall velocities for each region , we determined the infall velocities for each region .    using the latter method resulted in unreasonably high infall rates ( i.e. 5 km s@xmath2 in g10.47 ) , which give very large mass infall rates ( 0.22 m@xmath33 yr@xmath2 ) and total infall masses ( @xmath34 m@xmath33 ) assuming constant infall rates over the lifetime of the outflow . averaging the spectra and then determining the infall velocity increased the infall velocity by increasing the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line . since the infall velocity varies as the fwhm squared ( see equation 9 of * ? ? is interesting to note that the infall and outflow signatures in g19.61 are both unresolved , and the signatures in g20.08 are both marginally resolved .       this comparison suggests that the shocked region , as traced by sio , may have a similar physical size as the infall regions in these smaller sources . towards g10.6 and g10.47 , the regions over which we have robustly detected extended infall , our deconvolved sio emitting regions also appear to be on the same approximate spatial scales .           when comparing infall mass and outflow mass , we note that our infall masses are lower than our outflow masses .         this is contrary to the results of @xcite ; however , their ratio was calculated for the protostellar jet , not the entrained molecular outflow .           this comparison to @xcite suggests that more of the ambient mass is entrained into the large scale molecular outflow ( produced by a protostellar jet ) than falls in onto the forming stars ( i.e. * ? ? ? an extremely large outflow is instead the super - position of a number of clouds along the line of sight .    examining the spectra of our hco@xmath0 map , however , based on the arguments presented below , we suggest that the gas kinematics and morphology are due to a large outflow .    examining the spectra of our hco@xmath0 map , we note that while the hco@xmath0 emission is extended , it is not present in all pixels , suggesting that we have captured all of the emission in this velocity range .    examining the spectra of our hco@xmath0 map , the grayscale in figure [ fig : averaged_spectra ] shows the hco@xmath0 line profiles averaged over the blue and red shifted emission regions as well as the hco@xmath0 and h@xmath1co@xmath0 line profiles averaged over the central nine pixels of our map .    examining the spectra of our hco@xmath0 map , we note that the red and blue spectra , while having very little overlap between their profiles , do both fit within the width of the source center line profile . transition from blue to red along the source would be more likely to be observed in one source with a velocity gradient than three separate sources with discontinuous cloud boundaries . the second moment map of this region ( contours in figure [ fig : g1047_mom1 ] ) suggest that the largest velocity dispersion is towards the center , and continuously decreases towards the emission edges ( outflow lobe ends ) , suggesting that most of the mass is centrally concentrated . � while we favor the outflow interpretation of this morphology , higher resolution , large scale observations of this source are necessary in order to resolve this ambiguity . � this region contains four individual uchii regions and what is likely a large scale outflow with a collimation factor ( @xmath42 ) of approximately 1.5 , which may be even more highly collimated at higher resolution . � while we favor the outflow interpretation of this morphology , we favor the outflow interpretation of this morphology , higher resolution , large scale observations of this source are necessary in order to resolve this ambiguity . � this region contains four individual uchii regions and what is likely a large scale outflow with a collimation factor ( @xmath42 ) of approximately 1.5 , which may be even more highly on infall velocities and shown that the lack of infall signatures in some sources is not due to the signature being beam diluted out of observability at large distances .    we have found that one of our sources which was previously not thought to have an infall signature ( g20.08 ) in fact does appear to have large scale infall motions .    this discovery suggests that more accurate infall results are possible with maps of massive star forming environments than with single pointing observations .     returning to the results of paper 1 , we determined that seven out of the 14 sources with ongoing outflow signatures had infall signatures as well .    we have found that these numbers can now be revised to eight out of 15 outflow sources with infall signatures when g10.6 is added to the source list .    we have also found that we have found that approximately half of the sources with ongoing outflows have infall signatures which we take to trace accretion .    we have also found that, because our sources were selected based on the presence of hii regions , ongoing infall suggests that there is a phase of massive star formation in which the star is still actively accreting , but is also burning hydrogen brightly enough to ionize its surroundings of the emitting region , the mass of shocked gas and how much energy is required to shock the gas surrounding a massive protostar . + k3 -

      "generated": "servations of the cmb , supernovae , lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations have led to the cosmological standard model which requires an accelerated expansion of the late universe , driven by dark energy but despite many years of research its origin has not yet been identified .    in the cosmological standard model , there are two major explanations for the origin and properties of dark energy .    in the cosmological standard model , the first solution consists of introducing a cosmological constant @xmath0 with a constant energy density causing an effective repulsive force between cosmological objects at large distances . from the particle physics perspective the cosmological constant could correspond to the vacuum energy density .    in the cosmological standard model , the theoretical expectations for the vacuum energy density caused by fluctuating quantum fields , however , exceeds the observational bounds on @xmath0 by up to 120 orders of magnitude .    in the cosmological standard model , this discrepancy remains for more almost a century one of the most challenging puzzles in physics , @xcite .    in the cosmological standard model , alternatively , the acceleration of the universe can be explained by introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom , either by xmath3 , one recovers general relativity ( gr ) through the vainshtein mechanism : the basic idea is to decouple the additional modes from the gravitational dynamics via nonlinear interactions of the helicity-0 mode of the graviton , @xcite . as a result , at the vicinity of matter , the non - linear interaction for the helicity-0 mode become large and hence suppresses its coupling to matter . � this decoupling of the nonlinear helicity-0 mode is manifest in the limit where @xmath4 and @xmath5 while the strong coupling scale @xmath6 is kept fixed . � this limit enables a linear treatment of the usual helicity-2 mode of gravity while the helicity-0 mode @xmath7 is described non - linearly , which is the so - called decoupling limit . � one of the successes of the dgp model is the existence of a self - accelerating solution , where the acceleration of the universe is sourced by the graviton own degrees of freedom ( more precisely its helicity-0 mode ) . � this limit enables a linear treatment of the usual helicity-2 mode of gravity while the helicity-0 mode @xmath7 is described around compact sources @xcite , k - mouflage @xcite , kinetic gravity braiding @xcite , etc ... .     furthermore , there has been some effort in generalizing the galileon to a non - flat background .     the first attempt was then to covariantize directly the decoupling limit and to study its resulting cosmology @xcite .     in particular it was shown in @xcite that the naive covariantization would yield ghost - like terms at the level of equation of motion but a given unique nonminimal coupling between @xmath7 and the curvature can remove these terms resulting in second order of equations of motion @xcite , which are also consistent with a higher - dimensional construction @xcite . in this paper , we will pursue the same strategy when constructing our proxy theory .     the outcome of this kind of covariantization method was explored further in @xcite .     while this covariantization is ghost - free , the galileon symmetry is broken explicitly in curved backgrounds .     only recently there has been a successful generalization to the ( anti- ) de sitter background and ultimately to maximally symmetric backgrounds where it has been discovered that the de sitter gal constant negative pressure density . in the decoupling limit � , the expansion history of the universe in this self - accelerating branch was found to be indistinguishable from @xmath0cdm , @xcite . � while the self - accelerating solutions in the above models yield viable expansion histories including late - time acceleration , they do not address the cosmological constant problem , the giant mismatch between the theoretically computed high energy density of the vacuum and the low observed value . � a possible answer comes from the idea of degravitation , which asserts that the energy density could be as large as the theoretically expected value , but would not bear a large effect on the geometry . � technically , gravity is less strong on large scales ( ir - limit ) and could act as a high - pass filter suppressing the gravitational effect of a potentially large vacuum energy . since such modifications of gravity in the ir naturally arise in models of massive gravity , they logically provide a possible mechanism to degravitate the vacuum energy density , @xcite , which was observed in bi - galileon models @xcite as well as in the decoupling limit of massive gravity , @xcite . � analogously , the dgp braneworld model can be extended to higher dimensions . at early times , � the enhancement of clustering is restrained since the galileon self - interactions are the dominant ones suppressing their energy density relative to that of matter or radiation . � once the matter density has dropped sufficiently , the galileon become an important contribution to the dark sector of the universe driving cosmic expansion . � the paper is organized as follows : we start in section [ sec : mg1 ] with a summary of the non - linear theory of massive gravity @xcite which we use for constructing our proxy theory , where we discuss the successful implementation of ghost - free massive gravity in the decoupling limit . � we then move to our proxy theory in section [ sec : proxy ] where we first give some motivations on why we use a proxy theory rather than the exact non - linear theory . � we then work out the consequences of this covariantization for cosmology and specifically for late - time acceleration in section [ sec : sa ] where we study also the stability conditions and the reason why a degravitating solution can not be constructed in our covariantized theory . � we then move onto more general cosmology in section [ sec : cosmology ] and follow the helicity-0 mode contribution to the universe throughout that the graviton potential could be built in such way as to remove any higher derivative term in the equations of motion , and obtain a galileon - type of action for the additional helicity-0 mode . to review this , � let us start with a graviton of mass @xmath2 described by l=(r - u(g , h))[eq : full ] with the potential @xmath16 , where the tensor @xmath17 is constructed in terms of the metric @xmath18 and the four fields @xmath19 by @xmath20 . � we can then split the fields into helicity-1 and -0 contributions , but the helicity-1 mode decouples in the decoupling limit and can be consistently set to zero . � we therefore focus on the helicity-0 mode @xmath7 and write @xmath21 such that @xmath22 . defining the quantity @xmath23 the most generic potential that bears no ghosts in the decoupling limit is u(g , h)=-4@xmath24[eq : fullu ] where @xmath25 are two free parameters and _ 2&=&[]^2-[^2 ] + _ xmath3 , while keeping the strong coupling scale @xmath30 fixed , the above lagrangian reduces to the more compact expression l=-12h^e^_h_+h^x^(1)_+h^x^(2)_+h^x^(3)_+h^x^(4)_+h^t_[eq : massivegravity ] where @xmath31 stands for the helicity-2 mode canonically normalized , @xmath32 is the lichnerowicz operator , the coefficients @xmath33 are related to the free parameters @xmath25 and @xmath34 denote the interactions with the helicity-0 mode @xcite x^(1 ) _ & = & g_- _ [ eq : x1 ] + x^(2 ) _ & = & ^2_-_-12([^2]-[]^2)g _ [ eq : x1 ] + x^(3 ) _ & = & 6 ^ 3_-6[]^2_+3([]^2-[^2])_-g_([]^3 -

g^-l^(__+r^___)=0,[eq : pij ] where we have used the fact that d_d_d_l^&=&-r^__l^=14 ^l_gb with @xmath51 . in the rest of this paper \u001c , we study the resulting cosmology in this proxy theory , starting with the existence of self - accelerating solutions . \u001c in what follows , we focus on the cosmology of the covariantized theory ( [ eq : totalaction ] , [ eq : covjor ] , [ eq : covjor ] ) , and focus for that on a frw background with scale factor @xmath52 and hubble parameter @xmath53 . the resulting effective energy density and pressure for the field @xmath7 are then ^&=&(6h+6h^2-h^2 ^ 2-h^3 ^ 3)[eq : effdens ] + p^&=&3 ( [ eq : modfrid ] ) sets the hubble constant of the self - accelerated solution . also worth pointing out that the self - accelerating solution by itself does not propagate any superluminal mode , since @xmath76 . � we emphasize as well that the constant @xmath77 solution is a dynamical attractor . � for this we just consider time dependent perturbations @xmath78 which is a special case of fulfilling the same stability conditions . � the equation of motion for perturbations simplifies to _ t(a^3 ) = 0 the solution for @xmath79 is given by ( t)~a^-3 . � thus , these perturbations @xmath80 redshift away exponentially compared to the @xmath81 self - accelerating solution . � therefore , the self - accelerating solution is an attractor . � more interestingly , one can wonder whether degravitation can be exhibited in these class of solutions . � if one take @xmath82 and @xmath83 , it is straightforward to see that we obtain @xmath84 , so the field has absolutely no effect and can not help the background to degravitate . � the situation is however different when setting @xmath85 , which was possible in the decoupling limit . in this proxy theory  end the cosmological analysis by looking at the evolution of matter density perturbations . � the density perturbations follow the evolution _ � m+2h_m= where @xmath41 is the newtonian potential . � the effects of @xmath7 are all encoded in its contribution to the poisson equation . � consider perturbations of @xmath7 around its cosmological background solution @xmath101 . � @xmath102 gives a contribution to the newtonian potential of the form @xmath103 . in the newtonian approximation � we have @xmath104 . � the equation of motion for the scalar field in first order in @xmath102 is -g^ d_d_- l_(4_0^ d^d^+2r^__0^)=r which is equivalent to ( neglecting @xmath105 ) = r and last but not least we need the trace of einstein equation , ( [ eq.:einstein]-[eq : t3 ] ) . perturbing the trace to first order � the equation of motion for the scalar field in first order in @xmath102 is -g^ d_d cosmology and the structure formation of our proxy theory in the jordan frame , the natural question is whether we would expect similar results in a different frame . instead of covariantizing our lagrangian in the jordan frame ,  we use the first mixed term @xmath37 such that it is on an equal footing to go to the einstein frame where the ricci scalar is not multiplied by the scalar field @xmath7 and covariantize the theory at that stage .  we use the second mixed term @xmath37 such that it is on an equal footing to go to the einstein frame where the ricci scalar is not multiplied by the scalar field @xmath7 and covariantize the theory at that stage .   we use the second mixed term @xmath37 such that the lagrangian takes the following form l=-12h^e^_h_+h^x^(1)_+h^x^(2)_+h^x^(3)_+h^x^(3)_+h^t _ now , when we do the following change of variables h_=|h_+_[eq : ef1 ] we can diagonal field equations � then take the form & & ^2h^2=3a_2 ^ 3q^2 + 10a_3 ^ 3q^3 - 12q^2 + 3a_2q^3 + 15a_3q^4 + & & ^3(-1 + 3q(a_2 + 4a_3q))+2(a_2 + 3a_3q)h^2=0[eq : frein ] when comparing the above friedmann and the field equations with the one we had in the jordan frame , we see significant differences coming from the extra terms which were not there in the jordan frame . � these terms yield friedmann and field equations proportional to @xmath119 and @xmath120 which are more difficult to solve . � + for fairness , we should compare both actions in the same frame . � we do so by performing a conformal transformation on the action : g_=^2 g _ ^2=(1- ) . for simplicity � we consider the case for which @xmath121 , so under this conformal transformation the covariantized action becomes _ j= ^2r-32 ^ -4()^2 appreciable to freeze out the field fluctuations .    a number of screening mechanisms have been devised such as the chameleon and symmetron mechanisms .     contrary to those the success of the vainshtein mechanism does not rely on some specific potential but instead on derivative interactions , which cause the helicity-0 mode to become decoupled from matter and light on short distances , which nevertheless could have observational signatures on larger scales in cosmic structure formation .     a further benefit of the vainshtein mechanism would be a natural solution to the problem that the matter density and the cosmological constant are of similar magnitudes today .    the cosmological application of the vainshtein mechanism works such that at early times , the galileon interactions are dominated by self - interaction , which suppresses their energy density relative to that of matter or radiation . if the matter density has decreased sufficiently by cosmic expansion , the galileon constitutes an important contribution to the energy density of the universe and drives cosmic expansion .    although the precise cosmology of the theory of massive gravity proposed in @xcite has not been derived , most models of massive gravity give rise to alterations of the hubble function similar to d clusters of galaxies .      naturally , these changes are degenerate with a different choice of cosmological parameters and with introducing non - gaussian initial conditions , which would be very interesting to quantify .      recent discrepancies of @xmath0cdm with observational data on large scales include the number of very massive clusters , the strong lensing cross section , anomalous multipole moments of the cmb , the axis of evil , and large peculiar velocities .      it is beyond the scope of this paper to address these issues using massive gravity , but we propose how to proceed from constructing a massive gravity theory to providing observationally testable quantities . from our point of view      it is advisable to focus on probes of large scales , due to difficulties related to nonlinear structure formation and the influence of baryons on small scales .      natural questions concern the homogeneous dynamics of the universe , the formation of structures and the shape of geodesics of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles .      basically , using our proxy theory one should be able to make predictions concerning these four issues and the combination of the four should give insight into the nature of the gravitational sector .      it is advisable to focus on probes of large scales , ; g.  r.  dvali and g.  gabadadze , phys .   d * 63 * , 065007 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : hep -

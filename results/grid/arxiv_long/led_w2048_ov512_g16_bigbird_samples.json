gordon , as well as feynman and gorkov , on dirac s equation of motion @xcite . since then , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the relativistic dynamics of particles , both in classical and quantum mechanics , with particular emphasis on the role played by spinors , which are particles that have spin , charge , or orbital angular momentum ( see , e.g.  we show that the scalar potential @xmath0 of the relativistic schrdinger equation for fermions has a bound - state solution when the fermion rest energy is smaller than the sum of the scalar and vector potentials , which is the case in the nonrelativistic limit .<n> the bound state is characterized by the sign of the energy difference between the two components of the potential , and is stable with respect to small perturbations . <n> relativistic mean - field models , like the klein - gordon model , are known to have a bound state when the mass of the particle goes to zero compared with the binding energy of the corresponding antiparticle @xcite-@xcite . in this case<n> , the potentials have a well - defined energy dependence , so that the binding energies of the two particles are the same , provided they are close to each other . as a consequence ,<n> there is no bound state for any particle , no matter how small it is , when its binding energy is comparable to the rest energy of its antiparticle . on the other hand , _<n> e.g. _ , in the case of nuclei , there is the single - particle spectrum of the relativistic harmonic oscillator in three spatial dimensions is investigated .<n> it is shown that the spectrum is completely independent of the sign of the pseudoscalar potential , except for the case when it is negative , in which case the spectrum consists of positive - energy states only . in this case<n> the chiral transformation connects these states with the negative - energy continuum states , so that klein s paradox does not come into play . as far as the relations between the spectra of systems with @xmath0 and @xcite<n> are concerned , one can note that the general properties of the charge -

dimensional equation of motion for a particle moving in a periodic potential .<n> this equation is solved exactly for the case of a square potential , and the results are compared with those for the harmonic oscillator . <n> one of the most important problems in the theory of quantum many - body systems is the identification of the ground state of the system . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the properties of the solutions of the schrdinger equation @xcite , which describes the motion of a particle in a potential with the form of a dirac delta - function potential @xmath0 . for a system of two particles<n> this is equivalent to the problem of two coupled oscillators , one of which is the harmonic - oscillator and the other is the quantum dirac oscillator ( qd oscillator ) , see eqs .

      "generated": "we study the influence of medium effects on the gross structure of non - rotating hybrid stars .<n> in particular , we investigate the possibility of a deconfined strange quark matter ( sqm ) phase in the core of the star . in the framework of the effective mass bag model including medium effects ,<n> we construct the phase diagram of hybrid stars and find that the sqm phase is energetically less favorable than the pure hadronic matter phase . we study the properties of hybrid stars consisting of deconfined quark matter and hadronic matter .<n> such stars are expected to form in dense nuclear matter as well as in neutron stars . in order to describe the hadronic phase , we use an equation of state ( eos ) calculated in the framework of the nonlinear walecka model including nucleons , hyperons , electrons , muons and @xmath0 mesons . for the quark phase<n> we use a bag constant which describes a quasi particle ( qp ) and a running coupling constant , which describes the behavior of asymptotic freedom . <n> hybrid stars are the result of the merger of two compact objects , one of them being a neutron star ( ns ) with a mass of a few solar masses @xcite , the other being a compact star with mass of order of a billion solar masses ( cm ) @x<n> . the ns / cm ratio depends on the mass of the star , on the chemical potential of the mixture of the two components and on the age of the stars , e.g. , it is proportional to the mass - radius ( mr ) relation of we investigate the effect of medium effects on the structure of quark stars .<n> in particular , we calculate the mass - radius relations for hybrid stars which possess a mixed phase ( hp ) and a pure quark phase ( qp ) over a finite region inside the star . in order to construct the phase transition ,<n> we write down the gibbs condition for the equilibrium between qp and hp . to describe the qp including @xmath0 quarks<n> , it is sufficient to use the fermion interaction in the wick rotation scheme . for low and high energy densities , the equilibrium phase between hp and qp<n> is given by the pure hp equation of state ( eos ) while the eos of the pure qp is given in the form of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation with a density dependent running coupling . from the tov equation<n> we obtain an eos for the hybrid star which is in good agreement with the one obtained from a first - order phase transition in the sense of glendenning @xcite . <n> phase transitions ( mps ) are one of the most important concepts in theoretical physics , occurring between we study the effect of medium modifications of the equation of state ( eos ) of quark matter on the properties of hadronic stars .<n> in particular , we focus on the influence of the coupling constant @xmath0 on the onset of hyperons and on the structure of stars possessing a quark - gluon plasma ( qp ) or a hadronic core . we find that the transition density between a pure hadronic phase and a qp phase is only slightly affected by increasing the coupling strength , but that the critical central energy density of the star is significantly reduced . <n> stars are the most obvious manifestation of a phase transition in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . in general ,<n> the phase transition is characterized by a change in the density of matter , i.e. a decrease in the central density of a star , and a corresponding increase in the energy density in the transition region ( the so - called transition density ) . for a star to possess a core it should also possess a central density which is larger than the corresponding density of hadrons , e.g. a hadron - quark ( hp ) star . the eos of we investigate the properties of non - rotating hybrid stars composed of quark matter and hadronic matter .<n> we find that such stars possess a pure quark phase at small radii , a mixed phase at larger radii and a pure hadronic phase at large radii . inside such stars<n> a quark - gluon plasma is present in the center of the star , while a hadron - quark ( mc ) transition takes place at a radius of about @xmath0 km . <n> we have recently shown @xcite , that a hybrid star composed of pure strange quark and hadron matter ( hp ) can exist in a wide range of the qcd phase diagram . in this paper<n> , we show that such a star can also exist as a pure qp star ( qc ) , if we take into account medium effects on the equation of state ( eos ) of the hadronic part of the hybrid star . using the effective mass bag model for the description of the medium effects in the eos of the pure hadron star<n> we show how such hybrid stars can be produced in the dense interior of a compact object , where the density is sufficiently high to allow for the existence we have investigated the gross structure of non - rotating pure strange quark matter and hybrid stars using the effective mass bag model . we found that medium effects described by this model and parameterized by the strong coupling constant @xmath0 reduce the extent of a pure quarkmatter phase in the interior of a hybrid star significantly in favor of a mixed phase .<n> our findings support the importance of the investigation of the complex structure of mixed phases . <n> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition is expected to occur in the early stage of the evolution of a neutron star ( ns ) into a massive ( a@xmath1 ) star @xcite . in order to understand the properties of the qgp phase transition ,<n> it is important to investigate the phase diagram of qgp in the phase space , defined by the temperature of the transition and the baryon number density . at the same time , it is also important to understand how qgp is modified by the presence of matter in the environment of the ns star . to this end<n> , one can investigate the equation of state ( eos ) of quark and hadronic matter by solving the schrdinger equation",

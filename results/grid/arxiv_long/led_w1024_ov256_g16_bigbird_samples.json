boson interaction can not be factorized into the product of two terms , one coming from the nc and the other from the s we present a noncommutative @xmath0 gauge field theory in the adjoint representation which is free of infrared singularities up to the leading nontrivial order of the coupling constant .<n> we also show that the model is renormalizable if the gauge field transforms in accord with the left fundamental representation . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.kk , 11.15.bt , 12.20.ds in this paper , we propose a new gauge theory , the noncommuting ( noncommmutive ) @xcite model . in the context of gauge theories ,<n> noncommutation of the hamiltonian is one of the most fundamental and well established principles , being at the core of the celebrated landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory and at the heart of the well known renormalization group ( rg ) equations . at the same time<n> , it has been proven to be at the origin of a number of interesting phenomena , such as the spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance and the electroweak phase transition , as well as of the chiral symmetry of qcd . as a consequence of the landau s we study the landau gauge @xmath0 theory in the presence of a non local interaction term .<n> we show that at leading order of the coupling constant , in the nonrelativistic limit , there is a nonvanishing mixed propagator whose two point function diverges at small momenta . as a consequence , at small momentum , the potential of the theory is confined . <n> pacs numbers : 11.10.lm , 11.15.tk , 12.20.ds in this paper , we consider a nonlocal interaction between the gauge fields of a system in contact with a charge probe . we shall first recall that , as pointed out in ( [ 7 ] ) , such an interaction term can be chosen either in the form of a commutative part or as a mixed part of a propagators . in the first case ,<n> the interaction term is chosen to be the one of the form ( [ 9 ] and [ 49 ] in the text ) whereas in the second case it is taken as the interaction part of the mixed propagator . for the case of the first interaction term<n> , it turns out to be in this work we focused on the construction of a consistent extension of the @xmath0 model to the noncommutative space .<n> we found that the leading infrared divergences cancel if the basic field belongs to the left representation of the gauge group . up to the leading nontrivial order , all dangerous ir divergences<n> are absorbed into counterterms which preserve the form of the original lagrangian . in the present situation , however , there are trigonometric and momentum dependent form factors which smoothens the long -

field approximation ( mfa ) @xmath0@xcite and the monte - carlo approach ( mc@xmath1 ) to simulate turbulence @x in this work , we study the behavior of the pressure hessian and of the probability current associated with the anisotropic part of the velocity field in the case of a dissipative fluid .<n> we show that a simple gaussian approximation , or more sophisticated synthetic velocity fields , are able to reproduce the pressure anisotropy in the dissipation production dominated region of the phase diagram , whereas a deterministic closure fails to reproduce any of the properties of the hessian , in particular , its tails . <n> numerical simulations have been carried out in order to test the predictions of the synthetic velocity field , as well as those of the deterministic closure , against data obtained from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations in the presence of gravity . in the present work we focus on the problem of identifying the spatial and temporal variations of the invariant @xmath0 , i.e. on the pressure and probability current , associated with an isotropic velocity field @xcite , and on the corresponding spatial and time variations of a deviatoric velocity field associated with a multifractal velocity field ( mtlm , for short ) . here , @ we introduce a lagrangian model for the dynamics of periodic boundary conditions , based on the hessian of the spatial derivative of the flow variable @xmath0 .<n> this hessian is computed in fourier space , for a highly resolved periodic boundary condition , and we show that the resulting flow is well approximated by the solution of the linearized poisson equation . in the last decade<n> , the field of fluid dynamics has experienced a major breakthrough , both in terms of theoretical developments and in the development of experimental techniques . at the same time , it has become clear that the description of fluid flows must take into account non - linear effects , in particular non - equilibrium phenomena , such as phase transitions @xcite . <n> one of the most important problems in fluid dynamics is the description and understanding of non - stationary states , which are present in a large variety of physical systems , ranging from fluids with diffusive or non - diffusive transport to biological cells . to this end , there is a strong theoretical and experimental effort devoted to the study of equilibrium states of fluid - dynamical systems . among these ,<n> there is an extensive literature dealing with equilibrium states in fluid - dynamics , in this work , we investigate the hessian tensor structure of periodic differential equations ( dns ) .<n> we show that the probability densities of the eigenvalues of the deviatoric part of the true pressure hessian , as well as of the counteractive action of the pressure , are very similar for dns and dns with highly resolved velocity derivatives . however , the probability density of the enstrophy production dominated region is found to be void in probability for dns , while it is well correlated for dns with lower resolution . <n> differential equations have been used for a long time to model a wide range of phenomena , ranging from fluid flows to geophysical and planetary dynamics . in particular , they have been widely used to model turbulence , convection , turbulence transport , and convection in planetary atmospheres @xcite . recently ,<n> dns have also been proposed as a tool for the study of hessian - type tensors , in particular for the pressure @xmath0 , of an advection - diffusion system , which is relevant in the context of convective turbulence ( cf . ref . [ cf : cft ] ) and for the transport of heat ( in this article , we study the statistical nature of the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulence by means of synthetic velocity fields .<n> we show that these velocity fields reproduce many properties of the pressure hessian as they are seen in dns flows , such as the non - trivial behavior of the probability current , and the conditional expectation of thepressure hessian norm on the invariant @xmath0 . we also show that the local approximation to the velocity field reproduces quite well many of the properties observed in dns . <n> turbulence is one of the most complex physical phenomena in the universe . in nature ,<n> turbulent fluctuations are characterized by a large number of energy scales , which can be represented by a complex velocity field @xcite . as a consequence , the dynamics of turbulence<n> is characterized by the presence of dispersive and dissipative components , as well as non - gaussian velocity components . for a given turbulent energy spectrum , there is an associated energy flux , called turbulent kinetic energy , that is proportional to the turbulent velocity flux . from a statistical point of view , it is important to understand the behavior of these components in turbulent energy spectra , since we study the statistical properties of the pressure hessian of the velocity gradient tensor , @xmath0 , by means of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and exact field theory ( eft ) . in a first part , we show that synthetic velocity fields reproduce many properties of this quantity as they are seen in dns flows , such as the non - trivial behavior of the probability current , and the conditional expectation of thepressure hessian norm on the invariant .<n> we also show that the local approximation to the pressure - gradient - tensor closure can be expressed in terms of local properties and higher - order derivatives , but only if the closure is restricted to the region around position * x * , in a ball centered at * x*,@xmath1 and of radius of the order of the radius of unity . as a result ,<n> the main contribution to * p*(*x * ) is contained in the local neighborhood around position*x*,*xmath2 , *xmath3 * and radius of radius * x**,$ ] . <n> # 1 # 1eq .

compton radiations , @ the extragalactic jet sources 3c 75 and pks 2155 - 304 are the most prominent examples of colliding jets in the universe . in both cases , the x - ray emission from the colliding jets<n> is dominated by a hard spectrum , with a power - law index of @xmath0 .<n> the origin of the hard x - rays is still debated , but it may be related to the interaction of the jets with the dense interstellar medium ( ism ) in the host galaxy . here , we present simulations of colliding jet systems with different physical parameters , and we compare the results with the observed properties of 3c75 . <n> the collision of two jets is one of the most important events in the history of jets , as it may explain the hard spectrum of the sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or it may lead to the production of relativistic plasma in the jet - ism collision , like the ism of seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc 6240 , which was the first object to be observed colliding with jets . despite the importance of this event ,<n> the study of the collision mechanism is still in its infancy  we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the collision of two relativistic jets with different velocities in the impact parameter space .<n> we show that the energy density in the collision region is significantly reduced compared to the case of colliding jets with the same impact parameter . as a consequence of the reduced energy density ,<n> the total kinetic energy of the colliding jets is larger than that of the non - colliding jets . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hics ) are among the most violent events in the universe , and are expected to lead to the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high energy density ( @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ) @xcite . in order to fully explore the properties of the qgp<n> , it is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to its formation . among the different mechanisms that have been proposed for the production of qgp at rhic , one of the most promising mechanisms is the interaction of quarks and gluons in a high - energy colliding jet ( c jet ) with a surrounding medium ( medium ) . here , we present the results of a systematic study of the jet interactions in the framework of hydrodynamics  we study the dynamics of colliding jets using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .<n> we find that as the impact parameter and the velocity of the colliding jets are decreased , the system undergoes several instabilities : ( 1 ) jets break up into oscillating filaments , ( 2 ) bouncing jets occur , and ( 3 ) merging jets occur when the velocity difference between the jets is larger than a certain threshold value . as a result of the collisions ,<n> the total energy density of the system is reduced and the angle between the bouncing jets is reduced . in some cases , as a consequence of the breaking up of jets , there are two regimes of the parameter space , corresponding to bouncing and merging jets . <n> collision of two or more jets is one of the most important events in the history of the universe . during the last century<n> the rate of such collisions has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath0 yr@xmath1 @xcite , a value much lower than the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation rate , which is about 10 times larger . since the origin of the cmb is believed to be in the early universe , it is important to understand in the standard model of particle physics , the lagrangian density field is proportional to the square root of the velocity field , @xmath0 . here<n> , we study the propagation of relativistic jets in a dense ambient medium .<n> we show that the spread of the jet velocity increases as the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet increase . as a consequence ,<n> the two jets collide , generating more turbulence and driving more waves as they propagate . in the case of non - interacting jets , linear instabilities<n> grow non - linearly only after the jets travel about 20 kpc , and then they are enhanced in colliding jets . <n> relativistic jets are very fast moving particles , with lorentz factors in the range of 100@xmath1@xcite , which are fast enough to be observed in high energy cosmic ray ( cr ) experiments , such as the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , as well as in the core -

linear turbulence is generated in the interaction of the jets with each other and with the ambient medium . as a result of the interaction ,<n> most of the enstroph is generated near the collision site , but a significant fraction of it is also generated at the interaction point itself . in the non - interacting case , turbulence<n> is generated only about 20 kpc away from the source , so that it does not affect the radio emission of the extragalactic jets . using our simulations<n> , we find that the probability distribution function of the probability to find filaments in colliding jets is similar to that of point sources , except that the filaments form much earlier in the jets than in the case of point - like the generation of enstrophy in relativistic jet - jet collisions is investigated using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations .<n> we find that the enstroph maxima are created by the dissipative interaction of the jet gas with the ambient gas , and that the maximum of the en strophy is achieved when the impact parameter of the colliding jets is close to the critical point of the interaction . <n> the production of entropy in high - energy nuclear collisions is of fundamental interest in a variety of fields , including nuclear astrophysics , condensed matter physics , high energy physics and cosmology . in this work ,<n> we focus on the problem of how the entropy is generated in collisions of relativistic jets with an ambient medium . to this end<n> , we use three - dimensions to simulate the interaction of ultrarelativistic ( @xmath0 ) jets with a uniform ambient medium of gas pressure ( p = 10@xmath1 ) . using these simulations<n> we are able to study the dependence of the entropy production on the parameters of the collision , such as impact parameter , impact velocity and impact position , as well as on the mass and energy of the two colliding jets . from these results<n> we can the nearby galaxy cluster 3c 75 is known to host two active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , each of which is embedded in a low entropy core moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 1200 km / sec .<n> we present a study of the dynamics of the two jets in this system based on numerical simulations using equations of incompressible fluid dynamics . in our simulations , we found that the enstrophy , i.e. , the logarithm of the density of the gas in units of the critical density for gravitational instability , is dominated by stretching , and that the jet bending is due to a collision with the jet from the northern agn of the cluster . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : active ; quasars : general ; x -

observed quasar ( qso ) with two components : a fast ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) northern jet and a slower ( @ xmath2 km ) southern component . the northern jet is believed to originate from the merger of two supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the center of a seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc 6240 . at a distance of 10 mpc ,<n> the southern agn is almost perpendicular to the direction of the faster northern jet ( north - west ) , so that the two jets do not collide . however , in projection , a twisted radio morphology can be seen in this location , which suggests that the the radio source 3c 75 has been classified as a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) .<n> however , it has a very peculiar morphology , consisting of a bright , compact core surrounded by a network of kiloparsec - scale radio jets . here , we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of jet - jet collisions in order to understand the origin of this twisted radio structure . we find that the twisted radio morphology is a natural consequence of the strong instabilities generated in the faster jet by the collision with a much slower jet with a small , but finite impact parameter . <n> * keywords : * galaxies : individual ( 3c75 ) galaxies ; supernovae : general galaxies , active stars : winds , outflows hydrodynamics ism : jets and outflows <n> radio continuum emission from supernovae ( sne ) is a powerful diagnostic of the properties of their host galaxies @xcite . in particular ,<n> the morphology of the radio emission is a strong function of the mass of the host galaxy , as well as of the density of the ism and the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas . the brightest supernova in the galaxy we study the generation of a baroclinic shock wave in a hydrodynamical model of the collision of a high -

this is the most fundamental property of quantum systems , which has no analog in the classical world . as a result<n> , it is natural to ask how a quantum system can behave in the presence of a classical environment , given that the system is incoherent with respect to all its paths and all its correlations have been accounted for . a classical hamiltonian , on the other hand , does not take into account all its possible correlations ; hence , we show that the autocovariance matrix of a stochastic general equilibrium model can be decomposed into a sum of exponential decays .<n> the exponentials are of the form @xmath0 , where the constants are functions of time , and the coefficients are constants of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random variables . <n> pacs numbers : 02.50.-r , 05.45.tp , 89.65.gh , 89.90.+n stochastic processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , biology and finance . in particular , they play an important role in the evolution of complex systems , such as financial markets , chemical reactions , biological tissues , neural networks , among others @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the theory of stochastic processes has a long history , going back to the works of h. niewodniczaski on the probability distribution of chemical reactions and further extending to the work of s. wouters on the statistics of population sizes . for the last century<n> , stochastic processes have been used in the study of population dynamics , in particular in the analysis of time series , as well as in the prediction of we consider the spectral properties of wishart random matrices generated by a single point process .<n> it is shown that the spectral moments of the matrix can be used to estimate the parameters of the matrices . <n> _ keywords : _ wishart matrix , spectral moments , random matrix theory , econophysics _<n> pacs _ : 02.50.ey , 05.40.fb , 89.65.gh , 89.75.da the wishart model @xcite is a powerful tool for the analysis of financial time series . in this model ,<n> a random matrix is generated by the application of a random function to an unknown function of the variables of the model . for a given value of the parameters<n> , the model can be described by a wishart s matrix @xmath0 , where the matrix elements are given in the form of a square - root - of - a - number . as shown by smets and wouters ( 1980 ) , in the case of a gaussian process , this matrix is a generalized product moment distribution ( gpmd ) @x<n> . however , when the number of entries of we introduce the concept of spectral moments of correlated wishart matrices .<n> the spectral moments are the moments of the eigenvalue density of the empirical covariance matrix , which can be calculated from the time series of the correlation matrix . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the analysis of financial time series . <n> correlation matrices play an important role in signal processing and computational finance @xcite . in the field of financial analysis ,<n> the most used method for the estimation of the parameters of the underlying model is the so - called wishart matrix ( gsm ) @xmath0 , where the gsm is defined as the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of entries of a random variable ( rxv ) , obtained by averaging over all possible values of the variable s parameters . for a given number of rxvs , the pdf of gsm<n> is known as the _ spectral moment _ of the model , denoted by the symbol sjm@xmath1 for the case of _ random _ correlation matrix ( rcm ) and _ real - valued _ <n> covariance matrices ( cvms ) for the",

homogeneous random variable @xmath0 .<n> the algorithm is based on a combination of the metropolis and metropolis - hastings mcmc methods , and is designed to be efficient , in the sense that it does not require any prior knowledge of the distribution of the variables . <n> markov chains have become a standard tool for studying the statistical properties of complex systems , with applications ranging from statistical physics to biology . in the field of biological systems @xcite ,<n> it is important to be able to efficiently sample from a large number of possible solutions of a given problem , given the size of the system and the amount of data to be sampled . to sample efficiently from a given solution<n> , it is useful to know its stationary distribution , which can be estimated from the data itself , or from the properties of the solution itself . for a given time step , sampling from a stationary distribution<n> is easy , but sampling from the distribution itself is hard , especially if the distribution is time homogeneous , as is the case in many real -

homogeneous markov chains .<n> the algorithm is based on the exact mileston method , but adaptively distributes the points of the markov chain according to their distribution in state space , rather than focusing on the stationary distribution . as an application , we study the performance of this algorithm in computing time averages of a stochastic differential equation , and find that the adaptive algorithm outperforms the traditional one by a factor of @xmath0 in terms of error bars . <n> adaptive sampling is a powerful technique for performing simulations of complex dynamical systems @xcite . in this technique ,<n> a system s dynamics is simulated by evolving a sequence of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , starting from an initial distribution of the system . at each time step<n> , the sde is relaxed to its stationary value , which is a probability density function ( pdf ) in the state space of the initial distribution ; this pdf is then used to compute a time marginal of the time evolution of the dynamical system , or , in other words , a dynamical expectation value ( vev ) of the hamiltonian . for a in this paper , we present a new method for simulating stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .<n> the method is based on a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) approach , where the spde is approximated by a stationary distribution of a stochastic process ( sdp ) that is sampled at a different time ( resampling ) than the original spde . in the mcmc method ,<n> the system is represented as a markov process ( mp ) in state space , and the stochastic process is sampled using a deterministic ( hamiltonian ) lagrangian . <n> this paper is a first step in a series of papers in which we present mcmc methods for a variety of spde models , including the stochastic born - oppenheimer ( sboe ) equation , the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) model , ising spin glass ( isg ) with ising coupling , edward - weierstrass spin glass model ( iswm ) @xcite , as well as the ising model with isotropic heisenberg coupling ( ihm ) and its generalizations @x we prove a generalization of the hill relation for exact milestoning .<n> we show that this relation is identical to the exact hill relation in the stationary regime , and generalize it to any time homogeneous markov chain . as an example<n> , we show how this relation can be used to derive an exact algorithm for sampling from the stationary distribution of a time homogeneous chain with a source and sink . <n> the hill equation @xcite is the most basic equation in the theory of exact sampling . in its simplest form ,<n> this equation describes the probability @xmath0 that a random variable @x , starting at the origin , hits a stationary distribution @x<n> . this probability is called the _<n> stationary distribution_. it has been used to model a wide variety of phenomena , ranging from the motion of test particles in astrophysical plasmas to the dynamics of chemical reactions . for instance , in the study of molecular transport , it is often necessary to evaluate the mean square error ( mse ) , which is the difference between the mean value of the observable and the true value . the mse is the quantity that most directly measures the efficiency of the sampling process , i.e in this paper , we show that when @xmath0 , the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system interacting with a noisy electromagnetic field can be written as a convex combination of two hamiltonians , one of which is a linear combination of harmonic oscillators .<n> we use this result to give a new proof of a well - known result in quantum optics , namely , that when the coupling between the system and the electromagnetic field exceeds a critical value , then the system is always in a mixed state . <n> _ introduction _ the study of quantum systems interacting with noisy fields has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite . in particular ,<n> the problem of describing the quantum state of a system in the presence of a noisy field has attracted much attention , both from a theoretical and a practical point of view . for a classical system , this problem can be formulated as follows : suppose that the field is a damped harmonic oscillator ( h oscillator ) , and that the coupling strength between the field and the oscillator is a quadratic function of the amplitude of the oscillation . here<n> , a quadratic - to - linear coupling term is added to the damping term @x in this paper , we derive a new class of stochastic processes that can be used to describe the dynamics of complex networks .<n> we show that stochastic processes can be seen as a stochastic version of markov chain monte carlo , where the hamiltonian is @xmath0 , and the stochastic process is given by the probability density function of the markov process . as an example<n> , this paper shows that stochastic markov chains can be employed to describe complex networks in the presence of noise . <n> pacs numbers : : 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r , 89.70.+c , 89.75.da , 87.23.ge stochastic processes have been shown to be useful in many fields of science , such as the study of bacterial colonies @xcite , the prediction of the spread of disease in cells of the human immune system @xxcite and the detection of gravitational waves in the earth s atmosphere @x<n> . however , there is no general consensus on the way to describe stochastic processes in complex systems . in particular ,<n> it is not yet clear how to generalize the notion of stochastic process to systems with many degrees of freedom in this paper , we consider the problem of quantum teleportation between alice and bob in two - dimensional space - time .<n> we show that the probability of such a teleportation is given by @xmath0 , where the constants depend on the state of the sender and the receiver . <n> we also show that if the receiver and the sender share the same spacetime dimension , the teleportation process is reversible . as a consequence ,<n> we prove that the fidelity of teleportation can be made arbitrarily close to unity by using a small number of maximally entangled states ( mems ) , which are maximally mixed states of a mixture of classical and quantum states . *<n> introduction : * teleportation ( also known as quantum key distribution ) is one of the most important quantum protocols of the twentieth century . in its original formulation<n> , it was proposed to use teleportation as a way to transfer information between two spatially separated parties , one of which is alice slice and the other one bob . since then , several teleportation protocols have been proposed @xcite , among which the one proposed by erwin schrdinger ( epr ) @x in this paper , we present a new method for the calculation of the @xmath0-th order green s function of a quantum system .<n> the method is based on the solution of a system of differential equations , which we call the _ lem system _<n> , for the energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrix of the system of interest . in the lem<n> system , energy is decomposed into two parts : the energy of the ground state and that of the excited states . for a given energy ,<n> the ground states are decomposed into a set of eigenstates , each of which has a different eigenvalue , and the energy is the sum of the energies of these eigenvectors . <n> we call this system s _ eigenstate _ and call it _ quantum lem_. in quantum mechanics , the energy spectrum of a physical system can be written as the product of the energy levels of the hamiltonian , i.e. the energy difference between any pair of states in the system @xcite . from this spectrum , it is possible to calculate the energy level splittings , in this paper , we consider a bipartite quantum system consisting of a @xmath0 dimensional harmonic oscillator and a single -

body systems is one of the main topics in quantum information theory . for a given quantum system , which may be described by an eigenvalue spectrum @xcite or a hilbert space of eigenstates , there is a class of coupled quantum systems , called _ eigenmodes _ , that can be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , also known as _ partial differential equations _ ( pde ) or _ wave equations_. in particular , it is well known that the wave equation we present a new family of one -

propagate the input signal after it has been re - transmitted . to this end<n> , one usually has to solve an initial value problem , which is the solution of the transport equation @xmath0 , where the input is given by a system of equations ( e.g. , the schrdinger equation ) describing the propagation of a coherent wave packet in a medium of arbitrary refractive index . here<n> we consider an alternative approach , in which the initial data are we consider the problem of estimating the wigner measure @xmath0 of a random field @xcite with values in a finite interval @x .<n> we assume that the random field is invariant under the propagation of an initial signal . in this case<n> , it is known that the average spatial refocusing of the back - propagated signal is much better in random media than in homogeneous media . here , we prove that the same result holds for the estimation of wigner measures of random fields in general , but not for those of gaussian random fields . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain the convergence of the expectation of the random wigner transform to its deterministic limit . <n> random fields are ubiquitous in many areas of science and technology , for example in particle physics , signal processing , linguistics , and image processing . on the one hand , they play an important role in various communication systems , such as free - space communications , optical fibers , satellite communication , or more recently in distributed computing systems such as random graphs @x<n> . however , in many applications , one is interested in the impact of the medium on the measurement process , e.g. in we consider the wigner distribution in a one - dimensional random medium .<n> we show that its wigner transform is given by an approximate @xmath0-martingale , and we derive the transport equation for the corresponding random potential . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the seminal work of wigner , @xcite , on wigner distributions in random media , there has been a great deal of progress in the understanding of these distributions . in particular<n> , it has been shown that in one dimension , a wigner process is deterministic if and only if its refraction index satisfies a uniform a priori @x <n> t bound . on the other hand ,<n> it is well - known that in higher dimensions the refraction index of a random medium can be non - deterministic , even if it satisfies the uniform apriori bound , provided that the initial distribution is sufficiently singular . for this reason , in recent years the random media have been called _ wigner glasses _ or _ random glasses_. in this paper , we study in detail the case where the refractive index of the medium is a random function of a non -

vmsta.cfg convergence of transport processes to solutions of ordinary differential equations is a well - known phenomenon in statistical mechanics @xcite . in particular , the martingale property is a fundamental result in the theory of stochastic differential equations , and is used to prove convergence in many practical situations , such as in the modeling of transport through random media . on the other hand<n> , convergence to a solution of an ordinary differential equation is not guaranteed in general . for example , it is known that the lyapunov exponent of a hamiltonian on the real line converges to zero as the number of degrees of freedom tends to infinity , but it is not known whether the same holds for a we consider the markov process @xmath0 generated by an infinitesimal generator of the wigner process in the case of a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .<n> we show that the process converges to a martingale with a finite mean and a finite variance as the lattice spacing increases . in the limit of a large lattice<n> , we recover the well - known result for the one - parameter family of stationary processes . <n> markov processes are one of the most important tools in the study of stationary states of quantum many - body systems @xcite . they have been extensively used to model the dynamics of phase transitions in condensed - matter systems , such as spin glasses and superconducting qubits , as well as to model dynamics in molecular and atomic gases , and to study transport properties of liquids . as an example , in the context of quantum spin glasses , a markov chain has been proposed and analyzed in refs.@xcite for the time - evolution of the state of a spin system in an external magnetic field . the time evolution of this process is described by a transport equation , which is the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) on the hilbert in this note , we present a new approach to the proof of the @xmath0-contribution to the lyapunov exponent of a path .<n> the method is based on the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations , which we call the gauss - bonnet equation , with an additional nonlinearity term . in this paper ,<n> we present an asymptotic analysis of a gaussian path system with respect to the nonlinearity parameter , and , as a consequence , obtain a new proof of a well - known @xcite lower bound on the kolmogorov s @x<n> smirnov exponent . <n> the study of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlsde ) has a long history , going back to the work of lindblad , but it was rediscovered by lindlund , schumacher and schiffler in the 1950 s , who applied the results from the theory of hamiltonian systems to the analysis of the lnsde of a one -

difference transformation _<n> ( mdt ) . in this method ,<n> the difference between two operators is expressed as a function of the dimension of the hilbert space spanned by the operators . as an application of the method<n> , it is shown that one can recover the exact martingales for the case where the two operators have the same dimension . <n> the aim of this paper is to present a method to calculate the mean - zeros ( mzms ) of two tensor product operators , i.e. , tensor product of two non - commuting operators ; see @xcite for a recent review . the method relies on the idea that two tensor products are related to each other by a particular transformation . for a given tensor product , the difference of its two coefficients<n> is expressed in terms of a certain mds , called _ hilbert - schmidt transform _ ( we study the statistical mechanics of a quantum dot coupled to a heat bath .<n> the dot - bath coupling is taken to be @xmath0-th order in the bath - dot coupling , and the quantum dot is assumed to be initially localized in the domain of the bath , in the sense that it does not change any of the energy of the quantum system , but only its position and momentum with respect to the bath<n> . then the system can be approximated by the solution of a set of ordinary differential equations , which is the sum of two terms , one depending on the state of the system and the other on the bath state . in the first term<n> the system is described by a hamiltonian , while in the second term we consider an effective action which is a weighted average of the two hamiltonians . <n> we show that in the limit of weak dissipation and large bath -dot coupling the system described by the effective action converges to that of a classical system . as a result<n> , we obtain a closed formula for the steady - state distribution of the temperature and the two - point correlation function in the thermodynamic limit . for weak dissipation<n> we recover the well - known result that the steady in this note , we show that the wigner function @xmath0 of a tensor product of real scalar fields on the torus can be decomposed into a sum of two terms .<n> the first one is given by a martingale , and the second one is a non -

tensor fields and pseudo - scalar fields , in particular to include tensor fields on a hyperboloid , see e.g. refs . and references therein . on the other hand , the decomposition of hamiltonians into real tensors<n> is still an open problem . here<n> we are interested in in this note , we prove that the limit measure of a deterministic quantum transport equation is a martingale . <n> [ section ] [ theorem]lemma [ theorem ] proposition [ theorem],corollary [ theorem][ theorem]conjecture _ dedicated to the memory of jan kuperman .<n> _ + _ department of mathematics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095 -

<n> it is well - known that instantons do indeed play an important role in the qcd description , in particular in the so - called  mixing '' region @xcite . however , it is not yet clear what role instantons play in the  zero mode '' region , since the lattice configurations used in the simulations are not necessarily  smooth '' , i.e. the instantons are not exactly localised in the lattice volume . as a result<n> , we do not yet have a clear picture of what part of the spectrum is reproduced by instanton - only theories , at least in the quenched approximation . here<n> i show that the monte carlo simulation of the in this talk i show that the instanton and the smoothed ensembles of the dirac operator have quite different low lying eigenmodes .<n> this is a consequence of the approximate chiral symmetries of the two ensembles . on the smoothed ensemble<n> there is a substantial  piling up '' of modes above im(@xmath0 ) , and then a  thinning '' of these modes at around 0.5 . in the presence of antiperiodic boundary condition in the time direction , the quark density of the eigenvectors corresponding to the peak of the distribution<n> are much more delocalised than all the other eigenstates occurring in either ensemble . <n> the pcac formulation of lattice qcd is based on the construction of a dirac fermion action on lattices of size @xmath1 generated by wilson fermions . at low energies , this action is known as the  instanton '' action , since it yields the exact chiral symmetry of qcd on the lattices @xcite . however , it has been pointed out by several authors that the clover action is also quite satisfactory in the chiral limit , but it has a peculiar mixture of q cd and i present a study of the mixing of instantons with and without confinement on lattices of different sizes .<n> i show that without confinement , the instanton ensemble contains a large number of free field modes that contaminate the hadron correlators producing unusually light hadrons . on the other hand<n> , confinement completely eliminates the freely propagating quarks . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the presence of confinement only , without instantons , there is a very small physical size that the instantons almost never contain . in a lattice of size @xmath0 , i found that the spatial size of the lowest instanton eigenmodes is less than 2 , which is smaller than the typical size of lattices with periodic boundary conditions , but still larger than the size of typical instanton liquid lattices , of which the smallest ones are less than 1 . as a result ,<n> the lattice instantons alone can not reproduce most of the properties of the light quark - antiquark system . #<n> 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) lattice qcd is one of the most powerful tools to study the i present some results on the spectroscopy of quarks in lattice qcd with dynamical @xmath0 wilson fermions .<n> the emphasis is on the effect of confinement on the physical observables . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the absence of confinement , the physical qcd correlators are dominated by the free quark modes . in the presence of confinement<n> , however , these modes provide a very effective way to propagate quarks and they contaminate the hadron correlation functions . here<n> i show that it is possible to suppress them by adding a smooth background to the perturbative gauge field configurations , but only if the background is locally very smooth and has a physical size much smaller than the lattice spacing . to be able to do that , i had to superimpose the smooth background onto a set of wilson instanton configurations that were themselves very smooth , and i did this by distributing the average polyakov loop evenly among the links in the given direction . the addition of this smooth background did not change the physical quantities , it only increased the correlation functions and they are the same on the instanton and on the background configurations . [<n> fig. in this talk i present results from a study of the hadron spectroscopy in landau gauge qcd in the chiral limit .<n> the monte carlo simulations were performed using a  chirally optimised '' clover fermion action , where the fluctuations of the gauge field were restricted to instantons only . <n> this approach reproduces quite well the physical qcd results . the perturbative toron correlators are studied in lattice qcd with @xmath0 hermitian lattice dirac operators .<n> the optimised action is found to give anomalously light mesons and a small splitting between the pseudoscalar and the vector channel , which is in agreement with the results of the instanton liquid model . on the other hand , the wilson gauge field fluctuations on the lattice are found to be crucial for restoring the physical meson correlationors . <n> pacs numbers : 11.15.ha , 12.38.gc , 14.40.aq , 14.65.dw , 11.10.wx , 11.55.hx in this paper , i study the , so - called ,  toron ensemble '' , that is the ensemble of hadrons that are produced in the qcd vacuum by the nonperturbative gauge field dynamics . this ensemble is expected to exhibit much stronger finite size effects than qcd , from which the instantons have been extracted . in particular , it is expected that the torons might be needed only for compensating the unnaturally large finite size effect due to the absence of confinement . here<n> i the spectrum of any wilson type lattice dirac operator @xmath0 is shown to be non - degenerate if and only if its real eigenvalues and their complex conjugates are non - zero .<n> this property is used to prove that the physical meson correlators are the same as those of the perturbative toron ensemble , in particular the quark condensate and the pion mass , for su(2 ) lattice gauge theory . <n> it has been known for some time that lattice qcd , with wilson fermions , can be used to model chiral symmetry breaking . in this paper<n> i show that it is also possible to use the same fermionic ensemble to model mesons and baryons as in qcd @xcite . as a first step ,<n> i prove that if the lattice fermion mass is set to zero , and the lattice spacing is fixed to be the physical value , then any meson - baryon correlator is equal to the physical one , i.e. the condensate of chirally invariant quarks and antiquarks , as measured by the ratio of the decay constants of the corresponding meson and bar we prove that the spectrum of any ( third ) lattice dirac operator @xmath0 is symmetric with respect to the real axis if and only if the corresponding eigenvalues and their complex conjugates are real . as an application<n> , we show that the fermion spectral density of the deconfined phase of su(2 ) quenched gauge theory on the square lattice is identical to that of the chiral condensate . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the properties of the fermi surface ( fs ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the major challenges in condensed matter physics today .<n> the fs is a key ingredient in the construction of exact monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms for lattice gauge theories @xcite , and plays an important role in the development of the metropolis - hastings ( mhd ) and metropolis - ising ( mi ) mc algorithms . in the case of lattice gauge theory ,<n> it is important to understand the relation between the spectrum , the spectral density and the hamiltonian , in order to understand how fermions behave in the presence of quenched disorder . for quenched q",

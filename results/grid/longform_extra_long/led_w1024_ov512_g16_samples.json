( [ eqn : corrslope ] ) , it actively acts on the boundary behaviour order @xmath190 to order @xmath191 @xcite , sufficient smoothness of @xmath51 permitting . subparagraphspecifically , if @xmath51 admits continuous fourth - order partial derivatives and is positive at @xmath67 , then @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 with @xmath195 . starting from @xmath196 , the algebraic differentiation provides all partial derivatives of @xmath197 up to order four in terms of @xmath16 and its partial derivatives up to order four . subparagraphnaturally , @xmath16 will be assumed to admit continuous fourth - order partial derivatives . subparagraph[ ass : cop4 ] the copula density @xmath198 admits continuous fourth - order partial derivatives on the interior of the unit square @xmath23 .     as previously , it readily follows from ( [ eqn : normfsttilde2 ] ) that @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is an expression of the same type as ( [ eqn : biasctilde1 ] ) , this time involving the partial derivatives of @xmath16 up to the fourth order . subparagraph[ ass : cop4 ] the copula density @xmath - negative integral powers @xmath210 , and all those functions tend to 0 as @xmath211 . suburhence , @xmath201 may actually tend to 0 towards the boundaries , and the bias there be actually of order @xmath212 . suburagain , this will be the case where @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply when approaching the boundary . suburthe expression of the variance is the same as that for @xmath213 and @xmath214 , except that it has been inflated by a factor @xmath215 . suburthis inflation factor is , also , a well - known feature in local polynomial modelling when fitting a higher - degree polynomial ( * ? ? ? ?============* section 3.3.1 ) . suburinterestingly , _escriptiontechniques for reducing the bias of kernel estimators from @xmath190 to @xmath191 , e.g.  higher - order kernels or multiplicative adjustment , have long been an active research topic @xcite . yet , few of those methods have actually taken hold . suburthe main reason is that the demonstrated improvement is an asymptotic result , which usually goes unnoticed for sample sizes one typically has in practice while implying interpretability issues ( . suburhowever , the fact remains that the suggested estimators have a variance behaving like @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 , as @xmath74 . suburhence , @xmath220 tends to grow unboundedly when @xmath145 approaches one of the boundaries . suburnote that this is also the case for other copula density estimators attempting to correct the boundary bias , see for instance ( * ? ? ? ) and @xcite who obtain similar unbounded boundary variance for the beta kernel and the bernstein estimators . suburfacing the same situation in the univariate case , @xcite suggested to use @xmath216-nearest - neighbor ( @xmath216-nn ) type bandwidth in the transformed domain . suburalthough barely used for standard kernel density estimation , @xmath216-nn bandwidths appeared totally appropriate in @xcite s framework and , indeed , managed to stabilise the variance towards the boundaries . suburthis is also the case in the univariate case , @xcite suggested to use @xmath216-nearest - neighbor ( @xmath216-nn ) type bandwidth in the transformed domain . suburalthough barely used for standard kernel density estimation , @xmath grows unboundedly towards boundaries . suburthis results in estimates more stable and much smoother towards the borders of @xmath23 . suburthis results in estimates more stable and much smoother towards the borders of @xmath23 . suburin fact , given that the ( long ) tails of @xmath231 in the transformed domain becomes the ( short ) boundary regions of @xmath232 in @xmath23 through the compressing back - transformation @xmath233 , @xmath231 must have _ very smooth _ tails in @xmath50 to produce suitably smooth boundary behaviour for @xmath232 . suburthis is exactly what is achieved by using a @xmath216-nn bandwidth in the @xmath47-domain : local likelihood density estimators using @xmath216-nn bandwidth are , indeed , known to produce smoother estimates in the tails than their fixed - bandwidth counterparts , avoiding the occurrence of ` spurious bumps ' . suburhence the appropriateness of the method here . suburthis is illustrated in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] . suburagain , the previous simulated data set was used to produce the two ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimates shown in the middle ( local log - linear section [ sec : realdat ] . Summarythe behaviour of kernel estimators is known to be crucially dependent on their smoothing parameter , whose choice in practice is unanimously recognised as a very difficult problem , especially in more than one dimension . here an effective way for selecting a suitable bandwidth matrix @xmath236 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is suggested . Summaryit can be understood that the diagonal elements @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath76 quantify the amount of smoothing applied in the directions of the main @xmath55- and @xmath13-axes , hence their values will drive the overall smoothness of the resulting estimate @xmath239 and eventually that of @xmath232 . on the other hand, it can be understood that @xmath240 sets the direction along which that smoothing mostly takes place in @xmath50 . It can be understood that if @xmath24 is the bivariate gaussian kernel , the local weights around @xmath83 will be set by the elliptical contour lines of the @xmath241-distribution . Additionally, if @xmath51 is stretched along a particular direction of @xmath50 , which will be the case if @ of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 . of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 . of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 . of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 . of @xmath257 , it is well known that the samples @xmath258 and @xmath259 are uncorrelated , hence estimating @xmath257 via any kernel method from the sample @xmath260 can be based on a diagonal bandwidth matrix @xmath261 with little side effect . of @xmath261an idea is then to select @xmath262 and @xmath263 independently via univariate procedures . of course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath262 and @xmath263 . of course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath264 and @xmath265 ( @xmath93 ) , the local log - polynomial estimators for the density of @xmath266 and @xmath267 , respectively math278 in the local log - quadratic case . suburthe estimate of @xmath51 can finally be obtained by linear back - transformation of the estimate of @xmath257 from the @xmath256-domain to the @xmath47 domain . suburit must be noted , though , that , again due to ( [ eqn : linequiv ] ) , this exactly amounts to directly estimating @xmath51 from @xmath82 using the bandwidth matrix @xmath278 when the estimator is to be built on a @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix , the procedure is very similar . suburthe data are transformed into the sample @xmath260 via ( [ eqn : pca ] ) . suburthen , a suitable value of @xmath225 in the @xmath266-direction is computed as @xmath280 i.e.  exactly as in ( [ eqn : hcv ] ) but this time @xmath264 is the estimator based on the @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix , the procedure is very similar . suburthe data are transformed into the sample @xmath260 via ( [ eqn : pca ] ) . suburthen , a suitable value of @ ' vector is , therefore , @xmath295 . embodimentsit is acknowledged that this procedure may lack of sufficient theoretical support . embodimentsfor instance , it is known that pre - sphering the observations in the process of selecting the bandwidth matrix is justified only if the underlying density @xmath51 is bivariate normal , that is , in this framework , if @xmath16 is the gaussian copula . embodimentslikewise , choosing @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( or @xmath285 and @xmath281 ) independently via univariate procedures would be suitable in theory only if @xmath266 and @xmath267 were independent , not only uncorrelated . embodimentsthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a heuristic , _ ad - hoc _ correction . having said this , it was found that this way of doing gave very reliable results , as illustrated in figures [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] and [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] in the simulation study and the real data analysis detailed in the next sections . embodimentsthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a n : naivefeas ] ) and its amended version @xmath301 , whose idea is exposed in section [ subsec : naive ] ( for a general , non - diagonal matrix @xmath76 , the amendment takes a slightly more complicated form than ( [ eqn : amendnaive ] ) ) . the bandwidth matrix @xmath76 was selected via a direct plug - in method @xcite in the transformed domain @xmath47 ;

splines estimators when the dependence is not close to null . suburwhen the depence is very low , @xmath348 and @xmath349 do better , which can be easily understood . suburit is well known that the mirror reflection estimator efficiently deals with boundary effects only when the partial derivatives of @xmath16 are 0 there ( ` shoulder ' ) . suburit is , therefore , particularly appropriate for the independence copula ( @xmath350 ) and other very flat copula . in addition , the above observations support that bad smoothing parameter choice is not the only reason for the poor performance of some of those estimators , i.e. other evidence of that will be given in the next section on a real data set . in addition , the above observations support that bad smoothing parameter choice is not the only reason for the poor performance of some of those estimators , i.e. other evidence of that will be given in the next section on a real data set . in fact , the local log -

Theoreticallythe main reason for this renewed interest is the fact that the most popular extensions of the standard model of high energy physics , such as string or m theory , when applied to cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _ i.e.  _ refs . exting@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which is currently in use in cosmology , which, so far , has been so successful is the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds . in particular , the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds is a nontrivial problem . in particular , the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds is a nontrivial problem.an important test is to calculate the evolution of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations through the , from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . , from a mathematical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a mathematical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a mathematical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a mathematical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a mathematical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected . ,from a mathematical point of view , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce . ,from a mathematical point of view ,the main disadvantage of the procedure is that it renders the computation extremely complicated and only numerical calculations are available to make the problem tractable . ,from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected .an important point to be noticed is that , as already mentioned above , most models assume that the spatial sections are flat all the time whereas , at the bounce , the curvature term is expected to play a crucial role .therefore , it seems that for a bouncing a given fourier mode , we write the @xmath6 dependence of these modes as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the same manner , after the bounce , one decomposes the perturbation as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .the effect of the bounce is then entirely encoded into the form of the transition matrix @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 the mode of interest is of course the dominant mode in the expanding phase , @xmath13 .the equation corresponds to a general `` @xmath6-mode mixing , '' _ a priori.e.  _ the dominant mode after the bounce is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .- a priori.e.  _ the mode mixing is valid for a fixed fourier mode and should not be confused with the mode mixing coming from nonlinearities which involves modes with different wave numbers . ]     _ a priori _ , various different situations can occur : the dominant mode in the contracting phase could acquire a scale invariant spectrum which is not conveyed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase because it turns out that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( `` @xmath6- transfer matrix is assumed not to depend on @xmath6  @xcite . within this framework, the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase , _ i.e.  _ to insure that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion.    the present article aims at examining whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is @xmath6-independent is generically valid or not . for this purpose, we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce . embodimentswe choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section ( see the remarks above ) , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref . embodimentswe do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce , and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase . embodimentstherefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the are never affected by the bounce . extingwe assume that the background model is given by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , _ [i.e.  _ @xmath17\\ , .\\ ] ] in this equation , the constant parameter @xmath18 can always be rescaled such that @xmath19 and describes the curvature of the spatial sections . extingthe time @xmath20 is the conformal time related to the cosmic time by @xmath21 . extingthe matter is described by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath22 and the corresponding energy density and pressure respectively read @xmath23 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time . extingthe function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field . extingthe time @xmath20 is the conformal time related to the cosmic time by @xmath21 . extingthe matter is described by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath22 and the corresponding energy density and pressure respectively read @xmath23 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time . extingthe function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field . extingeinstein equations relate the scale when @xmath44 as revealed by the equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ratio of the total energy density @xmath47 to the critical energy density .when it comes to numerical applications , let us recall that one can safely assume the preferred value  @xcite @xmath48  km@xmath49s@xmath50mpc@xmath51 with @xmath52 , leading to a hubble distance scale now of @xmath53  mpc  @xmath54  gpc .when it comes to numerical applications , one has a curvature length , namely the scale factor as measured now  @xcite , of order @xmath56  gpc ( with @xmath57 ) , the limit coming from the maximum allowed value for @xmath58 at one @xmath59 level .     at the perturbed level , and in the presence of density perturbations only at the perturbed level, the metric takes the following form @xmath60 { \\mathrm{d}}x^i { \\mathrm{d}}x^j \\right\\}\\ , , ,   \\label{pertmet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @ when one looks at the cosmological parameters discussed above , one finds that the values of @xmath65 corresponding to characteristic distance scales of cosmological interest now , namely @xmath75  mpc  @xmath76  mpc , range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the largest possible value of the total density now . for a reasonable value of @xmath65 is between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .the scalar perturbations are described by the four functions , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and , from them , it is possible to construct two gauge - invariant quantities , called the bardeen potentials , and defined by  @xcite @xmath86'\\ , , \\quad   \\psi \\equiv \\psi -\\frac{a'}{a}(b - e')\\ , .\\ ] ] for simple form of matter with no anisotropic stress ( this is the case for a scalar field ) , we have @xmath87 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\notice that the form of the bardeen potentials is the same whatever the curvature of the spatial sections is .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ xmath99 then , the equation of motion for the quantity @xmath96 takes the form @xmath100u=0\\ , .\\ ] ] in the above equation , one has @xmath101 for the scalar field , when use is made of the klein - gordon equation @xmath102 the quantity @xmath103 of eq .escription( [ cs2 ] ) can , in some regimes , be interpreted as the sound velocity . suburlet us now see how the flat case is recovered . suburthe term @xmath104 is of order @xmath105 , namely @xmath106 . suburthis is a rigorous statement if the scale factor is a power law of the conformal time , which explains the usual confusion between the potential and the hubble scale . suburhowever , this identification suffers from important exceptions , particularly relevant in the present context ;

Additionally,the relevant wave numbers , seen as eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator , then must scale correspondingly , _,i.e.  _ they are reduced by the amount @xmath121 which is , indeed , much smaller than unity in any inflationary scenario . Additionally,the equation of motion for the quantity @xmath96 , eq .escription( [ eomu ] ) , has the traditional form of a parametric oscillator equation , _,i.e.  _ of a `` time - independent '' schrdinger equation . however , in the case @xmath122 , the effective potential can not be written as the second time derivative of some function ( @xmath98 in the flat case ) over the same function because of the presence of the term @xmath123 in the time - dependent frequency . Additionally,the equation of motion for the quantity @xmath112 , eq .escription( [ eomu ] ) , has for consequence that , on `` super - horizon '' scales where the term @xmath112 is negligible , the @xmath132 is defined by @xmath133 this equation was obtained previously in ref . extingthe same remark as for the @xmath96 equation applies : in the @xmath122 the effective potential is not only @xmath134 ( as in the flat case ) but is corrected by the @xmath135 term . extingin addition , the effective potential now depends on the wave number @xmath65 through the quantity @xmath132 . extingthis has to be contrasted with the effective potential for @xmath96 , @xmath104 , which is @xmath65-independent .    having defined the various quantities needed to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations through a bouncing phase , we now turn to the description of the bounce itself . subparagraphin this section , we define precisely the behavior of the scale factor during the bouncing epoch , then discuss its relation with the following eras of standard cosmology and derive the relevant perturbation potentials .      corresponding to the de sitter - like solution [ eq . subparagraph( [ ds ] ) , full line ] and its various levels of approximations stemming from eq . subparagraph( [ aseries ] ) , namely up to quadratic ( dashed much the same way . the background equation of state should be close to vacuum .however , contrary to the inflation case , there is no fundamental reason why the background equation of state should be close to vacuum . despite this fact, one can nevertheless expand around the @xmath57 de sitter spacetime and similarly define parameters which control the departure from it . in the case of the de sitter spacetime , one can also define parameters which control the departure from it .obviously , those parameters are not subject to tight constraints , and in particular are not required to be small .the potential for the scalar field @xmath140 ( varying between @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the overall evolution of the universe ) for the de sitter - like solution with @xmath139.,width=340 ]    ) of the potential for the scalar field @xmath140 ( in units of the planck mass @xmath141 ) for different values of the bounce characteristic conformal time @xmath142 .the full lines are respectively for @xmath143 ( above ) and @xmath139 ( below ) , the dashed line corresponds to @xmath144 , and the dotted line is for @xmath145 . in the rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) , one obtains @xmath156 where we have set @xmath157 as the cosmic time @xmath157 as the cosmic time @xmath158 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath159 , and we also have defined a parameter @xmath160 for further convenience. we shall keep this definition later on for more general bounces than the quasi - de sitter ones . Additionallyit should be noted that the parameter @xmath161 , in the case of de sitter like expansion ( [ ds ] ) is , according to the definition ( [ nec ] ) , @xmath162 , which is proportional to @xmath163 . as a result , one has @xmath164 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath163 . as a result , one has @xmath164 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath163 . as a result , one has @xmath164 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath164 . as a result , one has @xmath164 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath164 . as a result , one has @xmath164 , _ i. ) and plugging it into the form ( [ deftheta ] ) yields @xmath175 which , together with @xmath176 [ this stems from eq .escription( [ cs2 ] ) with the solution ( [ ds ] ) and the scalar field ( [ scalareta ] ) ] leads to @xmath177 or , in other words , the potential for the variable @xmath96 does not depend on time for the de sitter - like solution .escriptionbesides , the maximum value achievable by this potential is given for the limiting case @xmath178 , and it is @xmath179 : this potential can only interact with the modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which we already mentioned are gauge modes .escriptionthis was to be expected since the exact de sitter solution , in this bouncing situation as in the more usual inflationary scenario , does not amplify scalar perturbations by any amount .escriptionwe believe that this is what happens in fig .  4 of ref .escription@xcite in which the bardeen potential mode @xmath180 is seen to oscillate while passing through a de sitter - like bounce , reflecting the nondomination of the potential at this point .escriptionthis was ( [ ds ] ) , whereas @xmath186 and @xmath187 measure the deviation with respect to this de sitter - like solution . //[ ds ] ) represents a double expansion , both around @xmath181 and around the de sitter - like solution discussed in the previous section since @xmath188 exactly corresponds to the small @xmath189 expansion of the scale factor ( [ ds ] ) ; this explains , among others , the factor @xmath190 in this equation . embodimentsthe parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 are in a certain sense similar to the traditional slow - roll parameters . both the de sitter form and its approximations are shown in figs .

the scalar field potential @xmath24 and the initial conditions , for instance the values of the scalar field and its first derivative at the bounce : @xmath191 , @xmath192 , have been chosen . embodimentswe now discuss how the general expansion  ( [ aseries ] ) can be related to an field vanishes at the bounce , then @xmath201 .physicalto first order , the einstein equations yield @xmath202

equations . embodimentseither the kinetic energy vanishes at the bounce or @xmath204 but then @xmath205 and @xmath206 . embodimentsthis means that the bounce occurs at the minimum of the scalar field potential . embodimentsthis also implies that , in this case , the minimum of the potential can not vanish , @xmath207 , see eq .escription( [ a0 ] ) . embodimentsif , for instance , the potential is given by @xmath208 , as is the case for instance of the model studied in ref . embodiments@xcite , then the only way to have a symmetric bounce is to satisfy the condition @xmath209 at the bounce and

be positive definite in a small but finite neighborhood of @xmath181 provided @xmath218 in the limit @xmath219 we will be concerned with . combining both constraints , we arrive at @xmath220we arrive at @xmath220 the approximation method we discuss later does not allow to consider very small values for @xmath187 , so that in practice , we shall use @xmath221 . nominewe now assume the fiducial expansion ( [ aseries ] ) for the bounce through which we want to propagate the perturbations . nominelet us however first examine the connection of this bounce to the standard cosmological epochs of radiation and matter domination .        in this section , we study how the bounce that we described previously can be connected to an epoch of the standard hot big bang model . nominein particular , we study the connection with a radiation dominated era . in this case, the scale factor can be written as @xmath222 where @ connects the bounce to a regime where the curvature is important or , in other words , in a region where the sine function appearing in the scale factor  ( [ scalerad ] ) can not be approximated by the first term of the taylor expansion , @xmath236 . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to violate the null energy condition , as already noticed in ref . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would have been to consider the case @xmath236 for modeling the bounce since this was done precisely in order to satisfy this condition . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to violate the null energy condition , as already noticed in ref . subur@xcite and to have a small @xmath193 but then it would have been useless to consider the case @xmath237 for modeling the bounce since this was done precisely in order to satisfy this condition . suburtherefore , we conclude that between the bounce and the standard hot big bang , another phase must necessary occur whose main effect will be to drive @xmath238 to sufficiently large values . suburthis is usually the role played by a phase of inflation .    with the general framework of inflation .    with the general framework of inflation . from the figure that the expansion ( [ aseries ] ) , if pushed to sufficiently high orders in @xmath189 , gives back the correct constant value over a large range of conformal times . suburlet us now turn to the more general bounce case of eq .ahime( [ aseries ] ) . suburlet us now turn to the more general bounce case of eq .ahime( [ aseries ] ) . suburarbitrary values for the parameter @xmath187 restricted to the range of interest discussed above lead to the generic shape illustrated in fig . suburthe calculation of the effective potential is extremely complicated even with the quartic approximation of the scale factor . even if it can be done in full generality since , for a scale factor given by eq .ahime( [ aseries ] ) , the potential @xmath244 reads @xmath245 where @xmath246 and @xmath247 are two polynomials of order @xmath248 , in practice the calculation is not tractable . suburhowever , since in practice we always have @xmath249 , only the first monomials are important . suburone can check that the following approximation @xmath250 is extremely good , see fig . subur[ fitprd ] . ges as @xmath256 . suburit is shown in ref . suburit is shown in ref . subur@xcite that this property also holds in the case

suburwe have seen previously that the values of @xmath65 of astrophysical interest are such that @xmath258 . suburtherefore , a necessary condition for the bounce to affect the spectrum of the fluctuations is that @xmath193 be close to one . suburas already discussed , the physical interpretation is that one must be very close to a violation of the null energy condition . in this case, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq . practition( [ upsilon ] ) . in practice, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq . practition( [ upsilon ] ) . in practice, @xmath161 must be a tiny number in order to get a modification of the spectrum . suburwe have seen that this is to be expected since @xmath given by @xmath272 and can be expressed as @xmath273 the height of the wing also diverges as one approaches the violation of the null energy condition and , at first order in @xmath161 , one has @xmath274 . nominethis concludes the description of the perturbation potential with which we now examine the fate of the perturbations themselves . nominethe purpose of this section , which is also our main result , is to show that the transfer matrix @xmath275 of eq . exting( [ transt ] ) may depend on the wave number @xmath65 in a way which we derive . nominewe found that two completely different and independent methods , one based on a piecewise expansion of the potential and the other assuming the potential to behave mathematically as a distribution rather than a simple function in the limit @xmath219 ,

[ 910 ] illustrates this fact and summarizes the situation by showing a sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .      for the perturbation variables, we are able to show a log - log sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential . two situations , namely preheating and bounce transitions , is that in the latter case the potential and the hubble scale behave in completely different ways whereas they correspond in the former , at least in the region of potential crossing . in the case of the preheating phase , the potential tends to @xmath235 , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation . in the case of the preheating phase , the potential tends to @xmath235 , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation . in this section ,we conclude that in the bounce case , the potential is the quantity that matters and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . as a consequence , for practical calculatory purposes , the phrase `` hubble crossing '' appears misleading in this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .in this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed spatial section case in order to satisfy the null energy condition  @xcite 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . subur[ sketch ] . suburthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 . suburin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref . exting@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref . exting@xcite . suburparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation . suburnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly . suburthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the , based on a completely different theory of gravity , in which neither variable happens to be bounded at the bounce . Theoreticallythe spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces . Theoreticallythe spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces . Theoreticallythis exemplifies the fact that there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce . Theoreticallythe picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig . Theoreticallythe picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig . Theoreticallythe first phase of the model is shown in fig . Theoretically[ sketch ] and consists in a regime in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well suited , as is the case for instance in many string motivated scenarios  @xcite ; this first phase allows an easy calculation of a spectrum of perturbation that would be sort of pre - primordial . then, unless the curvature was always important in this first period , it is followed by an unknown epoch which connects to the bounce itself , which should also be followed by yet another unknown epoch in order for p. turok , , 086007 ( 2002 ) ; j.  khoury , b.  a.  ovrut , p.  j.  steinhardt , and n.  turok , , 046005 ( 2002 ) ; r.  durrer , [ hep - th/0112026 ] .

driven or hypothesis - driven methods , with only partial information available .  embodiments due to the complexity of the systems and incomplete information , the mathematical models are usually formulated by modifying empirical equations or proposing heuristic equations .  embodiments although those models can disclose significant details of the system 's structure and dynamics , the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental results creates difficulties for control engineers to verify the models , develop optimal controls , and reconstruct systems with desired properties . in this paper  embodiments , we use a novel approach to build up abstract mathematical models at the molecular level in section 2.2 , based directly on biological theory . with reasonable assumptions  embodiments we use a novel approach to build up abstract mathematical models at the molecular level in section 2.2 , based directly on biological theory . with reasonable assumptions  embodiments we use a novel approach to build up abstract mathematical models at the molecular level in section 2.2 , based directly on biological theory . with reasonable assumptions  embodiments the central dogma of molecular biology , focusing on a gene or changes in chemical concentration , we emphasize the base change in the nucleotide bases .  embodiments the cost function , a summation of costs for applying mutagens and the off -

opening � , � the intramolecular ring closure will be much faster for a such 1,3-bridged � dioxanylium ion intermediate than addition of water . � although in principal , the orthobenzoate cage could also be opened � to give dioxanylium ions bridged between o-5 and o-1/3 of the inositol � ring in the initial stage of acid hydrolysis , only 1/3-o -

further complicating this situation is the fact that the time frame over which hyperoxic that mitochondrial dysfunction is a cardinal feature of hyperoxic lung injury . although much work has been done in cell cultures and tissue homogenates , studies probing key tissue mitochondrial functions and the effect of oxidant injury in intact lungs in real - time are limited , , . because indices of mitochondrial function of in situ tissue are often different than those of tissue homogenates , measurements of indices of oxidative phosphorylation in intact tissue for comparison to those of isolated mitochondria are important . \u001c recently , we demonstrated the utility of optical fluorometry ( fig .  1 ) to detect a change in the redox status of lung mitochondrial autofluorescent

      "generated": "ersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking are central ideas both in contemporary particle physics and in mathematical physics . in this paper, we argue that for a large new class of d - brane models there exists a simple geometric criterion which determines whether supersymmetry breaking occurs . embodimentsthe models of interest are based on calabi - yau singularities with d - branes placed at or near the singularity . by taking a large volume limit , it is possible to decouple gravity from the theory , and ignore the calabi - yau geometry far from the branes . embodimentsalthough one typically begins the construction with branes free to move throughout the calabi - yau space , many interesting theories include fractional branes ( or wrapped branes ) , which are d - branes stuck at the singularity and which can not move away from it . embodimentsthese fractional branes can lead to topology changes in the geometry via gaugino condensation , which can be understood in terms of deformations of the complex structure of the calabi - yau space , and result in the replacement of branes by fluxes @xcite . embodimentsthese fractional branes ( or wrapped branes ) , which are d - branes stuck at the singularity y is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry ,the deformation obstruction causes the breaking . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry ,the deformation obstruction causes the breaking . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry ,the susy - bog adds a new feature to the string theory landscape . subur@xmath1 belongs to a large class of singularities for which this geometric obstruction is easy to understand . suburwe need the technical concept from algebraic geometry of a singularity which is an `` incomplete intersection variety . '' suburthese varieties are described by @xmath4 equations in @xmath5 variables , where the dimension of the variety is strictly greater than @xmath6 . although the @xmath4 equations or relations are redundant , it is impossible to reduce the number of equations further without changing the geometry . in the case of an incomplete intersection , the @xmath4 equations or relations are redundant , it is impossible to reduce the number of equations further without changing the geometry . in the case of an incomplete intersection ,the redundancy makes it hard to deform the equations consistently , giving an obstruction to de a stack of @xmath7 d3-branes and @xmath8 d5-branes at the tip of the conifold : _¯¯¯¯i=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 = 0  . practition[ coneq ] the d5-branes are fractional . in the supergravity solution , the d5 - branes are fractional .the d - branes are replaced by their corresponding rr five - form and three - form fluxes .in the supergravity solution ,the three - form flux from the d5-branes leads to a singularity unless the conifold is deformed : _¯¯¯¯i=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 =  . practition[ coneqdef ] this @xmath9 parameter is interpreted as a gaugino condensate in the dual theory and breaks the r - symmetry to @xmath10 . in the dual theory of @xmath1 , the conifold is interpreted as a conifold with no r - symmetry to @xmath10 .in the dual theory of @xmath1 , the conifold is interpreted as a conifold with no r - symmetry to @xmath10 .in the dual theory of @ 16 sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite . using the explicit metric , sasaki - einstein manifolds were found in @xcite .impressive comparisons of the conformal anomaly coefficients and r - charges between the ads and the cft sides were carried out for @xmath1 in @xcite .    as was the case for the conifold , adding d5-branes to the tip of the cone over @xmath1 breaks conformal invariance and leads to a cascading gauge theory @xcite . recently , a supergravity solution dual to this cascading theory was derived by herzog , ejaz , and klebanov ( hek ) @xcite .the ks solution shares many of the features of the predecessor of the ks solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution @xcite . like the kt solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution is singular in the infrared ( small radius ) ; at large radius , in the ultraviolet , the kt solution approaches the ks solution .the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution is singular in the supersymmetry . hypotheswe have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along the baryonic branch , but the argument is not as rigorous as the konishi anomaly approach . it may be that there exists a supersymmetric , pure flux supergravity solution ( which does not involve a calabi - yau manifold ) , similar to the recent @xmath17 structure solutions of @xcite . recall that the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch of the conifold field theory @xcite . as one moves along the baryonic branch , one finds that the geometry is no longer calabi - yau but is instead an @xmath17 structure solution where probe d3-branes break supersymmetry .    for generic initial number of d3- and d5-branes at the bottom of the cascade . hypotheswe expect to have left - over d3-branes at the bottom of the cascade . hypothesthe ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch where these d3-branes will remain supersymmetric . hypotheshowever , even if there is an @xmath17 structure solution for @xmath1 , the left - over 2 v^- _ iral primary operator as a representative of a class of operators related by the f - term equations . by only giving a single trace over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver, we are really specifying a class of such operators related to each other by the f - term equations .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there are six types of operators that loop just once around the quiver @xmath36 u_r^z u_l^y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^v^  . from these six building blocks , we can form any operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\now of these six building blocks , only three are independent .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\note that from ( [ v ] ) , @xmath37 and that @xmath38 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\moreover , under ( [ ur ] ) , @xmath39 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we will choose the three independent blocks u_r^y block ] ) is symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,we conclude that the most general operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) takes the schematic form ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j z u_l^_i y_3 ) ) [ ch1 ] or ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j y_2 y_3 ) ) [ ch1 ] or ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j z u_l^_j v^_j ) )  . [ ch2 ] and [ ch3 ] ,these operators are understood to be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,we conclude thatthe first operator transforms in a @xmath43 dimensional representation of @xmath and as well as commuting by construction, we can construct any operator of the form ( [ ch1 ] ) or ( [ ch2 ] ) subject to some relations . in particular , we know that the resulting operator must be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices and moreover an @xmath47 and @xmath48 type operator annihilate to form two @xmath49 operators ( [ annihilation ] ) . in particular , we know that the resulting operator must be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices and moreover an @xmath47 , @xmath48 type operator annihilate to form two @xmath49 operators ( [ annihilation ] ) . in particular , we know that the operator must be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices and moreoverthe set of twenty relations these operators satisfy is given in appendix a.    we can find a set of monomials with identical algebraic properties . in particular , we let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and    ccc    c a_1 = x^2 y + a_2 = x^2 z    ,    c b_1 = x y^2 + b_ . 神we call this moduli space the mesonic branch of the theory . that we have found a calabi - yau in this way is in line with the expectations of reverse geometric engineering @xcite .    now , treating @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 as homogenous coordinates on @xmath58 , this set of monomials can be reinterpreted as a set of linearly independent polynomials on @xmath19 which vanish at the point @xmath59 for @xmath60 . this set of monomials then provides a map from @xmath61 with the point @xmath62 missing because the origin is not contained in @xmath63 . 神the smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 . 神the smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 . 神the smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath19 blown up at a xmath77 certainly contains the image of the map described above from @xmath61 .    using the twelve monomials that depend on the @xmath72 and @xmath72 , we can also describe the extra blown up @xmath67 in @xmath1 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\consider the case @xmath78 and @xmath79 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\now , the @xmath72 are unconstrained , and the only two nonvanishing monomials in the @xmath71 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which parametrize the blown up @xmath67 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\naively , this description of the first del pezzo seems overly complicated .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\for example , we may just as easily consider the simpler segre map to @xmath82 : @xmath83 subject to the relation @xmath84 we have a simpler embedding of the first del pezzo inside @xmath85 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , we are not just describing the geometry of the del -

charges of all of the fermions in the gauge theory . for the @xmath24 case embodiments, it is indeed possible to maximize @xmath47 over the two parameter family of solutions , and one can match the results to geometric expectations @xcite . embodimentshowever , in have an infinite number of troublesome operators , and truncating them from the theory will radically change the geometry .    the theory is a simpler and we believe more probable resolution to this pair of problems a simpler and we believe more probable resolution to this pair of problems  an inability to maximize @xmath47 and an infinite set of operators below the unitarity bound  is that the corresponding superconformal fixed point does not exist .    at the beginning of our analysis, we assumed an su(2 ) symmetry . if we allow this su(2 ) to be broken , we can maximize @xmath47 but there will still be an infinite number of operators with negative conformal dimension .    we begin by analyzing the theory with no d3-branes and @xmath7 d5-branes .    the theory with no d3-branes and @xmath7 d5-branes .   such a gauge theory can be thought of as the last step in the seiberg duality cascade , starting in the uv with a multiple @xmath102 of d3-branes .   starting with the pure d5-brane theory precludes the possibility of a rotations to this field it is always possible to eliminate components of the field such that the contracted form is diagonal and nonvanishing only on @xmath111 of its @xmath112 diagonal components , inconsistent with the d -

      "reference": "source confusion has been a long - standing problem in the astronomical history . in the previous formulation of the confusion problem , sources are assumed to be distributed homogeneously on the sky . this fundamental assumption is , however , not realistic in many applications . in this work , by making use of the point field theory , we derive general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . as a typical example , we apply these new formulae to the source confusion of infrared galaxies . we first calculate the confusion statistics for power - law galaxy number counts as a test case . when the slope of differential number counts , @xmath0 , is steep , the confusion limits becomes much brighter and the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation field is strongly distorted . then we estimate the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model for infrared galaxies . the gradual flattening of the slope of the source counts makes the clustering effect rather mild . clustering effects result in an increase of the limiting flux density with @xmath1% . in this case , the peak probability of the pdf decreases up to @xmath2 % and its tail becomes heavier . though the effects are relatively small , they will be strong enough to affect the estimation of galaxy evolution from number count or fluctuation statistics . we also comment on future submillimeter observations .",

north provides more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes , and also gives optical - to - infrared colors .    in paper #1 of the lspm - north , we demonstrated the potential for using the superblink database to find new cpm companions , reporting the discovery of 5 new companions of known nearby stars @xcite . in this second paper , we capitalize on the very high motions , although there remains a small probability that a few will , by chance , also have similar proper motions ( although they may lie at very different distances ) . Additionally,the formal identification of a cpm pair as a wide binary thus requires one to weight in the probability for a common proper motion pair to be a chance alignment . Additionally,consider two stars at angular positions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 refers to the right ascension and @xmath47 to the declination on the sky . Additionally,these stars have proper motions @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for small angles of separation between stars 1 and 2 , we can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can also define @xmath52 as the magnitude of the difference between the proper motion vectors : @xmath53 each pair can thus be represented in a ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space . for large numbers of pairs , one can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can also define @xmath52 as the 1 with positions @xmath44 , and set # 2 with positions @xmath45 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we calculate the angular distance separating each individual object in set # 2 from each individual object in set # 1 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\assuming there are @xmath55 objects in set # 1 and @xmath56 objects in set # 2 , then we have @xmath57 pairings .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\what we are interested in is the special case where the primary star is a _ hipparcos _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ after the move , then we would have a good estimate of how many married couples are attending the dance .the distribution of all pairs in the @xmath60,@xmath52 thus effectively simulates a distribution of pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_.the distribution of all pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_. the displacement angle @xmath59 should be large enough that all cpm doubles are well separated , i.e. , larger than the typical angular separation between cpm pairs .the displacement angle @xmath59 should not be too large because we need to simulate pairing made within areas of the sky that have similar densities and proper motion systematics .the displacement angle @xmath59 should not be too large because we need to simulate pairing made within areas of the sky that have similar densities and proper motion systematics .the distribution of all pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_.the distribution of all pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_.the distribution of all pairs in the lsp the cpm doubles .

Additionally,based on our simulations of chance alignments , we estimate the contamination in the entire search area to be @xmath94 pairs , or @xmath95 of the total sample . embodimentsusing the selection method discussed above , we searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm binaries in which both the primary and secondary ( and tertiary ) are _ hipparcos _ stars . embodimentswe identified a total of 168 such cpm pairs with angular separations @xmath96 , arranged into 158 doubles and 5 triples . embodimentsfigure 3 shows the distribution in @xmath73 for the 163 systems selected as most likely to be wide binaries / multiples ( open and filled circles ) . embodimentsfig.3 also shows the @xmath73 distribution of pairs that did not fall within our selection limits , and thus identified as most likely to be chance alignments ( open and filled triangles ) . embodimentsthese pairs of _ hipparcos _ stars make an excellent case study for our wide binary search algorithm because the _ hipparcos _ catalog provides accurate and independent measurements of their parallaxes , which allow us to verify if the two components indeed physically associated . embodimentsfig.3 also the first star has a _ hipparcos _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ between the two components ( @xmath113 ) raises suspicion about their physical association , but the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are a near perfect match , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .it is interesting to note that the 2 genuine doubles found among the 55 pairs that were initially rejected suggest that a few percent of the pairs rejected in our search algorithm are likely to be true doubles .at a distance of 44.5pcthis emphasizes the limitations of our statistical method in making a complete identification of wide cpm doubles , especially of those with very large angular separations . \"the primary is listed in table 1 ,the secondary is listed in table 1 ,the secondary is listed in table 1 ,the secondary is listed in table 1 ,the the triples all consist of one short separation pair with an additional component at larger separations . nominethe short separation pair is listed in table 1 . nominethe large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair . nomineeach triple is thus referenced as one short period pair and one long period pair . nominewe find that of the 158 doubles and 5 triples reported here , only 80 of the doubles ( and none of the triples ) had been previously reported in gc04 . nominea little more than half the systems in our list are thus classified as `` new '' cpm systems . nomineusing again the method described in  2 , we the searched the lspm -

magnitude diagrams for the primaries ( top ) , the close @xmath123 secondaries ( middle ) , and the wide @xmath124 secondaries ( bottom ) .the figure also plots in diagrams in two separate columns , comparing the pairs with _ hipparcos _ secondaries from  2 ( left ) with the pairs with non- _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( right ) .the figure also plots in diagrams in two separate columns , comparing the pairs with _ hipparcos _ secondaries from  2 ( left ) with the pairs with non- _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( right ) .when we look at the number of secondaries in the @xmath123-overall , we find that the majority of the secondaries fall close to either the main sequence or the white dwarf cooling sequence .the _ hipparcos _secondaries from  2 ( upper right in the diagram ) as determined from a fit of nearby stars with known trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .the _ hipparcos _secondaries from  2 ( upper right in the diagram magnitude outliers , we find that the close secondaries are on average 0.11 mag below the main sequence with a dispersion of 1.33 mag . Conversely,companions with @xmath124 have a mean offset of 0.05 mag with a significantly smaller dispersion of only 0.45 mag .attributewe conclude that the colors and magnitudes of the short separation pairs ( @xmath123 ) are not reliable enough to be useful for a photometric distance comparison . for the large separation pairs ( @xmath124 ) , however , the colors and magnitudes are accurate enough to use the photometric distance of the secondary as a confirmation that the two components are physically related .attributewe conclude that several of the wide secondaries do fail the test .attributethe lower -

north , we found one ( with hip 102040 as the primary ) that has a proper motion difference @xmath144 mas yr@xmath1 in the rnltt , which places it just outside of the selection range used in gc04 ( @xmath145 ) . nominethe lspm - north proper motions yield a @xmath146 mas yr@xmath1 for that the gc04 pairs , and adds a significant number of new objects . suburthe improvement clearly comes from the use of the more complete lspm - north catalog . suburgiven the very high estimated completeness of the lspm - north , we are confident that we have now identified virtually _ all _ existing companions of _ hipparcos _ stars within a relatively large range of angular separations , and down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 . suburwe have determined in  4.3 that our census is statistically ( @xmath38 ) complete up to angular separations @xmath143 . suburthe survey also has a limit at small angular separations . suburthe large apparent magnitude of the _ hipparcos _ primaries and their deep saturation on photographic survey plates hampers our detection of companions with small angular separations . since the lspm - north is based on analyses of digitized sky survey scans of poss - i and poss - ii , this is a severe limitation because _ hipparcos _ stars are deeply saturated on poss - i plates . for pairs where only one component is a _ hipparcos _ primarystar , we should be able to see companions only for angular separations @xmath149 . suburthe large apparent magnitude verse velocities and angular separationsare increasingly left out of the sample at larger distances @xcite . suburthe number of detected systems hence reaches a maximum around @xmath154 pc . suburwhat is also apparent in fig.7 is the dominance of pairs @xmath155 in the hip+hip systems . suburin contrast , pairs for which only the primary is a _ hipparcos _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ clearly dominated by stars with @xmath168 , in other words by m dwarfs . 神since most of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are g dwarfs , with @xmath169 , it is clear that there is no general tendency for the secondaries to be of similar masses as their primaries . 神the secondaries , in fact , look like they could have been drawn from the field population of single stars ( see however  5.3 below ) .    the magnitude limit of the lspm - north catalog yields a limiting absolute magnitude which is dependent on the distance of the pair . 神the majority of our pairs are relatively close ; if we restrict our sample to objects within @xmath7 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be complete down to @xmath170 . 神this happens to be just beyond the peak in the luminosity function of low - mass red dwarfs @xcite . 神assuming the luminosity function of the secondaries to be roughly similar to that of field stars , then our census should be missing only a relatively small fraction of the hydrogen - burning secondaries . in any case, if we restrict our sample to objects within @xmath7 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be is correlated with mass , the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as cpm secondaries than they are in the field population . of the _ projected _ , orbital separation between the pairs @xmath180 , with @xmath158 expressed in au . suburnote that @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the actual orbital separation between the components and @xmath183 the orbital inclination . suburwhile @xmath182 is the physically meaningful quantity , we only have @xmath158 as the observable . suburwe separate our sample into bins of 0.2 in @xmath180 . suburwe calculate the multiplicity fraction for each bin by taking the ratio of wide binaries found in that bin to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars which satisfy the distance detection limits for that bin , based on a range of angular separations @xmath184 . for instance , the @xmath185 bin can only comprise systems with distances between 1.4pc and 62.9pc ( see fig 7 ) . the resulting wide binary frequency distribution is shown in figure 10 . suburour results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with separations @xmath187 au . suburour results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with total multiplicity fraction @xmath198 , which is much larger than the total binary fraction estimated by @xcite . we take this as evidence that this particular form is inadequate in the range of orbital separations under consideration .///////////////////////////////our second attempt to modelize the distribution of orbital separations uses a power - law of the form : @xmath199 given that the mean projected separation in a sample of systems with random orbital plane orientations is @xmath200 , then statistically the distribution in projected separations @xmath158 also follows : @xmath201 if we plot the distribution along @xmath180 we have : @xmath202 the specific form of the equation for which @xmath36 is the well - known _ pik s law _ , and yields a distribution which is uniform in @xmath180 .///////////////////////////////we find that our data can be consistently modeled with two distinct power - law distributions over two separate ranges of orbital separations ( fig.10 , model b ) . at small projected separations , at large projected separations , at large projected separations , at large projected separations , at small projected separations , at small projected separations , at small projected separations , at small projected separations , census of wide binary systems , which would yield a more detailed distribution of orbital separations , might shed more light on the processes at work in hampering the formation of extremely wide pairs . suburwe have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of the lspm -

luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population . suburmost of the _ hipparcos distribution of orbital separations remain relatively crude .    a more detailed analysis of the binary frequency , which holds the promise to provide stringent constraints on multiple star formation models , will require much larger samples of cpm pairs .    a more detailed analysis of the binary frequency , which holds the promise to provide stringent constraints on multiple star formation models , will require much larger samples of cpm pairs .    a more detailed analysis of the binary frequency , which holds the promise to provide stringent constraints on multiple star formation models , will require much larger samples of cpm pairs .    at this time , we plan to first expand our census to the southern hemisphere using the upcoming lspm -

driven phase transition at late times . also , the vacuum field could be trapped at the origin , as in the case of thermal inflation , resulting in a thermal signature in the spectrum , e. in this letter we propose a new mechanism to produce dark radiation .<n> the mechanism is based on the phase transition between dark radiation and dark matter , where the vacuum energy of a massive particle is converted to dark radiation at a certain time . in this case<n> the radiation can be observed as a dip in the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum around @xmath0 , which could be a smoking -

photon decays of a light higgs boson into a pair of photons , @xmath0 .<n> we find that , in the case where the higgs decays into a photon and a lepton , the energy density carried by the photon in a comoving volume is proportional to the inverse photon - lepton cross section . in the opposite case ,<n> when the decay into photons is forbidden by the vacuum expectation value of the photopion field , then the density of photons in the vacuum will be smaller than the vacuum density . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of a fermion field @xcite , which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . for a long time<n> it has been believed that the lsp should decay into leptons , but this was never confirmed experimentally . recently<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of lepton decays , mainly because of the recent discovery of the baryon asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @x<n> . also , it is we study the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum resulting from the decay of dark radiation .<n> we find that the gw spectrum has a line shape , which may be realized in some models motivated by particle physics . <n> _ introduction. _ gravitational waves produced in the early universe may have originated from a variety of sources , such as scalar - field driven inflation @xcite , primordial black - hole and pulsar accelerations , type ia and type ii supernovae , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe . in the past decade<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in the possibility that these gravitational waves may have a physical origin , e.g. , dark matter ( dm ) or dark energy ( de ) in the form of a supersymmetric ( susy ) black hole @xmath0 , a fermionic or bosonic scalar field , or a combination of the two . to search for these sources<n> is one of the main goals of the current generation of gravitational wave detectors , including the lisa , ligo , virgo  we study the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum resulting from the decays of dark radiation which dominate the visible sector of the universe .<n> we find that the gw spectrum has a hill around @xmath0 due to the short mean free path of the dark radiation . <n> _ introduction _ gravitational waves are waves which travel with the speed of light and carry a significant amount of energy . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , gravitons are the lightest supersymmetric particles , which are predicted to be neutralino - like bosons @xcite . recently ,<n> the observation of gravitational waves from two types of sources , namely , type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and type ib / c supernovae , has opened a new window to the physics beyond the sm . for the first time , we have a chance to observe the physics of dark matter ( dm ) which is the main component of the present universe : the dm is the most abundant component in the universe and it is responsible for the acceleration of the expansion . as a result<n> , it has been suggested that the universe is dominated by a mysterious component we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation , which is a brief period of thermal inflation caused by a scalar field .<n> we consider two cases : 1 . a period of inflation is caused by the scalar field @xmath0 , and 2 . after the phase transition ,<n> the field decays instantaneously into dark radiation @xcite . in the case 1<n> , the gw spectrum is known to be strongly suppressed due to the anisotropic stress caused by dark radiation . here , we show that the suppression is much weaker and the result is almost the same as the case of the thermal inflation . for the case 2 , on the other hand , there is a dip in the spectrum around the frequency of the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect caused by visible radiation , instead of the hill seen in the previous case . <n> _ introduction _ the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , whose energy density is proportional to the energy density of the universe . however , dm does not dominate the universe in all cases , except for the inflationary scenario we study the effect of anisotropic stress on gravitational waves ( gws ) generated in a phase transition driven by a scalar field .<n> we find that the resulting gw spectrum shows oscillatory behavior with its amplitude depending on the frequency . for a short period of thermal inflation ,<n> the amplitude of the gw mode with frequency @xmath0 is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the case with late - time entropy production . in the low frequency limit , however , the suppression is less efficient due to the decay of the coherent oscillation into dark radiation . <n> gravitational waves @xcite have been measured by many experiments , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the large - scale structure ( lss)@xcite , as well as by the detection of gravitational waves from the sun and from nearby galaxies . the main goal of these experiments is to search for signals of dark matter , which is the main component of the energy budget of the universe , and to constrain the nature of dark energy , its equation of state , or the mass of the dark matter particles . to this end<n> , it is of great importance to understand in this paper , we propose a new scenario for the origin of dark matter . in this scenario ,<n> dark radiation is produced by a coherent oscillation during a short period of thermal inflation , and then the radiation is diluted by the subsequent matter domination .<n> we show that some particle -

breaking ( susb ) or extra dimensions ( extra dimensions ) @xcite . among them , the susy pq model is one of the most attractive since it gives a natural explanation of the origin of the we have studied various effects of the cosmological events in the early universe on the inflationary gw spectrum . in particular , we have shown that the thermal inflation caused by the vacuum energy of the right - handed neutrino , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism , does not thermalize because of the weakness of the interaction of the majoron sector . next , a susy majoron model is considered .<n> this u(1 ) symmetry breaking may be identified as a gauged @xmath0 symmetry , or it can be global lepton number symmetry . then a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson appears which is associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the u(1)-symmetry . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we have assumed that the cosmological evolution goes as follows : ( i ) after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of the baryons and antibaryons quickly decays into the smajoron sector particles , ( ii ) the coherent oscillation of these particles dominates the universe after the temperature decreases to zero , and ( iii ) this dilutes about one - half of the dark radiation . here<n> we take the following parameters we study the susy majoron model and its cosmological implications on the inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> we focus on the phase transition of the right - handed neutrinos from the weak to the strong interaction scale , which might take place in the early universe . in this model ,<n> the smajoron acquires a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and decays coherently into sfermions , neutrinos , and antineutrinos . as a result<n> , the universe undergoes a phase transition from a cold dark matter ( cdm ) phase to a hot dark one ( htd ) which is driven by the coherent oscillation of the majoron sector , followed by a transition to a radiation - dominated universe , in which a large fraction of the present dark energy ( @xmath0 ) is radiated away . <n> the inflationary phase transition ( i.e. , cosmological phase transition ) of the cdm is one of the most studied topics in cosmology @xcite , since it is believed to be the origin of the dark energy , as well as of the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the dark matter . we study the spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> in particular , we calculate the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath0 of the amplitudes of gw perturbations in the md and rd eras . in the rd era ,<n> the gw amplitudes are proportional to the amplitude of the primordial perturbations , and hence the spectrum has a non - trivial dependence on the scale factor at which the mode enters the horizon . as a result , in the inflationary era the spectrum is non - perturbative . for the md era<n> , the spectrum can be non - oscillatory , while in the inflation era it can be oscillatory with a high frequency , which is within the reach of future space - based gw detectors . <n> inflation is one of the simplest and most promising candidates for explaining the origin of the energy density of the universe . at present , though , it is not the only option @xcite . among the many other possibilities , there is a class of models which predict the existence of a phase transition between a radiation - dominated and an inflationary - dominated universe , known as the quintessence phase transition ( pq  we study the cosmological evolution of the effective energy density of gravitational waves ( gws ) , and its dependence on the wavenumber of the mode entering the horizon .<n> we show that , in the case of radiatively driven inflation , the inflationary gw energy density is proportional to the square of the hubble parameter at the time of horizon exit . as a result ,<n> the amplitude of the gw spectrum is suppressed , which leads to a suppression of the cmb anisotropy signal at large angular scales . <n> the primordial cmb energy density @xmath0 at the present epoch is comparable to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) energy density at the observable epoch , i.e. , it is the same order of magnitude as the energy density in the early universe @xcite . however , due to the large variation of the primordial energy density as a function of time , this energy density can not be explained by the gravitational wave signal of the universe , since it was produced by the inflaton field at the epoch of recombination (  recombination '' ) of the nucleons . in order to account for the observed large scale structure of our universe if the universe is filled with perfect fluid at the present epoch , gravitational waves ( gws ) of different wavenumbers exit the horizon at different epochs .<n> we show that the effective energy density of inflationary , subhorizon , dispersive , long - wavelength modes is proportional to the hubble parameter at the time of horizon exit , which implies that the present gw spectrum is almost flat . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) ,<n> if the equation of state is @xmath0 , the present value of the effective gw energy density is equal to that at the planck scale , and the wavenumber of the first gw to enter the horizon @xcite . <n> the observation of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by wmap and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite provide strong evidence for the existence of a non - vanishing cosmological term in the form of an effective gravitational constant . if the cosmological term originates from the vacuum energy of a phase transition in the early universe ( @x we study the gravitational waves ( gws ) from the onset of thermal inflation to the phase transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we show that the gw spectrum is proportional to the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 in the intermediate frequency region , and that the mode with wavenumber at the horizon exits the horizon at the end of the thermal inflation era . <n> _ introduction _ the observation of gravitational waves @xcite is one of the most important cosmological tests for the nature of the vacuum energy in the early universe . in the standard model of particle physics ,<n> gravitational waves are considered to be generated by the vacuum fluctuations of the gravitational potential . during inflation , the energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )<n> is driven to a high value , resulting in the formation of the large scale structure of the universe , i.e. , an accelerating expansion . at the same time , in the inflationary epoch , a tiny amount of radiation is generated , which is called the primordial curvature perturbation (  primordial gw ) and plays an important role in the dynamics of the accelerated expansion : it is responsible we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from thermal inflation , and show that the gw spectrum has oscillatory features at intermediate frequencies , which is not seen in conventional models .<n> we argue that the oscillatory feature originates from the  horizon entry '' process of the modes with wavenumber @xmath0 at the phase transition , where the vacuum energy immediately goes to radiation . in the short - wavelength limit<n> , the _ spectral index _ of the graviton depends on the ratio of the energy density of vacuum energy to that of matter in the universe at the epoch of thermal inflation ( or at the transition to the radiation - dominated era ) . as a result , in the intermediate frequency region , it is given by the value of the spectral index of gravitons , i.e. , we have the sachs - wolfe effect ( swe ) @xcite . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in gw phenomena from quantum gravity ( qg ) point of view , as well as from a theoretical viewpoint . from the qg viewpoint , one of the most interesting phenomena is _ gravitational wave we study gravitational waves ( gws ) produced by thermal inflation in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( rdw ) universe before the phase transition to a radiation - dominated one .<n> we find that the gw spectrum has peaks at the horizon exit and troughs outside the horizon at the transition , which are caused by the oscillation of the modes with the period @xmath0 . in the case of rd dominated universe before thermal inflation ,<n> the oscillation peaks are located at the wavenumbers which are the same as those of the  horizon -

redshift type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @x , as well as large scale structure ( lss , see e.g. refs . we study the effect of gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation on the phase transition of the universe from a decelerating phase to a accelerating phase .<n> we show that the gw spectrum has two peaks , one at the transition and the other at the exit of the horizon , which are separated by @xmath0 at the critical point , where the universe begins to inflate . as a result<n> , the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations is significantly enhanced , and the ratio of the amplitudes of the two gw peaks is larger than unity . <n> inflation is one of the most fundamental phenomena in modern cosmology . during inflation ,<n> the energy density in the universe increases exponentially , resulting in the formation of large scale structure @xcite . at the same time , in the early stage of inflation ( called the inflationary epoch ) , a phase transition occurs , during which the universe starts to inflate and collapse . in this phase transition , radiation from the innermost region of the expanding universe<n> is accelerated by the gravitational field of the ambient medium , leading to the accelerated expansion of the early universe , called the cosmological constant ( cc)@xmath1 era . we propose a new class of dark energy models in which the universe is filled with a mixture of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and hot , dense baryonic matter . in these models ,<n> the transition from the cdm phase to the hot dark matter phase occurs at a scale much larger than the hubble radius , and the transition is continuous throughout the history of the universe .<n> we show that this scenario is consistent with recent observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) of nearby galaxies . <n> dark energy is one of the most promising candidates for explaining the origin of the energy density in the universe as well as other aspects of particle physics , such as supersymmetry , grand unified theories ( gut ) or supersymmetry - breaking ( susy - breaking ) @xcite . among them , a large variety of models have been proposed which are motivated by the idea that the universe may have a phase transition between a cold and a hot phase , which is a necessary condition for a successful string theory . at the phase transition , matter we study the effect of the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 on the formation of primordial black holes ( bhs ) .<n> we show that the eos of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) can give rise to primordial bhs with a mass of order 1 tev , provided that the energy density of the sm is sufficiently large compared to the critical density for reheating of the universe . in this case<n> , the primordial bh can be regarded as a quintessence ( qcd ) particle , which is indistinguishable from ordinary matter . <n> the primordial black hole ( bh ) plays an important role in astrophysics as a probe of the physics of the early universe @xcite . because the bh mass is proportional to the hubble parameter , it is expected that the mass of the bh will be much larger than that of the ordinary matter in order to suppress the radiation of the primordial density perturbations . on the other hand , due to the presence of the cosmological constant ( cmb ) and the radiation pressure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) at the early epoch ,<n> the bh masses are much smaller than the cmb we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be expressed as a sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the energy density of the universe and the other is a constant .<n> the former corresponds to the vacuum energy of the dark matter ( dm ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , while the latter corresponds to an eos of the dm interacting with the higgs field of the sm . as a result<n> , the curvature in the eos is determined by the sum of the curvatures in the two dm eoss , which are proportional to each other . <n> the curvature of the energy momentum tensor of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) plays an important role in determining the nature of the cosmological structure . in the early universe , when the temperature of the cmb is very low , it is due to the gravitational attraction between the cme plasma and dark matter . on the other hand , in the late universe when the hubble parameter is very large ,<n> when the density of dark matter is very high , this gravitational attraction can be compensated by the we study the effect of the cp violating phase @xmath0 in the lepton sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we show that the relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in this scenario is strongly dependent on the cp phase , which is sensitive to the value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the lsp in the early universe . as a result ,<n> the lsp relic abundance can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude with respect to that in the sm with the help of the relic sphaleron . <n> the discovery of the baryon asymmetry of the universe by the planck collaboration @xcite has been one of the most important progresses in particle physics during the last decade . in the framework of supersymmetric ( susy )<n> extensions of the sm , it is important to search for signals of new physics , such as leptons and neutrinos , in order to have a chance to explain the origin of the observed abundance of these particles . to this end<n> , various particle physics experiments have been carried out , including collider experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc  we propose a supersymmetric @xmath0 extension of the standard model ( sm ) that can explain the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe . in this model ,<n> the lightest neutrino is a dark matter particle , which decays into a pair of ordinary neutrinos .<n> the dark matter relic density is proportional to the squared of the higgs boson mass , and the ratio of these two masses is predicted to be equal to unity . as a result<n> , the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and the lightest higgs particle is a neutralino - antihiggsino particle ( axion - axion particle ) . <n> the observed abundance of the baryons in the universe @xcite is due to their decay products , i.e. , dark matter ( dm ) is a mixture of ordinary and exotic particles , such as quarks , leptons , photons , neutralinos , electrons , neutrinos and so forth . to explain the observed dm abundance , it is necessary to assume the existence of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles that couple to the dm particles through the yukawa we point out that , in a certain class of supersymmetric models , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate .<n> we consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a higgs doublet lsp decaying into a pair of dm particles . in this model ,<n> the lightest neutralino is the dm particle , and its mass is determined by the mass of the @xmath0 gauge boson , which decays into dm via the higgs mechanism . as a result , for a narrow range of the model parameters , there exists a region in the parameter space where the lightest cp -

transformation estimator suggested in @xcite and is , in particular , fully nonparametric in the sense that it does not require the data to be drawn from a prior distribution , nor does it depend on any prior assumption on the underlying copula . <n> the estimator is shown to be consistent in the presence of unbounded copulas , as well as in situations where other estimators fail . in the univariate case<n> , it is seen to be equivalent to the well - known gumbel model , while in the multivariate case it gives a much better fit to the data than the gumbel estimator , which is based only on the data . as a consequence ,<n> the proposed estimator has a much wider range of applicability than its univariate counterpart , and can be considered as a new , powerful tool for nonparametric modelling of multivariate normal models . *<n> ams subject classification : * 62g05 , 62g07 , 65c30 , 68w20 , 94a17 , 90c26 , a new kernel -

squared displacement . on the other hand , in the case of electrons moving in an euclidian space , it is well known that the in this note , we show that the empirical copula process based on genuine observations is , in fact , a bivariate uniform empirical process on @xmath0 $ ] , where the coefficients in the first term are given by the classical kernel smoothing theory , and the second term is given by a modulus - of - continuity relation .<n> this is in contrast to the gaussian empirical process @xcite , which is not a univariate uniform process , as it does not have a modulus of continuity . as a consequence ,<n> the estimators of the coefficients of the first two terms in the modulus ofcontinuity relation are not kernel - based . <n> empirical processes are one of the most important tools in statistics , being used to model a wide range of phenomena , including population , ecosystems , biological evolution , resource allocation , epidemics , population dynamics , etc . in the field of statistics<n> , the copula is a central tool , playing the role of a  model - parameter ' , by which one can model a given set of observations , based on the assumption that some of them are known , but some are unknown . for example in this paper , we study the bias of the log - likelihood function ( lf ) on @xmath0 $ ] , which is the unit interval between two observations .<n> this is done by studying the modulus of continuity of the empirical process that generates the lf and its second and third terms . <n> we show that , if the two observations are identical , then the second term is equal to the first term , while the third term is , in fact , the same as in the case of a single observation . as a consequence ,<n> we prove that the log likelihood can be written as the product of two terms , one of which is a gaussian process and the other is a log - normal process . from this result<n> , it follows that the true lf can be expressed in terms of only one term and that the bias can be estimated from this one term . in recent years , there has been a lot of interest in the statistical properties of data sets generated by a variety of sources , including , but not limited to , population , ecological , economical , technological , and social systems @xcite . for example , we present a new method for estimating the copula density of an empirical copula process .<n> the method is based on two simple empirical versions of the bernstein estimator , which we show to be asymptotically equivalent . <n> * key words : * copula estimation , copula processes , bernstein estimation . *<n> ams subject classification * 62g05 , 62g07 , 91b30 , 93e20 , 60g40 , 65c05 . in this paper<n> , we propose a new approach to the estimation of copula densities @xmath0 , based on the two -

invariant : for example , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) amplitude is very close to zero . as a result , it is natural to expect that the universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion in the past , followed by an epoch of decelerated expansion ( the so - called de sitter bounce ) . the we show that inflationary cosmology can be realized in the framework of bouncing universes , provided the initial scalar field has a nonvanishing kinetic energy at the bounce .<n> in particular , we find that a de sitter -

times . among these<n> are models of gravity coupled to matter fields , such as the standard model of electromagnetism , superconductors , we study the evolution of gravitational perturbations in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe filled with a single massive scalar field .<n> we show that the spectrum of the perturbations is determined by a single parameter , which can be related to the coupling of the scalar field to the matter perturbations . using this relation , we are able to approximate the spectrum in terms of the hubble parameter at the time of the big bang bounce and estimate the amplitude of the curvature perturbations at the bounce . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / + +<n> + + the standard big bang ( bbn ) bounce is a milestone in the history of the universe , marking the beginning of a cosmological phase of accelerated expansion @xcite . at the same time , it is believed to be preceded by a phase of radiation domination , _<n> i.e. _ a phase in which matter is expected to dominate . in the context of general relativity ( gr )<n> , this phase is usually referred to as the radiation dominated era ( rdpe ) . however , in recent years there has been increasing interest in we present a class of bouncing cosmological models in which the curvature of the spacetime at the time of the bounce is proportional to the square of the curvature at the bounce time .<n> we model this curvature by means of a bardeen - type equation of state , and show that it can give rise to the standard hot big bang singularity without the need for an additional phase of inflation , provided the scale factor is sufficiently large after the bounce . in this case<n> , there is no need to violate the null energy condition , which ensures that the curvature is negligible during the entire evolution of the universe . <n> the existence of a curvature singularity in the early universe is one of the most striking predictions of inflation @xcite . at the same time , it is believed to be a very rare event , being , in general , very difficult to detect due to the high sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to small deviations of the signal from the standard model ( sm ) expectation . to date , however , no observational evidence of such a singularity has been reported , although there are some hints of its existence in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . if the origin of the cmb we show that the time - dependent conformal ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation can be used to study the time evolution of quantum fluctuations .<n> in particular , we consider the case where the fluctuations are described by a bardeen - like equation , which is known to be in excellent agreement with the exact solution for the free scalar field in @xmath0 spatial dimensions . by means of a conformal bounce ,<n> we are able to obtain an analytical expression for the effective potential in terms of the scale factor and the conformal time . in this way<n> we can calculate the height and the position of the central peak and of the wings of the fluctuation spectrum . <n> conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite is a powerful tool in the study of the dynamics of quantum systems , as it allows one to investigate the time dependence of various physical quantities , such as , e.g. , the free energy of a system , or the spectrum of the fluctuations of a quantum field . as such<n> , it has been applied to a wide range of problems in physics , from cosmology to the foundations of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics . however  we study the effect of anisotropies in a scalar field potential on the propagation of gravitational waves .<n> we show that , in the case of an isotropic potential , the spectrum of the fluctuations is modified by the presence of a bounce , and that the height of the central peak and the position of the wings of the perturbations are modified as well . <n> gravitational waves ( gws ) are waves that propagate through space at a constant velocity @xmath0 . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> a gw is a massive scalar field with a negative quartic self - interaction @xcite . for a massless scalar field<n> , it can be interpreted as the gravitational potential of a black hole ( bh ) or a neutron star ( nw ) , with the bh acquiring a mass proportional to the square of the mass of the scalar field . as a result , gw <n> are schwarzschild black holes ( sbh ) with a positive mass squared , called planck - mass black holes , or pbhs . since the planck mass is proportional to a cosmological constant ( cmc ) @ we consider the interaction of a massive scalar field with a barrier and show that , for a wide range of couplings , this interaction generates a spectrum of modes with a well - defined shape . <n> pacs numbers : 11.27.+d , 11.10.lm , 98.80.cq 2 recently , there has been renewed interest in the problem of interacting massive fermions with a potential @xmath0 .<n> this potential , which arises from the interaction with a scalar field , has a number of attractive features : ( i ) it is piecewise symmetric , ( ii ) has a finite height , and ( iii ) can be made arbitrarily large by making a large number of small changes in the parameters of the theory . in this paper , we study these features in more detail and show how they can be exploited to generate a new type of interaction , the _ barrier potential _ ( bpm ) . here<n> , a barrier in the scalar field is represented by a piecewise potential which is a function of the wave number . for a given coupling ,<n> the bpm can be written as the product of two functions , one of we study the interaction of a wave packet with a one - dimensional barrier .<n> the wave packet interacts with the barrier only in the central part of the barrier and with the envelope of the packet in the outer part . in the limit of large barrier height<n> , we find that the interaction leads to the formation of a quasi - bound state , the shape of which depends on the parameters of the potential . <n> wave packets interacting with a potential barrier have been studied for a long time @xcite . for wave packets of length @xmath0 ,<n> the interaction with the potential is of the gaussian form , _<n> i.e. _ , a function of the position and the velocity of the wave . on the other hand , for short wave packets , such as those with the form of the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation ( sde ) , potential barriers<n> are usually of the piecewise - quadratic form . as a result , there is no bound state for a given wave packet , and there are no bound states for short - wavelength modes . however , this is no longer the case in the presence of an external potential  in this paper , we introduce a new class of one - dimensional potentials , the so - called _ parabolic models _ , which can be viewed as generalizations of the well - known _ isotropic heisenberg _ model .<n> these potentials are characterized by a single parameter , @xmath0 , and can be used to model a variety of physical systems , ranging from semiconductor quantum dots to biological cells . in this work ,<n> we show that the parabolic model can be regarded as a model for the isotropic version of the ising model in the presence of a magnetic field . <n> _ introduction. _<n> it has been known for a long time that the spin dynamics of a quantum dot ( qd ) in an external magnetic field can be described in terms of a one - parameter family of effective potentials @xcite , called hamiltonians . for a system in equilibrium<n> , these effective parameters can be related to the local magnetization by means of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theorem . however , in non - equilibrium situations , such as when the system is driven out of equilibrium , we show that a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type potential , interacting with a quantized magnetic field , can produce a non - zero net charge on the sample .<n> this is achieved by means of a nontrivial modification of the potential which gives rise to a net charge of the order of @xmath0 . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.-w , 03.30.+p , 05.45.mt the study of quantized conductance in semiconductor nanostructures has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the relation between the quantization of conductance and the behavior of the system in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition . for this purpose ,<n> it is of interest to calculate the quantum conductance of a system which is interacting with an external quantized field and then compare the results with those obtained for a system in contact with a quantum field . as shown in the present paper , a simple quantum mechanical model can be used to obtain the quantized and the classical conductance , respectively , as a function of the strength of the interaction and of the field s spectral distribution we study the spectrum of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic oscillator interacting with a bardeen - robertson - walker ( brw ) potential .<n> we show that , contrary to what one might expect , the spectrum is _ perfectly _ finite even in the limit of vanishingly small coupling to the oscillator s modes . as a consequence ,<n> the 1d oscillator can be used as a quantum simulator of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) . <n> the concept of qhe was introduced by bekenstein and hawking @xcite in order to describe the interaction of a single two - level system with an external electromagnetic field . in this context , it is natural to ask what happens to the spectrum when the electromagnetic field is turned off . for a 1d harmonic oscillator , this question is equivalent to the question of whether the spectrum propagates through a bounce or not , as it is the case in qhe and qcd for instance . here , we study this question in the case where the oscillator is 1d and the coupling to its modes is weak , and show that the resulting potential is singular in the sense that the spectrum does not propagate through the we study the effect of an external magnetic field on a bose - einstein condensate in an optical trap .<n> we show that the interaction between the condensate and the magnetic field leads to the formation of a condensate - vortex pair , which in the limit of zero magnetic field can be seen as a vortex - antivortex pair . in this limit ,<n> the spectrum of the system is determined by the interplay between the vortex pair and the external field . <n> the study of the interaction of a quantum system with an external field has a long history , going back to the work of bose and einstein . since then<n> , the field has been used to investigate a variety of systems , ranging from atoms to condensed matter systems @xcite . due to the large range of applicability of the field , it is not surprising that many studies of quantum field theory have been restricted to the case of one or a few particles . however , in the field of condensed matter , there is a growing interest in studying systems with more than two particles , _<n> i.e. _ interacting with a common field @xmath0 . for a system of two or more particles interacting with the same field we study the propagation of cosmological perturbations through a general relativistic bounce .<n> we find that the amplitude of the perturbation is proportional to the square root of the curvature of the scale factor , @xmath0 , and to the logarithm of the time when the bounce is approached , so that perturbations propagate with the same speed as light . for tensor modes ,<n> the propagation speed is inversely proportional to their spectral index . <n> pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 03.65.-w , 98.80.cq , 05.70.fh in recent years , a great deal of interest has been devoted to the study of perturbations in relativistic quantum mechanics ( rm ) . in particular , it has been realized that the usual perturbation theory , which is based on the einstein - hilbert action , breaks down in the presence of quantum gravity , leading to the so - called  quantum cosmology '' , _<n> i.e. _ a scenario in which matter and radiation behave as if they were homogeneous and at the same time are spatially separated from each other by a gap in the energy spectrum @xcite . as a result  we study the propagation of scalar and tensor perturbations in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background .<n> we show that , as one approaches a general relativistic bounce , the perturbation variables behave in a non - trivial way . in particular , they do not behave as canonically quantized , and diverge during the bounce . as a consequence ,<n> the curvature of the background space - time becomes non - negligible , which leads to a transition from a flat flrw universe to a de sitter - like universe . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.-k , 04.50.+h , 95.36.+x , 98.70.vc one of the most striking predictions of general relativity is the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . at the same time , there is a growing consensus that the standard model of cosmology , _<n> i.e. _ the flrw metric with a cosmological constant @xmath0 , is the appropriate choice for describing the early universe , since it provides the best fit to the present - day measurements of the hubble parameter and the angular size of the large scale structure we present a bouncing era scenario in which the standard model parameters are spontaneously broken by a gravitational wave .<n> the bounce is driven by the expansion parameter @xmath0 , which is proportional to the amplitude of the gravitational wave and to the square of the sound speed at the bounce , and it lasts for at least 10 billion years . at the end of the bounce the effective gravitational wave potential attains its maximum value and the system relaxes to a quasi - static equilibrium state . in this scenario ,<n> the tensorial modes of the cosmological perturbations are not affected by the bounce and , as a consequence , there is no back - reaction problem , in contrast to other known transitions . <n> there is a growing interest in the possibility that spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) may occur during the history of the universe @xcite . for instance , it has been suggested that this may be the mechanism responsible for the generation of primordial density perturbations , such as the cosmological microwave background ( cmb)@xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) fluctuations , or that it may be related to the so - called  cosmological constant problem '' @x<n> _ i we propose a scenario in which the universe undergoes a transition from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated era via a series of first - order phase transitions .<n> the transition is driven by the gravitational wave potential , which is dominated by the vacuum energy associated with the transition , and is preceded by a phase of quasi - exponential inflation followed by a period of radiation domination . in our scenario ,<n> the radiation - to - matter transition is of the second order , while the transition from radiation to matter takes place in the first order . <n> the standard cosmological scenario ( without a cosmological constant ) leads to a bouncing universe at late times ( @xmath0 ) , after which the expansion of the universe slows down and eventually stops @xcite . at the same time , the universe enters a new phase of accelerated expansion , dubbed the  cosmological constant era '' , during which this scenario is expected to be realized , provided that the parameters of the theory are suitably tuned @x<n> . however , there is no guarantee that the universe will enter this new era without experiencing a bounce . indeed , in the context of inflationary cosmology , it is well - known that the expansion parameter we study the evolution of primordial gravitational perturbations in the early universe during a phase of radiation domination followed by a transition to matter domination at late times .<n> we show that , contrary to the inflationary paradigm , the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations during the transition . <n> the standard picture of a cosmological bounce is based on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic . in reality , however , matter content is in the form of a scalar field , and the universe undergoes a phase transition to a hot big - bang space at a redshift @xmath0 @xcite . during this transition ,<n> the energy density in the scalar field is so small that it does not affect the gravitational potential of the system , but only affects the amplitude of the perturbations . as a result , _<n> i.e. _ , during the bounce , perturbations are not amplified at all , in contrast to what happens during an inflationary phase , where the amplification is controlled by the scale factor . at the same time , this leads to a nontrivial dependence of the spectrum on the size of the universe , which can be we study the evolution of scalar gravitational perturbations in the closed spatial section of a de sitter - like bouncing solution of einstein s equations .<n> we show that , contrary to what happens in the usual inflationary models , there is no  hubble crossing '' at the bounce : perturbations propagate in the same direction as they did in the pre - bounce phase and the amplitude of their spectral corrections is the same as in the case of no perturbations at all . in this context , the hubble scale is irrelevant and the potential @xmath0 is the relevant quantity , in contrast to the  horizon exit '' term often used in the context of semi - classical field theories . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 11.27.+d , 04.50.+h 2 in recent years , a lot of attention has been devoted to the study of the evolution and the spectral properties of primordial perturbations produced during a bouncing stage occurring in the early universe @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> a large body of work has been done in order to understand the structure of the perturbations generated during the pre big bang stage , as well as the spectral corrections to be expected at we construct a model of inflation in which the universe undergoes a short phase of expansion followed by a long period of contraction .<n> we show that the spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations is affected by this transition and that it leads to modifications of the tensor - to - scalar ratio and of the spectral index of curvature perturbations at the bounce . in the context of inflation @xcite , the idea that the universe underwent a short ( @xmath0 s ) phase of accelerated expansion followed , at least in principle , by a very long (  bounce '' ) contraction is very appealing , as it can be related to a number of well - known string - motivated models of the early universe , such as the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model , or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) brane - world models , among others . <n> the idea of inflation being based on a bounce , first proposed by tolman @x<n> .1 in , has recently received a lot of attention , in particular as a possible alternative to the standard big bang scenario , due to the possibility of having a stringy spectrum of primordial perturbations we discuss the evolution of gravitational wave perturbations in bouncing models of the universe , and show that the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation is the need for a high curvature phase , which may drastically modify the physical predictions . <n> there is mounting observational evidence for the existence of a non - vanishing gravitational wave spectrum .<n> this spectrum has been calculated in many models , including inflation @xcite , brane - world models @xmath0 , as well as extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) and extra dimensions , to name but a few . in all these models<n> it is believed that the primordial curvature perturbations will be dominated by the effects of string modes , _<n> i.e. _ by higher order string corrections to the effective action . however , there is no general argument preventing the perturbations from being dominated by these higher order corrections . here<n> we show that this is not the case , by explicitly constructing a bouncing model in which string corrections are not dominant . as a result<n> , the spectrum of perturbations can not be affected by propagating through a bounce , even in the case of inflation  we study the cosmological dynamics of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic frw background .<n> we show that the dynamics of the universe is determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy , which can be either positive or negative , depending on the value of the scale factor . for negative values , the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion , while for positive values it is in an expanding phase . <n> pacs number(s ) : 04.50.+h , 98.80.-k , 95.36.+x one of the most striking predictions of general relativity ( gr ) is the existence of a  cosmological constant '' , @xmath0 , and its possible violation , such as the cosmological neutrino problem @xcite . since the early days of gr , a large variety of models have been proposed to explain the large scale structure of the observable universe . among these models ,<n> the cosmological constant ( cc ) model is the most popular , since it is the only one able to fit all the observational data , including type ia supernova we present a general formalism for the study of the dynamics of black holes in string theory .<n> the formalism is based on the definition of black hole horizon as a black hole with horizon length @xmath0 times the string tension , and on the assumption that black holes can be treated as point masses in a string theory background . <n> black hole dynamics has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in particular , in the context of string theory<n> , it has been shown that black hole horizons can be described in terms of the classical trajectories of a classical black hole immersed in a gravitational potential , which is given by the string between the black hole and the rest of the world . the classical trajectory of such a string<n> is known to be determined by the classical equations of motion , but it is not known how to treat it as a point mass . on the other hand ,<n> black holes that are described by classical trajectories are not asymptotically flat , as they are in general not spherically symmetric . as a consequence , black hole solutions can not be asymptotically hyperbolic , i.e. , they do not have horizons . at the same time , string theory allows black",

1000 mhz and were used to determine the propagation velocity of the gw signal , which was measured with a fabry - perot interferometer ( fp - i ) at a spectral resolution of 100 mhz . <n> the results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions of gw - gw duality , as well as with the previously reported detections of high-@xmath1 gw signals from binary hics , making our work the first detection of a gw pair from a relativistic hic system . in relativistic binary systems ( rvbs ) ,<n> the particles are , in general , ultrarelativistic ( u , p , d , t)@xcite , and the gravitational wave ( ghz ) emission is proportional to the particle s kinetic energy @xcite<n> . we report on the measurement of the pulsation frequency of 4,6-di -

wide web , including the production of food and energy , the recycling of waste products , and the removal of material from the environment . however , there is also a problem with the use of oxygen in the treatment of lung diseases , where the mitochondria of the lung are we have developed a novel , non - invasive , fluorescence - based , fluorometer to detect oxygen toxicity in bovine serum albumin in vivo .<n> the device consists of a cylindrical , liquid - filled probe and a fiber bundle that measures the emission of fluorescent fluorophores as a function of time . by measuring the intensity of the emitted fluorescence<n> , we can determine the level of albumin toxicity in the system of interest . for lung studies ,<n> adult sprague - dawley rats were brought into contact with the chamber for 48 hours ( hyperoxic ) and then released from the plexiglass chamber at a rate of 3.5 liters / min . at the end of 48 hours , the chamber was cooled down to @xmath0c , and the fluorescence intensity was measured by a custom - made , custom - built , low - noise , high - resolution , time - resolved fluorescence detector . <n> the fluorometers developed in this work are expected to have applications in a wide range of scientific fields , including , but not limited to , biochemistry , biophysics , chemistry , epidemiology , environmental health , as well as homeland security . the manipulation of fluorescent fluorophores ( nadh and fad ) in rat lung tissue has been studied using a time - resolved fiber - optic system .<n> optical imaging was performed using fad and nadh , while fluorescence detection was performed with normoxic . in both cases ,<n> the output fluorescence intensity was found to be proportional to the duration of the exposure , with a power - law dependence on the exposure time . for fad , a power law dependence of the output intensity as a function of exposure time was observed , similar to what is observed in the optical imaging . <n> the ability to manipulate and detect fluorescent fluoroophores has been of great interest to biologists , chemists , and physicists for more than a century @xcite . over the last decade<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the use of fluorographs for optical imaging of biological systems , particularly in the study of lung tissue . to date , optical imaging has been performed on a variety of fluorescent species , including fluorescent xenon , fluorescent thiophene , fluorine , cyanopolyyne , gallium , sodium , potassium , calcium , sulfur , we describe a new non - invasive , all - optical method for mapping the internal structure of the human lung .<n> the method is based on a single - pass optical microscope , a fiber - optic probe , and an isolated perfused preparation of the lung , which allows for manipulation of lung redox state without disrupting the multi - cellular environment of the lungs through the addition of metabolic inhibitor(s ) to the recirculating perfusate and/or alteration of the composition of the ventilation gas . <n> optical imaging is one of the most important tools in the study of living systems , as it allows for the direct visualization of the internal structures of a host , from which one can infer its mechanical and chemical properties . in recent years<n> , optical imaging has been applied to a wide variety of situations , including , for example , the mapping of blood flow in capillaries @xcite , mapping the morphology of blood vessels in the course of a microfluidic experiment @xmath0 @x<n> ] , imaging the internal morphology of an animal with a microscope that is both non - destructive and sensitive to its own internal structure , such as a mouse , bird , snake , etc . @ * lung transplantation is a life - saving procedure .<n> however , there is a lack of experimental data that could guide clinical practice . here , we report a novel , state -

flow through the ventilation system , as well as increased the perfusion index of the system . * <n> the ability to monitor the state of a living organism at rest is of paramount importance in the field of biophysics . in particular<n> , it is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to the observed steady state , or state of equilibrium , of a system at rest @xcite . to this end , the perfusion of the heart , which controls the flow of blood throughout the body , is an important aspect in this work , we present the design and implementation of a new software package for in - vitro fertilization ( icf ) .<n> the software is based on the real - time , real - space , non - invasive algorithm for the detection and quantification of the erythrocytes in the bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) solution . <n> we demonstrate that our software can be used to perform in - situ fertilization at any position in the cow , with high efficiency , accuracy , and scalability . using this software ,<n> we have performed quantitative studies of the efficiency and accuracy of in - vivo icf detection for different concentrations of the bsa albumin , as well as different donors and conditions of the environment . in particular , our results show that the accuracy of the detection of the albumin concentration is comparable to that of the best state -

helmholtz ( kh ) instability , which is a non - linearity in the response of the lung to mechanical perturbations @xcite . as a result<n> , kh instability plays an important role in lung function , including the regulation of blood pressure , blood circulation , lung dynamics , wound healing , hyperoxic and normoxic pulsations in lungs were studied by means of time - resolved , pulsed - light imaging .<n> it was found that the activity of mitochondrial complex i , ii , iii , and iv , which are responsible for the pulsatile behavior , can be modulated by the addition of a small concentration of one or more of the following agents : rotenone , kcn , or pcp . for some of the lungs ,<n> pcp was added after the initial addition of rotenone or kcn to the recirculating perfusate . as a protonophore , pcp should oxidize the chain and hence decrease nadh signal and increase fad signal . <n> [ [ section ] ] there has been a growing interest in the use of pulsed light ( pl ) for the diagnosis of lung diseases @xcite . in spite of the fact that pl has been used for more than half a century , it is not yet fully understood the mechanisms responsible for its use . here<n> , we present a series of experiments to investigate the role of complex iv and/or complex ii inhibitions on the dynamics of pulsptile behavior in we report the first direct measurement of the activity of mitochondria complex i and ii in normallungs .<n> in contrast to previous work , no evidence was found for the presence of normoxic or hyperoxic mitochondria complexes in the activity spectrum of normal lungs , despite the fact that the activities of these two mitochondrial complexes are known to be involved in the normal functioning of the lung . in addition , we show that the fraction of time spent in each of these complexes is inversely proportional to the square of the mitochondria s activity level , as expected if the activity levels of the different mitochondria in the lung are coupled . <n> mitochondria are the building blocks of all living organisms , and their activity determines the health of the organism . despite their importance , however , there is currently no consensus on the mechanisms by which mitochondria organize their energy into the different components that make up their activity . to date , most experimental and theoretical studies of mitochondria activity have focused on mitochondria i , which is responsible for the production of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , the main nucleotide in the synthesis of @xmath0si , in the absence of any other chemical agents . for mitochondria ii ,<n> the nucleotides * background : * in lung fibrosis , a variety of signaling pathways are involved , leading to a complex interplay of cellular signaling , transcription , and signaling networks .<n> * methods :* in this paper , we investigate the role of complex signaling networks in the regulation of lung fibrosis using data from lung homogenates . <n> * results : _ ( i ) _ we show that the phosphorylation of complex ii ( succinate -

damaged proteins and less able to effectively transport heat and chemical energy . as a result , mitochondria can no longer supply the energy required to maintain a steady state in the presence of a given amount of chemical exposure , a process known as  damage control '' . <n> damage control is an important aspect of industrial and medical design , since it determines the functionality of devices and controls their performance and longevity @xcite . while the mechanisms of damage are not well understood , it is generally believed that damage control should be based on the principles of energy , heat , or matter , rather than on specific properties of the material , such as its composition , structure , hyperoxic injury is one of the most common non -

bog . in the supergravity paradigm ,<n> the breaking is due to a calabi - yau deformation of the six dimensional transverse space , which is the case in the standard model ( sm ) and in string theory , as well as in gauge theories beyond the sm , such as string theory with we construct a supersymmetric gravity solution for the cone over @xmath0 .<n> this solution is obtained by adding a first order complex structure deformation to the ks solution of @xcite . in the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) ,<n> the cone of deformations over the riemann surface , which includes the gravitino cone , is called the  supergravity cone '' . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) was introduced to solve the hierarchy problem of the electroweak scale . at the gut scale<n> , susy predicts the existence of a superpartner , a neutralino , and a higgs boson , the so - called  susy - bogomolnyi ( sb ) model . ''<n> the sb model has been extensively studied in the literature , especially in the context of supersymmetric qcd , where it is known that the higgs sector has a susy partner , called a  higgsino '' , as well as a superpartners for the quarks and leptons , known as  sfermions . '<n> the main purpose of the present paper is to construct a solution for in this note , we study the chiral ring for @xmath0 .<n> we find that the chern - simons - pezzo ( csps ) equations of motion for the first del pezzo do not admit a chiral limit . in the chiral limit<n> , there is an infinite number of degrees of freedom , and we are forced to consider only a finite number of variables . <n> = 10000 chiral symmetry is one of the most important achievements in physics of the last thirty years . despite this ,<n> there are still many open questions about the structure of the phases , especially chiral symmetry breaking , in condensed matter and high energy physics . at the heart of this problem<n> is the nature of the symmetries that are spontaneously broken in a condensed matter system . for instance , it has been known for a long time that the chiral symmetry of the ginzburg - landau theory of elementary particle interactions is spontaneously broken for any spacetime point @xcite . on the other hand , the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can also occur for spacetime points other than the origin of the symmetry , such as at the planck scale . as pointed out by kitaev in this paper , we study the @xmath0 superconformal yang - mills ( scm ) theory , which is a generalization of the well - known supersymmetric qcd .<n> this theory is obtained by adding a gauge invariant quartic term to the superpotential , and is conjectured to be a minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at the unification scale . in the chiral limit , this theory reduces to the well known su(@xmath1 ) gauge theory . <n> we compute the tree - level contributions to the yukawa coupling constants of the s cm theory using the chern - simons ( cs ) formalism and find agreement with the results of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that the rge is a renormalizable theory in the supergravity ( rg ) sense , contrary to the su(n ) case where it is only a supersymmetric rge in the rg sense . we also find that the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale of the theory is much smaller than the planck scale we construct the superpotentials for the @xmath0 superconformal yang - mills theory and for the nonabelian gauge theory in the presence of an anisotropy term .<n> we find that the superconductor - insulator transition in the latter case occurs at a nonzero r - charge . <n> pacs numbers : 11.27.+d , 11.30.pb , 12.20.ds the study of superconductors and superfluids has a long history , going back to the pioneering work of feynman , ginzburg , and zarembo @xcite on superconductivity in condensed matter . in their seminal work<n> , they showed that a superconductor can be described in terms of a gauge theory and a bifundamental representation of the gauge group , the so - called _ quivers _ , which are obtained by gluing together a chain of gauge groups and bifundamentals . since then , there have been a number of attempts to construct gauge theories out of quivers of different kinds , including the construction of @x<n> s gauge theories @x , @x wess - zumino - witten ( ewt ) @ we study the chiral ring in @xmath0 yang - mills theory on the calabi - yau cone .<n> we show that the metric coordinates on the cone are related to the three building blocks of a chiral ring , and we give explicit constructions of these building blocks . <n> it has been known for some time that chiral symmetry can be spontaneously broken in qcd by the introduction of a fermion @xcite . in this letter<n> , we will show that this symmetry can also be broken by introducing a chiral gauge theory in the context of qcd with fermions in the fundamental representation . for this purpose ,<n> we introduce a new class of chiral gauge theories in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with su(@xmath1 ) gauge group , which we call the minimal - supersymmetric - gauge theory ( mmgt ) . as an example of the application of this new type of model , here<n> we consider the simplest case of a gauge theory coupled to qcd , namely , a gauge in which the chiral fields are coupled only to fermionic degrees of freedom , the so - called minimal supergravity ( m in this paper , we study the chiral ring and its metric on the calabi - yau cone .<n> we show that the cone has a non - trivial topology , and we describe the structure of the ring in terms of its metric coordinates . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of relativistic quantum field theory on a space - time manifold has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein and hawking @xcite . in recent years<n> , much progress has been made in understanding the geometry of relativistic space - times , especially in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) . on a geometrical level ,<n> the spacetime manifold is the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 , which is a generalization of the familiar four - dimensional spacetime @x<n> . one of the most important geometrical objects in the relativistic framework is the metric @x , defined as the three dimensional space - space coordinate on the cone , or equivalently , the metric coordinates on the space of relativistic particles . for a general relativistic particle , such a metric<n> can be expressed as the fourier transform of the riemann - hilbert space of the particle in this paper , we introduce a new class of metrics on the space of relativistic kaluza - klein ( kk ) operators .<n> these kk metrics are defined on the cone over @xmath0 , where the metric on the boundary of the space is the kk cone , and are free of singularities at the poles . as an application of these metrics ,<n> we construct a class of holomorphic kk operators and show that they satisfy the dirac equation . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] introduction the study of relativistic kk ( or klein - gordon ) metrics has a long and illustrious history @xcite . in recent years<n> , these metrics have been used to study the behavior of relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetime . among the many applications of kk metric<n> are the constructions of relativistic dirac fermions in qft and of relativistic black holes in general relativity ( gr ) . for a review , see , for example , the paper by datta , das , edmunds , kowalski , mller - ninomiya ( mnk ) @x we compute the r - charges of the de sitter and anti de sitter vacua of the @xmath0 super yang - mills theory using the holographic dual of the gauge theory .<n> we find that the holomorphic functions on these vacua agree with the corresponding functions in supergravity . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of singularities in gauge theories has a long history , going back to the works of bekenstein , hawking and hawking @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been a growing interest in the possibility of using gauge theories to study vacua that arise in nature . for example , it has been suggested that the de - sitter space - time of super - yang mills theory ( sgwm ) , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particle physics , can be used to model vacua in quantum gravity and cosmology , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) of the qcd phase transition . as such ,<n> it is natural to ask whether , and to what extent , a gauge theory can capture the essential physics of a vacua . to answer the question , one needs to we comment on the recent work of j. p. gauntlett and j. sparks @xcite on the duality cascades and chisb - resolution of naked singularities in ads / cft .<n> we also comment on a recent work by d. kachru , r. kallosh , s. linde and m. r. plesser on the superconformal field theory at the calabi - yau singularity . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in the correspondence between gauge theory and geometry . in this letter<n> , we will try to shed some light on the correspondence , in particular , on the issue of whether or not there is a correspondence between the  sasaki - einstein metrics '' of the d - brane gauge theory on the one hand , and the holomorphic functions on the other hand . for a review of the recent works on this subject , see , for example , the recent papers by b. feng , a. k. altmann , d. martelli , j. sparkt , m. bertolini , f. bigazzi and a. l. cotrone @x we present a new class of gauge theories with dual cfts , which we call supersymmetric ads(5 ) .<n> this class contains all superconformal gauge theories dual to the @xmath0 super yang - mills ( skm ) theory as well as all supergravity duals of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . in this paper<n> , we will give a brief review of the supersymmetric cft approach to the ads / cft duality problem , and we will show how this approach can be extended to the case of supergravity . <n> the supergravity duality problem is one of the most difficult to solve in gauge theory , due to the huge number of possible solutions which are needed to construct a cft . for this reason , in the last few years a lot of work has been done on this problem . among these<n> are the works of a. kehagias , m. grana , r. tomasiello , j. p. herzog , d. martelli , f. bigazzi and d. waldram ( see e.g. refs . @ we show that the @xmath0 superconformal gauge theory can be dual to a super yang - mills theory with a gauge symmetry that is broken by the gauge field .<n> the dual gauge theory possesses a gauge invariant anomaly - free sector , where the gauge invariance is preserved by the presence of the gauge symmetry . <n> pacs numbers : 11.30.pb , 12.60.jv , 11.10.kk , 11.27.+d it has been known for a long time that gauge theories that admit a gauge dual , such as su(n ) gauge theories , admit gauge duals as well @xcite . in this paper<n> , we will show that this is the case for the gauge dual of a gauge theory that admits a gauge supersymmetry , which is broken in such a way that the original gauge theory is dual to the gauge theory dual of the theory in question . here<n> we will only discuss the case where the supersymmetry breaking is due to a gauge anomaly , that is , an anomaly in the gauge group , not in the higgs sector . for a general gauge theory ,<n> the gauge supersymmetries are the same as the gauge we construct a matrix model of @xmath0 super yang - mills theory on a @xcite space - time interval , which is a generalization of the well - known warped deformed conifold matrix model .<n> we show that the matrix model possesses a number of remarkable properties : ( i ) it is exactly supersymmetric , ( ii ) its gauge symmetry is maximally symmetric , and ( iii ) the model has no singularities . <n> supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories are among the simplest gauge theories in which the gauge symmetry can be computed exactly . in susy gauge theories ,<n> the gauge group @x of the theory is the same as that of the higgs field , while the gauge groups of the fermions and bosons are not . as a result , the theory has a very simple gauge structure , with only three coupling constants , i.e. , there is no need for any mass term at tree - level , except for the mass of the gauge boson . for this reason , sfermion condensation is a natural candidate for the mechanism responsible for susy symmetry breaking . on the other hand , in sus we review recent progress on the construction of holographic duals of @xmath0 super yang mills theories . <n> seiberg s cascade duality @xcite has become a standard tool for the study of gauge theory cascades .<n> it is based on the idea that , at the end of the cascade , the dual gauge theory can be represented as a supergravity dual of a different gauge theory . in the standard dual gauge theories ,<n> the cascade duality has been shown to be equivalent to the dual supergravity model on a fixed brane , which is itself dual to a gauge theory with varying flux . at the same time<n> , it has been argued that the duals can be constructed from a variety of matrix models , such as the matrix models of aharony , dijkgraaf , vafa , cachazo , douglas , witten , and saad , all of which are known to be dual to gauge theories with varying fluxes . as a consequence of this construction , one obtains a number of interesting dualities , for example , a dual to the standard model on the brane and duals to chiral symmetry breaking .",

ray bands . in the case of infrared surveys , our formula predicts that the confusion coefficients are independent of the survey parameters , i.e. , redshifts and spatial correlation functions , while for submillimeter surveys they are positively correlated . for _<n> spitzer _ irac 3.6 m survey , the formula predicts by making extensive use of the methods of the theory of point process , we present the general analytic formula for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions .<n> we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then show the general formulae for inhomogeneous and clustered source distributions . based on the new formulae ,<n> we reconsider how to treat the confusion noise , focusing on far - infrared and submillimeter galaxies . as an application , in the case of @xmath0-band point source counts<n> , our formulation predicts that the standard way to evaluate the confusion is to integrate the spatial correlation functions over the line of sight , but this method is quite time - consuming and does not provide reliable results . in this case , it is necessary to consider the contribution from the higher - order clustering , which can be evaluated analytically . for this purpose . <n> we find that the confusion can be divided into three stages , depending on the order of the clustering : ( 1 ) the first stage is dominated by the noise due to the fact that the spatial information is not available at the early phase of a survey ; ( 2 ) in the second stage , the effect of the we present a general formulation for the treatment of the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions .<n> we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then present the general formulae for inhomogeneous and clustered source distributions . based on the new formulae ,<n> we reconsider how to treat the confusion noise . as an application<n> , we formulate higher - order clustering of galaxies , which will be included in the general confusion problems . we focus on far - infrared and submillimeter galaxies . <n> * key words : * galaxies : distances and redshifts ; methods : data analysis ; statistics we consider the beam profile of a single source , i.e. , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the value of a random variable @xmath0 .<n> we obtain the exact functional form of the probability density function ( pfdf ) , which turns out to be the same as that of the beam s profile @xcite . here , we use the laplace transform ( lt ) to characterize the pdf of the random variable . as an application ,<n> we present the beam profiles of gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted by compact extragalactic sources . <n> gw sources are the sources of some of the most spectacular observations in modern astrophysics , such as the gw outbursts at the wmap satellite and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . in the standard gw detection , each gw is detected by a pair of interferometers , namely , a ground - based gw array and a high - resolution gw spectrometer . for a given pair of gw detectors , it is possible to determine the position of the detected gw , as well as its angular distribution  we study the effect of clustering on the statistics of point sources .<n> we show that the clustering of a point source can be described by the cumulants of the local fluctuation measure of the source . as a result<n> , the cumulant of the fluctuation measure can be expressed as a function of the number of stars in the field of the point source , i.e. , it can be considered as a kind of measure of clustering . <n> point sources are the sources of astronomical information such as the positions of galaxies , stars , and planets in the sky @xcite . in astrophysics ,<n> the point - source problem has been extensively studied , both theoretically and observationally , using statistical methods such as monte - carlo simulations , maximum likelihood estimators ( mles ) , or fisher - matrix techniques . here<n> we are concerned with the problem of clustering of point - sources , which is more general than the classical one of a single source @xmath0 , where the sources are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere , as long as the source density is known . to study the clustering effect , we consider the point sources as a set of random variables we study the effect of clustering on the statistics of gravitational waves ( gws ) from distant sources .<n> we consider the case of sources that are spatially clustered , i.e. , sources that have a large number of clustered neighbors . for this case<n> , we derive an analytic expression for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the gw signal , which is expressed as a weighted sum of the contributions from the clustered sources , and show that the pdf can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution , provided the clustering is strong enough . as an example , for a sample of @xmath0 gw sources from the crab nebula detected by the cobe / firas interferometers , the pdfs of the peak positions and the peak values of the total flux , as well as the average gw intensity , are calculated , showing that the clustering increases with the clustering strength . <n> gw detection is one of the most important and challenging problems in modern astrophysics . in the field of gravitational wave astronomy ,<n> the detection of gw signals from distant gravitationally bound sources has been a subject of intense research efforts , both theoretically @xcite and we introduce a laplace - stieltjes functional with respect to a random field configuration .<n> it represents the laplace counterpart of the characteristic functional of the random field , both of which are often used in particle physics , turbulence theory , and structure formation theories in the universe , etc.(e.g. * ? ?<n> * ) here we derive the probability density function ( pdf ) of the overall configuration , @xmath0$ ] , which is the assigned probability functional for an overall configuration of the field . as an example<n> , we apply our formalism to the case of a scalar field with an isotropic equation of state . <n> pacs numbers : 05.30.-d , 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r in statistical mechanics , the expectation value of a physical quantity is defined by its expectation value in the configuration space of a system under investigation . for a classical system ,<n> this quantity is given by the correlation function of the system of interest . in quantum mechanics<n> it is usually expressed in terms of the expectation values of observables , such as the mean value and the variance . however , in this letter , we present a new method for the analysis of beam profiles in synchrotron radiation .<n> this method is based on the concept of the fluctuation field as an explicit functional of the beam profile , which can be expressed in terms of the probability generating functional ( pgfl ) of the underlying point field . <n> the idea of using a beam profile to study the statistical properties of a point field was first suggested by beloborodov _<n> et al_. @xcite . in their work ,<n> they considered the effects of a transverse beam profile on the fluctuations of the background flux @xmath0 , and found that the fluctuations in the beam were well described by a probability generating function ( pdf ) , i.e. , a probability distribution that depends only on the beam parameters . since that time<n> , the fluctuation fields have been studied using a variety of statistical techniques , such as monte carlo simulations , kolmogorov - smirnov - wolfenstein ( ksw ) theory , as well as experimental measurements of the time - of - flight ( tof ) cross - section , time - resolved photon counting ( trp we present a new method for the analysis of time - resolved intensity fluctuations in synchrotron radiation .<n> the method is based on the concept of a point field , which can be expanded in terms of a probability generating functional ( pgfl ) , and on the observation of the fluctuation field blurred by a beam profile . as an example<n> , we apply this method to the esi beamline at the stanford linear accelerator center . <n> the study of intensity fluctuations ( i.e. , intensity fluctuations @xcite ) is one of the most important areas of astrophysical research . in recent years , a great effort has been devoted to the development of techniques to measure the intensity fluctuations of high - energy cosmic rays ( crs ) at accelerators such as the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) and the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in the mediterranean , the t2 beamline of the large hadron collider at cern ( lhc ) ( see , for example , * ? ?<n> * , e.g. ? * ; * !<n> ! ? ... ) as well as we present a new method for the clustering of sources in a beam .<n> the method is based on the concept of a point field , which is defined by a set of @xmath0 point sources in the beam , and a poisson process in the transverse plane . by clustering the sources , the number of sources can be increased by increasing the beam size . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of a beam with circular symmetry . <n> _ introduction. _ clustering is an important concept in statistical physics , as it allows one to define a measure of the amount of information that can be extracted from a sample . in statistical mechanics ,<n> a sample is considered to be a collection of independent random variables , each of which is a probability density function ( pdf ) of the variables of interest , such as the variance , skewness , kurtosis , etc . @xcite . for a given distribution of random variables<n> the pdf can be decomposed into a sum - of - squares ( ss ) part and a variance part , called the _ total _ or _ variance _ part . the total or variance part we present a new method to derive the pdf of the projected stellar density distribution of the milky way .<n> the method is based on the fact that the intensity of the stellar density fluctuations depends on the position on the sky , and the joint probability for some positions is poisson distributed . in the case of spatially inhomogeneous intensity distribution ,<n> the pdf is expressed in terms of the intensity within a beam . as an example , we apply the method to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) . <n> we present an efficient method to calculate the pdf for the projected density distribution ( pdsd ) of the galaxy , which can be used to estimate the position of the pd s at different epochs , such as months , years , or years after the discovery of the object @xcite . to obtain the pdf<n> , the monte carlo method is applied to a set of point - spread functions ( psfs ) obtained by the _ einstein _ observatory , _<n> fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , ground - based observations , as well as the fluctuation analysis of the x - ray background ( xrb ) can be divided into two parts : the point fluctuation analysis and the confusion analysis . in the former<n> , we derive the correlation function of the point source , which is expressed as the product of the correlation functions of the sources distributed at random on the sky .<n> we also derive the characteristic functional of the fluctuation field , and use it to derive the formula of the confusion function . <n> the xrb is one of the main cosmological probes of the large - scale structure of the universe , containing the information of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and supernovae ( sne ) . to reveal the nature of the cmb and sn components ,<n> they have to be measured with high accuracy , e.g. , by the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites @xcite , or by ground - based optical interferometers , such as _<n> hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst ) or _ space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics_. the main goal of the analysis is to extract the cosmological constant ( @xmath we study the effect of source clustering on the statistical properties of a fluctuation field .<n> we show that the point source distribution function ( pdf ) depends only on the correlation function of the field , and not on the clustering properties of the sources . as a consequence ,<n> the pdf of the point field is gaussian , independent of the clustering property of the source field and of the fluctuation amplitude . in the fluctuation analysis of sky brightness @xcite , the characteristic functional @xmath0 is used to study the properties of fluctuation fields . here<n> we apply the same formalism to the case of a field of point sources , whose correlation function depends on the source clustering properties . <n> [ sec : intro ] it has been known for a long time that the fluctuations of the sky are affected by the clustering of their sources : the number of clustered sources is larger than that of the unclustered sources and the variance of the fluctuations is larger , so that the average of the correlation functions of the two fields is not equal to unity , even if they are distributed at random on the sky . for a point field<n> , this means that there is a correlation function for the field @x we calculate the intensity fluctuation spectrum ( pdf ) for a cluster of @xmath0 rydberg atoms in an optical lattice .<n> the pdf is obtained by solving the laplace equation , and is found to be similar to the one for a single , isolated , cluster of atoms . <n> the study of fluctuation spectra is important for several fields of physics , such as condensed matter , atom optics , high - energy physics and cosmology . in condensed matter physics<n> the intensity fluctuations ( pdfs ) @xcite are of central importance , as they govern the dynamics of a large variety of systems , including the transport of heat , electrons , ions , atoms , molecules , superfluids , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and superconductors . for a system in equilibrium<n> , the pdf of intensity fluctuations is given by the well - known lieb - liniger relation ( lr ) , which states that the fluctuations of the average number of electrons in the sample are equal to the number of atoms that occupy the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the system . as a consequence ,<n> the  in this paper , we present a new method to evaluate the effect of the confusion noise on the source number counts .<n> the method is based on the cumulants of the probability density function of the intensity fluctuation , which are obtained by the method of laplace inversion . as a result<n> , it is possible to calculate the correction to the number counts in the case that the dispersion of the error does not depend on the flux . <n> it has been well - known that the observed number counts of astronomical sources are affected by statistical noise , such as gaussian noise and confusion noise @xcite . in particular , the source counts are strongly affected by the eddington bias , i.e. , by the fact that the noise causes the observed counts to be biased upward . for a source with a flux larger than a certain threshold ,<n> the number count is very sensitive to the uncertainty of the source , and the correction can be very large . on the other hand , for a flux smaller than that of the correction , there is a small window in which the correction is negligibly small , so that the correction does not affect the source count significantly . when the source flux is we present a new method to evaluate the effect of the confusion noise in cluster surveys .<n> the method is based on the fact that the fluctuation field @xmath0 is directly related to the noise intensity distribution @xcite , which can be evaluated by a monte carlo approach . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 3 ( dr3 ) , and find that the confusion effect is significant for faint sources . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : diffuse radiation <n> methods : data analysis <n> surveys galaxies : clustering large -

like source , then the probability of observing it as a source is proportional to the square of the source flux . in the case of diffuse background radiation ,<n> the probability is a power - law function of the number of detected sources , @ xmath2 , where the exponent is @x we propose a method to determine the beam size from the fluctuation power spectrum ( pdf ) .<n> the method is applied to subaru suprime - cam ( ssc ) data , which is the largest data set currently available . in order to obtain the best signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio ,<n> we need to minimize the noise in the beam . to this end<n> , we first derive the noise power spectrum , and then derive the confusion limit , i.e. , the upper limit of the noise intensity , based on the fluctuation pdf . <n> the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cgro _ ) is a wide - field imaging survey instrument with a beam size of @xmath0 , covering a wide range of angular scales @xcite . at the same time , it is equipped with a ccd mosaic ccd camera , so that it can resolve point sources down to a few arcminutes . by combining the information from the two instruments , one can determine the position of the point sources with precision better than a few degrees . for a given angular scale , _<n> chandra _ and _ we derive the limit signal strength as an upper cutoff of the integration in the second - order cumulant formulae for source confusion limits .<n> we also use the exponent of cumulative number counts @xmath0 for clustered sources , and derive the expression for the limit flux . for unclustered sources<n> , we obtain the confusion limit flux to a cutoff signal of the same power - law exponent of differential number counts as @xcite . <n> it has been known for a long time that confusion limits are important for the statistical analysis of gravitational wave ( gw ) data . in the past , confusion limits<n> have been derived either by assuming that the number counts are described by power - laws , or by assuming the source confusion limit is proportional to the square root of the beam size . here<n> we show that the exact formulas for the confusion limits can be derived from two complementary approaches : ( 1 ) by using the exact expressions for the source and gw confusion limits as upper cutoffs of the integrals over the range of signal strength ; and ( 2 ) from using the expression of the confusion - limit flux as a function of the source number count , which is expressed in terms of the exponent @x we study the problem of confusion in multi - frequency surveys of point sources .<n> we show that the standard formulae for the confusion limit of unclustered sources can be derived in two ways : one using the exponent of differential number counts @xmath0 , and the other using the empirical rule of thumb @xcite . in the latter case<n> , we also derive an expression for the cutoff signal , which is independent of the number of frequency bands , as well as a formula for the maximum number of sources that can be processed in a single run of the survey . <n> [ [ section ] ] the basic goal of this paper is to study the question of confusion limits for point - source detection in multifrequency surveys . to answer this question ,<n> we consider two basic types of number - count distributions : number counts that are described by a power - law , or differential number count distributions that are given by a log - normal distribution . for both types of distributions , <n> we derive formulas for the limit flux to a cutoff signal as a function of the confusion parameters , namely , the spectral index of the source and the confusion parameter of the beam pattern , for both the uncluster we present an iterative formula for the confusion limit of the number counts of a gaussian beam and clustered sources .<n> we also present an empirical rule of thumb for the limit and compare it with the formula obtained from the iterative formula . <n> it is well known that the number of photons in a beam is proportional to the square root of the beam size @xcite . in this paper<n> , we present a method to calculate the confusion limits for the number count of a beam of arbitrary size , which is a generalization of the method presented by t. chen _<n> et al _ , j. phys . a : math . theor . * 39 * , 3591 ( 1999 ) . here<n> we focus on the beam pattern and the total number of the photons in the beam , and present an analytic formula for their confusion limits . as an example , for a beam with @xmath0 photons , our formula reproduces the result of t - chen<n> _ et al_. by using this formula , it is possible to estimate the confusions of the general number counts , including the clustered ones , with a good accuracy  in this paper , we study the beam - beam number counts in the confusion limit .<n> we present an iterative formula for the general number counts , and obtain a general relation between the beam size and the confuser limit for a gaussian beam . <n> pacs number(s ) : 41.60.-m , 41.75.ht , 42.65.sf , 07.05.kf the number counting problem is one of the most important in the field of high - energy physics , as it is directly related to the nature of the particles produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such as the quarks , gluons , protons , neutrons , etc . as a consequence ,<n> the number counts plays an important role in the determination of the cross - sections of the reactions , which are of great importance for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as well as the hadron collider ( hc ) experiments @xcite . in the last decade , a great deal of work has been done in this field , both theoretically and experimentally , with the aim of developing a complete picture of the number - counting in the infrared band , the angular correlation function of galaxies is known to be well approximated by a power - law .<n> however , this is not the case in the submillimeter , where the source confusion limit is much smaller than the beam size . in this paper<n> , we show that the confusion limit of infrared galaxies can be expressed as a product of angular correlation functions of different orders , and we apply this result to the galaxy clustering as a typical example of the galaxy surveys in the near infrared and submillimeter wavebands . <n> galaxy clustering is a fundamental property of galaxies , which plays an important role in understanding the large - scale structure of the universe , as well as the cosmological evolution of galaxies @xcite . at present , there is a large number of surveys for galaxies in the mid- and far - infrared bands ( @xmath0 ) , especially for the upcoming infrared space facilities such as _<n> spitzer _ , _ herschel _ and _ agile_.<n> these surveys cover a wide range of wavelengths , from the x - ray to the mid - infrared , with the goal of understanding the distribution of galaxies in these bands . we study the source confusion limits for galaxies in the _ iras _ @xmath0 m survey , and compare them with the predictions of the hierarchical clustering model .<n> we find that the confusion limits of infrared galaxies are much smaller than those of submillimeter galaxies , which is in agreement with the results of @xcite . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxy : statistics galaxies : distances and redshifts <n> cosmology : theory large - scale structure of universe in the infrared ( ir ) band , where galaxies are supposed to be present , is one of the most interesting and challenging problems in astronomy . in the last decade<n> , _<n> spitzer space telescope _ ( sst ) has discovered hundreds of thousands of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in the nearby universe @x<n> . however , the number of these sources is still too small to fully understand the ir galaxy distribution . to this end , it is necessary to consider the confusion of lirg sources , i.e. , how many sources are present at a certain flux level and at a given angular position in the sky ?<n> this problem has been studied we study the two - point angular correlation function of the _ iras _ @xmath0@xmath1 m galaxy survey , and show that it is well approximated by a power - law , i.e. , a log - normal distribution .<n> we find that the characteristic depth of the survey is important for the dilution of clustering , which is more effective for higher - order clustering . as a result<n> , we obtain the scaling relations of the correlation function with the survey depth and find that they are consistent with those obtained for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxy redshift survey ( gsrs ) . <n> the correlation structure of the galaxy distribution is one of the most fundamental properties of the universe . in the local universe , galaxies are preferentially found in low - density environments , such as clusters and voids @xcite . on the other hand , in high - redshift universes ,<n> galaxies are found preferentially in massive clusters , like galaxies in the virgo cluster , the large - scale structure in the hubble flow , or the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the nearby universe we present a statistical analysis of confusion - related quantities of the _ iras _ faint galaxy survey ( fgls ) at @xmath0 , based on the statistical properties of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution .<n> first , we show that the statistic of the confusion limit , which is defined as the difference between the number of detected galaxies and that of unresolvable sources , is well approximated by a power - law number count model with the index of the model , 2.5 , and depends on the detected flux only through the flux - dependent clustering , i.e. , the  fiducial ' flux . in order to evaluate the average clustering strength of the fgl galaxy sample ,<n> we calculate the correlation function of the galaxy distribution based on monte - carlo simulations . as a result<n> , it is found that the correlation structure strongly affects the statistics of the counts of confused galaxies , such as the lcc index , l@xmath1 , etc . <n> second , by applying the same model to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) galaxy sample with the same we study the statistical properties of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution in the _ iras _ infrared galaxy catalog , and show that the effect of clustering can be very severe if the number counts are described by _ a single power - law_. in this case , we find that the relative contribution of clustering to the total fluctuation compared with poisson component becomes larger for large @xmath0 , which is consistent with the results reported by @xcite for dusty galaxies at ir wavelengths . <n> galaxies are a powerful tool to study the large - scale structure of the universe .<n> they can be divided into two classes , the  early - type ' galaxies (  e - galaxies ' ) , whose properties are similar to those of galaxies in the local universe , as well as  late - types ' galaxies , with properties similar to the local ones . in the latter class ,<n> the properties of galaxies are much more complicated , such as their mass distribution , clustering strength , luminosity function , etc. , than those of the early - types , because the clustering of galaxies is much stronger than that of the late - type galaxies . as a result  deep surveys by _ iso _ revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy number counts .<n> the observed number counts of infrared galaxies show a rapid increase in number count level , with cumulative slope @xmath0 much steeper than that of unclustered sources @xcite . in order to understand the origin of the extremely steep number - count slope , it is necessary to consider the effect of clustering , which can be very severe if the number counts are described by a power - law function . here<n> we present a model of the spatial two - point correlation function of galaxies , and show that the clustering makes the confusion limit much shallower than the unclustering case , even though the rms of the confusion noise is large . based on this model , we obtained the confusion limits of 1.8 mjy and 2.0 mjy for the 90@xmath1 m and 170@x.1 m _<n> iso_-detected sources , respectively . <n> [ [ section ] ] the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_@xcite ( hereafter referred to as _ _ i _ for short ) is a new , powerful , ground - based we extend the method of toffolatti et al . to calculate the two - point correlation function ( pdf ) of infrared galaxy number counts .<n> the method is based on the empirical model of @xcite , which is extended to include the effect of clustering . as a result<n> , we find that the pdf of the infrared galaxy counts can not be described by a power - law function , but has a heavy tail , and the peak probability decreases up to @xmath0 % and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier . in the infrared wavelength range ,<n> the number counts of infrared galaxies observed by _ iso _ are extremely difficult to explain by any simple theoretical model , because the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) is too faint to be detected , so that the observed number counts are strongly affected by the effects of galaxy clustering ( also known as confusion ) . here<n> we present the pdfs of infrared number counts that are expected to be measured by future airborne or space submillimetric facilities such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture sub - millimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory _ ( _ astro - f _ ) in the submillimeter source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington .<n> fundamental assumption of the formulation is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky . however , this assumption is not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe . in this work , by making extensive use of the statistical formulation for spatial correlation functions , we show a useful result for the contribution of clustering to the confusion effect . <n> submillimeter galaxies are dusty starbursts , and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation . hence , the statistical structure of the submm background carries crucial information of the spatial distribution of high - redshift starburst galaxies . our analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated cosmological models , hence the confusion problem should be properly considered for future airborne or space submillimeter observational projects such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture submillimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory_. the measured confusion limit from scuba survey data was found to be shallower than that expected from classical formula ( d. h. hughes 2003  we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions , based on the methods related to the point field theory . with these formulae , we calculated the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure . as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies , the confusion limits were calculated from the power - law number counts , assuming an infrared facility with an aperture of 70 cm and an airy psf .<n> we found a broadening of the probability density function ( pdf ) by clustering , i.e. , increase of the variance , corresponding to the increased confusion limit flux density . at @xmath0 = 2.0 ,<n> the clustering effect becomes very severe , and the peak probability of the pdf decreases up to a few % , depending on the adopted assumption for the spectral energy distribution of galaxies . for the pdf at these wavelength bands , a steep slope is observed , which is observed for _ iras _ galaxies and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation . we estimated the pdf and confusion limits based on a realistic number count model of @xcite , under the same hypothetical infrared facility  we present a new method for the analysis of the submillimeter galaxy number counts and fluctuations .<n> we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we calculated the confusion limits from the power - law number counts , and from the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity . at infrared wavelengths ,<n> the clustering effect becomes very severe , so that we estimated the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model of hughes , enoki , taihei yano , seiji ueda , takuji tsujimoto , naoteru gouda , yasmin friedmann , hiroshi shibai , & hiroyuki hirashita . <n> we also applied our method to future submillimeter large surveys , such as _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf_.<n> our analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated complex cosmological models . we derive the first- and second - order cumulants of the submillimeter photometric fluctuations , @xmath0$ ] , from the probability generating functions ( pgfs ) of the clustered photometric sources .<n> first , we show how to derive the lt [ equation : laplace_for_cluster ] for the fluctuation field of clustered sources , which is useful in the field of counts - in - cells analysis . here<n> we start with the equation for the laplace transform ( lt ) @xcite of the probability density function ( pdf ) for a poisson distribution . in this lt<n> , it is important to take the clustering effect into account , because the tail of the pdf becomes heavier , and the factorial moments of the fluctuation fields become smaller . as a result ,<n> the cumulants are smaller , but they are still of the same order of magnitude as the gaussian cumulants . <n> we also present a method for the derivation of the first and second cumulants in the fluctuation analysis of the data by _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf_.<n> we will also apply our method to future we present the derivation of the first- and second - order cumulants for the fluctuation field of clustered sources .<n> these summary statistics are widely used in the field of structure formation , especially for counts - in - cells analysis . here<n> we present how to derive these quantities from the laplace equation . as an example<n> , we apply our method to the analysis of the time - series of the number of clustered photons in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . <n> recently , the concept of summary statistics has been applied to the statistical analysis of photon counting in complex networks ( cnns ) @xcite . in summary statistics ,<n> a cluster is defined as a set of @xmath0 probability measures , such as probability density , variance , skewness , kurtosis , etc , on the probability distribution of the photon flux . for a given probability distribution , a cluster<n> is said to be  clustered ' if the variance of its probability distribution is larger than that of the distribution of other probability distributions ( e.g. , power - law distribution ) of the same type , and it is called  summary statistics ' in this paper , we present a new approach to the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) .<n> our method is based on the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for an interacting many - body system . in this approach ,<n> the hamiltonian is written as a sum of two terms : a term proportional to @xmath0 , which describes the time evolution of the system s ground state , and a term that describes the transition from the ground state to the first excited state . using this approach<n> we derive an analytic expression for the phase diagram of a strongly interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of an external magnetic field . <n> recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the problem of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a superfluid to a mott insulator ( mi ) phase of bosonic atoms @xcite . the transition is of first order in the bec - mi phase diagram , where the system undergoes a first - order phase transition into the superfluid phase . at the transition point<n> , the density of states ( dos in this paper , we derive the entanglement spectrum of a quantum dot coupled to a bosonic bath .<n> we show that the entanglement of the quantum dot and the bath can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the bath s interaction with the dot . as an application ,<n> we calculate the entanglement between two quantum dots coupled to two bosonic baths . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum systems @xcite . in quantum mechanics<n> , entanglement can be quantified by the negativity @xmath0 , which measures the degree of nonlocality of the system , and by the reduced density matrix , or equivalently , by the entanglement entropy , defined as the difference between the number of maximally entangled states and the total number of entangled states . for a system of a classical particle interacting with a classical field , the entanglement<n> can be defined by the wigner - smith - dyson ( wsd ) entanglement spectrum , in which the amplitudes of the eigenstates of the classical system are given by the product of the reduced densities of states ( dos ) of the two classical systems , with the additional term that the system is not entangled . the ws we present a quantum master equation that describes the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a bath of bosons .<n> the master equation is solved exactly in the limit of a weak coupling between the quantum dot and the bath , and the steady - state solution is obtained . in this limit<n> , the steady state solution can be expressed as a sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the bath bath s bath frequency and the other is a function of the dot - bath coupling strength . for weak coupling ,<n> we find that the system is always in a metastable state , which is characterized by a steady decrease in the dot s density of states with the increase of the bath - dot coupling . <n> quantum dot ( qd ) systems have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically due to their potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite and quantum simulation of quantum many - body systems with high precision @x<n> . however , it is well - known that in the presence of dissipation and disorder , qd systems can not be in a stable state . as a result , in order to reach a steady state the system must be prepared in a non - equilibrium state ; in other we present a numerical result for the number of sources per beam , @xmath0 , at the confusion limit for the case of airy beam .<n> we obtain an analytic formula for the confusion of power - law source counts , which is in good agreement with the numerical result . <n> [ firstpage ] methods : numerical binaries : close stars : fundamental parameters infrared : general . in this letter , we study the number of sources per beam , @xmath0 , and the angular correlation function of galaxies at the confusion limit for the case of airy beam .<n> we find that the confusion rate increases with the slope index of the power - law angular correlation functions , i.e. , the slope of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xcite . as a result ,<n> we show that for a beam of beam area of 100 kpc@xmath1 and a galaxy sample of 100 galaxies , a confusion rate of @xxmath2 can be achieved . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : clustering cosmology : observations large - scale structure of universe in this paper , we derive the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the number of sources per beam and the correlation length of the beam pattern in the presence of a random source field .<n> we show that the correlation lengths are proportional to the power - law exponents of the source number counts and the angular correlation function of galaxies , respectively . in the case of a gaussian beam pattern<n> , the pdf can be expressed as @xmath0 , where the exponents are determined by the airy function . <n> optical instruments such as optical tweezers , spectrographs , and polarizers are used widely in the astronomical community for various applications , such as precision spectroscopy , imaging , optical coherence tomography , etc . for each application , it is important to understand the underlying physics of the instrument , i.e. , how the instrument works , what the beam is doing and how it is coupled to the environment . to this end , in recent years , a great deal of work has been done on the theoretical foundations of optical instruments and their use in various fields of science , for example , gravitational lensing , astrometry , cosmology , quantum optics  we present a new method for the statistical analysis of point sources in a beam .<n> the method is based on the concept of a probability generating functional ( pgfl ) , which is a functional of the number of sources in the beam , their differential number count , and the correlation function of the point sources . in the limit of a large beam size<n> , the pgfl can be approximated by the laplace transform of a random field , while in the case of a small beam size , it can be expressed in terms of the gaussian beam profile . as an example of the application of the method , we present results for the point - source number counts and correlation functions of a beam containing @xmath0 point sources and compare them with those of a classical point - field of the same beam size and flux density . <n> the number counts of a point field are a useful tool for the study of the statistics of astronomical sources , such as stars , supernovae , pulsars , etc . @xcite . however , they are not applicable to the statistical study of point - sources in beams , since the beam size is not a constant , but depends on the we present a new algorithm for the detection of point sources in a beam .<n> the algorithm is based on the use of the laplace - stieltjes approximation to the distribution of the number of sources in the beam , which is extended to the measurement of the mean flux density of a point source . <n> we apply the algorithm to a data set of @xmath0 pb@xmath1 of muon and x - ray data taken with the lsst detector at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) . in this data set , we detected point sources down to a flux density level of about @xcite , corresponding to a source count of about one per cent of the total number of muons in the detector , and to a mean source number density of about two per cent . we have also measured the mean fluxes of the point sources and of their mean number density , as well as the average fluxes of their number density and mean number flux density . from these data we have obtained the following results : + 1 . the average number of point -

lined spectroscopic binaries , in which the primaries and secondaries are main - sequence stars in a binary system with a common proper motion ( _ cpm _ ) @xcite . in cpm systems ,<n> the components have the same luminosity , chemical composition , age , distance and metallicity , as well as the same proper motion , radial velocity and rotational velocity . \"<n> the idea that a star in a cpm system could be orbiting its more massive companion is at the basis of the modern generation of spectroscopic surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the william hers we have searched the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) catalog for cpm multiples consisting of at least one _ hipparcos _ star with one or more non -

north catalog ,<n> we searched the cpm triples for pairs consisting of one non - hipparco star with an additional component at larger separations . we found 347 cpm doubles and 5 triples with separations ranging from @xmath0 au to more than 50 au . <n> the discovery of multiple stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) has greatly increased the number of known globular clusters in the milky way . in the _ kepler _<n> globular cluster system , there are more than 2000 stars that are members of multiple systems . of these , more than 200 are known to be in double or triple systems ; however , the fraction of known double we have searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm multiples consisting of one or more _ hipparcos _ stars with separations @xmath0 .<n> we have identified a total of 347 cpm double systems , 10 triples , and 1 quadruple system . of the 158 systems reported here , only 80 had been previously reported in gc04 . we have verified that in every case the two stars do indeed have very similar proper motions , so it is very unlikely that any of those pairs could be chance alignments . because we lack parallax measurements for the non-_hipparcos<n> _ secondaries , it is not possible to verify the binary status of these pairs by direct comparison of their measured distances , but we can plot the color and magnitude of the secondary in a color - magnitude diagram to see if the star is at the same distance from the sun as its primary . we report the discovery of a previously unknown binary system at a projected separation of @xmath0 pc from the sun , at a spectral type of b@xmath1v .<n> the system was initially identified in the _ hipparcos _ catalog as a pair of bright cpm dwarfs at a common proper motion distance @xcite , but our follow - up photometry reveals that the system is actually composed of two red dwarfs , which we have confirmed spectroscopically from _ hst _<n> wfpc2 photometry . <n> we have measured a trigonometric parallax for the pair of stars , and find that the projected separation between the two stars is @x.1 pc , making this the most distant binary system known to date with a spectroscopically confirmed spectroscopic binary companion . at the distance of the system ,<n> the primary star has a mass of 0.45 m@xcite and a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-0.24 dex , while the secondary is only a few tenths of a magnitude fainter , with a mass and metallicity similar to that of a zams star at the same spectral type and luminosity . we present optical photometry of secondaries to white dwarf and main sequence stars with known trigonometric parallaxes .<n> we find that the secondaries tend to lie close to either the main sequence or the white dwarf cooling sequence , with a mean offset of 0.11 mag between the two sequences . <n> white dwarfs are the largest class of stars in the milky way , making up @xmath0 of all stars brighter than m@xmath1 , and they are the dominant component of the stellar population in the solar neighborhood @xcite . in the nearby universe , however , the largest fraction of stars are giant or supergiant stars , which makes them ideal tracers of the history of the star formation process and the initial mass function ( imf ) . the largest single source of uncertainty in the imf is the mass of the parent star ; in the case of m dwarfs , for example , there is currently no direct method of determining the mass from observed luminosities , surface temperatures , or surface gravities . there are , of course , other sources of uncertainty , such as metallicity , chemical composition , rotation , age , we use _ hipparcos _ and @xmath0 photometry to search for subdwarfs in close binary systems near the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence .<n> we identify 20 secondaries that lie 0.42 mag above the standard main sequence , and an additional 11 pairs that lie between the main sequences and the white dwarf sequence ; nine of these secondaries are found to be foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with background stars , while the remaining 11 secondaries may be foreground white dwarfs , chance pairs of stars with the same color and absolute magnitude , or unresolved double stars . among the secondaries , we find one pair with a transverse velocity of only 0.11 mag , suggesting that this star is a metal -

infrared photometry from the 2mass @xmath0 survey . <n> we find a total of 38 candidate wide pairs of cpm stars , with angular separations ranging from 0.055 - 0.08 arcseconds . of these pairs ,<n> 16 have projected transverse velocities consistent with the primary and secondary being on the main sequence , three are subdwarfs , two are foreground white dwarfs , one is a high - velocity white dwarf in a chance alignment with a foreground star , six are background red dwarfs in chance alignments with background _ hipparcos _ stars and two are  uncertain '' pairs that should be real physical binaries . in the color -

1@xcite and to have metallicities between -0.2 and -0.1 dex . on the other hand , for more massive stars , metallicities are expected to decrease with increasing distance we report the results of a search for wide ( separations @xmath0 au ) spectroscopic binary systems from the fourth data release of the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> our search yielded 347 new wide binary systems , including 10 triples and one quadruple , as well as 26 new wide pairs from luyten s lds catalog , for a total of 362 new wide binaries . <n> the large angular separations of the wide binaries makes them ideal probes of circumstellar disks , since they can be readily distinguished from single - lined spectroscopic binaries by their luminosities , colors , and proper motions . as a byproduct of our survey , we also report the discovery of a new type of binary , the  double - degenerate '' system , in which both stars in the primary are main - sequence stars and the secondary is a subgiant or a wolf - rayet star . in general , wide binaries are good probes of the circumstellar environment of their host stars , because they are relatively immune to mass - transfer and because the mass ratio of the two components can be determined reliably . from a statistical perspective , our census is complete up to @x we report the results of a search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars using the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) .<n> we have identified 509 new wide binary systems , bringing the total number of known pairs to 783 . of these 783 pairs ,<n> 263 are newly reported here for the first time , as well as 148 that were listed in luyten s lds catalog but were not listed in the gc04 catalog . <n> the large area covered by our search ( @xmath0 ) and the high completeness of our catalog ( 98% ) allow us to identify virtually all known _ gc _ secondaries , down to an apparent magnitude of 18 , and to recover essentially all of the pairs listed in geronimo - clegg et al.s ( 2004 ) catalog , which has a much lower completeness . in total , we find that our survey recovers essentially all the pairs of gc 04 and adds a significant number of new objects . among the 783 new pairs reported here , 263 have at least one primary and/or secondary that are both listed in either the rnltt or we report the results of a search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars using the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) in the northern sky .<n> we have recovered all known pairs from the catalogue of gc04 , and added a significant number of new pairs , many of which were not included in that catalog . in total , we have identified more than 100 new secondaries , most of which are likely to be subdwarfs . <n> our search for secondaries has been motivated by the need to understand the distribution of companion stars around _ fgk _ main - sequence stars , which have been shown to have a wide range of angular separations , from @xmath0 mas to a few milliarcseconds . at large separations<n> , secondaries can be difficult to detect because they are often too bright to be seen in the glare of their primary stars . as a result ,<n> the number of known secondaries of _ g -

north catalog , and is complete down to the limiting absolute magnitude of the catalog . for secondaries fainter than the magnitude limit , we use the _ hipparcos _ and 2mass catalogs to estimate the incompleteness of our census . we find that the secondaries are dominated by m dwarfs , with a median transverse velocity of 300 km s@xcite . <n> binaries : close stars : kinematics and dynamics open clusters and associations : general open clusters : individual : ngc 6946 open clusters we report the results of a search for secondaries in the _ hipparcos _ catalog of main sequence stars .<n> we find a total of @xmath0 secondaries with projected angular separations between 0@xmath1 and 1@math1 , down to a limiting absolute magnitude of 25.5 , and covering a range of distances between 15 pc and 100 pc . of these ,<n> @xcite have reported the discovery of more than 100 secondaries , but only a few of them are very close to the limiting magnitude of the lspm - north catalog . <n> the luminosity function of secondaries is similar to that of the field stars , indicating that the formation mechanisms for the secondaries are similar to those for the field population . however , we find that the distribution in absolute magnitude is significantly different from that predicted by the model , suggesting that formation mechanisms are biased against secondaries of low - mass , i.e. , hydrogen - burning , stars at large distances . in recent years<n> , the number of proper motion secondaries has increased dramatically , with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @ we report the results of a search for hydrogen - burning secondaries in the solar neighborhood , using data from the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> we have determined that our northern - sky census was statistically complete for systems within 100 pc and proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , and for cpm companions with luminosities in the @xcite range . from our statistically complete sample of cpm pairs with _ primaries , we can now estimate the multiplicity fraction of wide binary systems in the sun . <n> the luminosity function of secondaries is a fundamental parameter in the study of the structure and evolution of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . in recent years<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the faint end of this luminosity function , in particular in secondaries of very low mass . to understand the formation mechanisms for secondaries , it is necessary to know the number of very - low mass secondaries that are likely to be found in the field , since the absolute magnitude of main - sequence stars is correlated with mass ; the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time . the we present an estimate of the multiplicity fraction of wide binaries in the solar neighborhood based on the _ hipparcos _ catalog of stars north of the celestial equator with proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .<n> we find that at least 50% of all stellar systems within 100 pc of the sun comprise wide binaries / multiples with projected separations between the components less than 0.1 au . <n> wide binaries are binary systems in which the primary star is a main - sequence star and a low - mass secondaries ( either a planetary nebula or a compact object ) orbit the star at a separation of less than a parsec . in most cases ,<n> the mass ratio between the primary and secondaries is close to the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) , so that gravitational perturbations from the primary s gravitational potential and the secondary s would disrupt the wide system over a time - scale of a few billion years . for a wide binary to survive this period , the secondary star must have a mass greater than about 0.1 solar masses , and<n> the system must remain stable against tidal disruption for a time much longer than the age of the solar system . as a result  we conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .<n> we find no evidence for cpm companions in this sample , and place an upper limit on the fraction of binaries containing a typical , nearby star as a companion . for binaries with projected separations<n> less than 10 au , we find that the frequency distribution can be described by a power law of the form @xcite . at larger separations ,<n> the distribution is consistent with _ pik s law_.<n> however , at separations greater than 10au , the observed distribution is not consistent with the model used in @cite , which predicts a distribution with a power - law index of 2 . we conclude that star formation processes initially yield a distribution of wide binaries / multiples which breaks down because of the disruptive effects of the environment in which these systems are born . <n> [ [ section ] ] one of the most important open questions in astrophysics is how the distribution of orbital separations of stellar systems is affected by the formation and evolution of stars in the vicinity of the sun . in particular , we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of our catalog , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations .<n> we find that the distribution of orbital separations is consistent with _ pik s law _ over a wide range of separations ( up to about 10 au ) . beyond that range ,<n> the frequency of wide binaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population . the secondaries , on the other hand , are dominated by fainter k - m dwarfs , with a range of absolute magnitude peaking at @xcite . while fainter , lower - mass secondaries clearly dominate over companions of similar masses and luminosities , one finds only half the number of faint secondaries as one would expect if both primaries and secondaries were drawn from we present a large , statistically complete census of common proper motion ( cpm ) companions to _ hipparcos _ stars based on the large synoptic survey of the northern sky ( lspm - north ) .<n> this survey covers 20,000 square degrees and is complete to proper motion @xmath0 , with a completeness limit of @xcite . using this large sample of wide cpm pairs<n> , we find clear evidence for a break in _ pik s law _ at large angular separations , and that the frequency of wide binaries decreases with increasing orbital separation . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' common proper motion ( cpm ) binaries are pairs of stars whose orbital separations are within a fraction of an arcsecond of each other .<n> a complete census of cpm pairs should be possible with adaptive optics systems on large telescopes , such as the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) or the keck 10-m telescope , and with ccd imaging systems , like the _ hipparcos _ satellite . <n> the lspm - south catalog ( lpine & shara , in preparation ) , which will be the analog of the lds - north catalog for the southern declinations , will double the census of the southern proper motion pairs . in the future<n> , a catalog of wide binaries should also be expanded further by extending the search to smaller proper motion regimes . we present preliminary results from a survey of subdwarf pairs at @xmath0 .<n> the pairs are selected from the rosat all - sky survey using the standard candle method , and are selected to have either one or two detected components . in most cases the detected components are blueshifted low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . however , in a few cases there are clear detections of additional components , some of which are due to extragalactic sources . <n> the main aim of this survey is to search for additional lmxb components in order to see if there are any extra galaxies out there that are similar to the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) in the galactic halo , or if there is a correlation between the onc and the extended halo of the galaxy , as found in the liner ngc 6397 . at present , there are no known extra galaxies that can be associated with onc or with any extended halo in the milky way ( mw ) andromeda ( lmc ) as well as with any compact galaxy . for a complete list of lines of sight<n> see e.g. refs.@x we present the results of a survey of extragalactic subdwarfs using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .<n> the survey covers a large number of objects from the galactic plane out to a distance of @xmath0 . in most cases , more than one object is detected , but most of the detections are of undetected objects . for each object , the angular separation of the detected object is measured , as well as the angular size and luminosity of the source . <n> we present a list of detected objects and their angular separations , using the latest data from the vlbi sky survey ( nvss ) and the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) for objects with known redshifts . from these measurements , we find that about one third of the objects are undetected , while about half are detected for the first time , and about half of them are found to be extended , in contrast to the expected frequency of detection of extended objects in the sky surveys . the extended objects are often found to lie close to the galactic midplane , so they are likely to be gravitationally bound  we present optical images of the galactic bulge made with the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) .<n> most of the galaxies are close to edge - on , so are affected by the extragalactic gravitational lensing . however , there are also a number of foreground galaxies , including active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries , which are not significantly affected . <n> the discovery of the centroids of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in the early universe @xcite has triggered a lot of activity , both observationally and theoretically . in the standard model of the universe ( sm )<n> , the lmc is the only dark matter ( dm ) component , while the cmb is the baryonic component which is responsible for the dark energy ( de ) radiated into the universe . for a long time , it was believed that the cme was dominated by dust and dark matter , but recent observations have shown that it is in fact a mixture of both types we present the results of a search for extragalactic subdwarfs in the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole at @xmath0 , using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .<n> we find no extended sources above the expected point - like source positions in the acs images , down to a limiting surface brightness of 20 mag / arcsec@xmath1 . however , there are several extended sources in the wfpcs and foreground / double acs at similar redshifts , including the gravitationally lensed double pulsar j2109 + 5422 , and the extended background / double gc j1604 + 3909e . <n> the discovery of the gravitational lensing phenomenon @xcite , the study of the lensed source positions , as well as the general behaviour of objects in general , have been the subject of a great deal of interest in the last few years . in particular , it has been shown that the centroids of the source positions can be used to study the lensing properties of we present the results of a survey of extragalactic sub - millimetre sources using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at an angular resolution of @xmath0 .<n> the survey covers the following frequency ranges : _<n> i ) _ the galactic centre ( gc ) and its immediate surroundings , including the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) as well as the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) in the galactic plane ; _ ii _ ) the halo of the milky way ( mw ) with its bulge and extended halo ; and _ iii )<n> _ higher mass x - ray binaries ( xrbs , i.e. those with luminosities above 10 erg s@xmath1 ) that are associated with agns . in the frequency range _ i ]<n> , we find that the centroids of the distributions of the detected sources are consistent with the position of the mw and the halo components , as expected ; however , there are some significant deviations from the position predicted by the classical xrb model . <n> we also present results for the distribution of the it has been shown recently that gravitational waves ( gws ) from compact objects can be excited by radiation from nearby ( @xmath0 1 kpc ) background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .<n> however , it is not yet clear how the gw frequency is related to the agn spin frequency . in this letter<n> , we show that the adiabatic frequency of a gw can be related to its adiabaticity , i.e. , the frequency at which it reaches its maximal amplitude , by using a simple model based on the wilson - devinney theorem . <n> recently , there has been considerable interest in the study of gravitational waves from compact agn @xcite , due to the possibility of using them to study the early universe , as well as to test theories of the standard model ( sm ) of structure formation . for a compact object ,<n> the gravitational wave frequency is proportional to its mass , while for a massive object it is inversely proportional to the square of the mass of the star . since the astrophysical radiation field in agn is much higher than that of the sm , a large number of compact objects are expected",

negative mass , called a _<n> spherical fluid_. in particular , for a class of metrics that includes the spherical fluid , the bound on volume is sharp and the upper bound is the same as for the case of a scalar mass . as a consequence ,<n> we show that a spherical fluid can be approximated , up to a constant factor , by a homogeneous fluid with the same volume and the same sectional curvature as the target , provided that the metric on the target in this paper , we prove that the riemannian manifold @xmath0 , which is the exterior of a spherically symmetric , locally finite simplicial complex , is isometric to the euclidean plane .<n> we also show that this is the case for an infinite family of metrics on the sphere . <n> the study of the geometry of a sphere is one of the oldest , simplest and most fundamental problems in geometry . for a complete description of a given geometry<n> , it is sufficient to know its _ geometry _ , that is , the _ curvature _ and _ area _ of the interior as well as the exterior . on the other hand ,<n> the geometry is not complete if one does not know the boundary of the sphere itself . in this work<n> we are interested in a special class of geometrical objects that we call _ spherical _ metrics : metrics on a sphere that are _ isometric _ to the plane , i.e. , they are geodesically equivalent to the spherical metric on the interior @xcite . here<n> we will show that a spherical metric can be isometric to a sphere if and only if it is isometric given a @xmath0-dimensional compact riemannian manifold , we consider the problem of finding an area - minimizing map from a simplicial complex into a differentiable manifold that is homotopic to the boundary of the complex .<n> we show that this area - minimization problem is equivalent to finding a parameterization of the volume of a certain sphere , called the _ volume of the sphere _ , which is a function of the area of the map . as a corollary<n> we obtain a lower bound on the number of area - preserving maps that are area - minimizers within the same homotopy class as the map under consideration . <n> the area minimization problem for maps is motivated by the following question : what is the minimal area of a map that is a homotopic ( relative to a fixed boundary ) to a map on the interior of a compact , simplicial manifold ?<n> this problem has been studied in @xcite , @x , and more recently in the context of _ simplicial complexes_. in this context , the minimal areas of maps are defined as the infimum over the areas of all continuous maps that can be extended to the interior by adding a fixed number of in this paper we prove a version of the well - known result that the ricci flow on a @xmath0-dimensional compact manifold can be decomposed into a product of finitely many submanifolds .<n> more precisely , we show that for every compact riemannian manifold @xcite and for an arbitrary smooth map @x , the following are equivalent : 1 . <n> the area of the boundary of a simplicial complex is equal to the sum of the lengths of all edges of the complex divided by the number of vertices . 2 . for a map from the interior of each face of the simplicial complexes to an arbitrary differentiable manifold ,<n> the sum is equal ( or close to equal ) to the product of the length of the map restricted to each face and the area . in the latter case<n> we also show that the area - minimizing map can be extended to a minimizer of a certain homotopy class of maps , i.e. that it is homotopic to a map of area equal to its own ( relative to the map of edges ) but whose area is bounded away from the origin . the proof is based on a generalization of a result of s. we consider the following version of the ricci flow : given a map @xmath0 , we are interested in finding a map of bounded compactness of @x , that is , a map that is continuous and homotopic to the geodesic flow relative to all faces except those that are adjacent to the vertices . in this paper<n> we will show that this problem can be reduced to finding a minimizer of a certain function of the geodesic curvature .<n> this function is defined as the sum of the lengths of all edges of the boundary of the domain of the map under consideration plus a constant factor that depends only on the boundary and is equal to the area of the region under consideration when restricted to each face . as an application of these results ,<n> we are able to solve the plateau problem for the loop in the skeleta of a map on the riemann surface that is smooth on the geodesics . <n> this paper is a continuation of a paper @xcite , where we considered a family of ricci flows that were assumed to be continuous and differentiable on the real line , but were also allowed to have arbitrary self -

known result that the distance of a point from a boundary is bounded in the same way as the distance from the boundary itself is . for any convex set @x<n> , let@xmath1 be the convex set that consists of all polygons @x , vertices of which are at least two edges from each other , and vertices of in this paper we study the problem of meshing a ring to the euclidean plane .<n> we show that if the ring has finitely many edges , then it can be meshed to the plane in such a way that the mesh size of the whole ring tends to zero as the ring radius tends to infinity . <n> let @xmath0 be the number of edges of the ring @xcite . by the isoperimetric inequality ,<n> the following statement is true : if for every fixed point of the circle , there is an edge that is smaller than the injectivity radius , and the ring of edges between the edges is not too close to the ring , i.e. there is a finite subset of edges that are not too far from the ring and whose radii are at least as large as the injectivities of the edges in the two sides , than there exists an edge in the ring that is at most as small as the injectedivity radius of the edge and whose radius is larger than the ring itself . in other words , we prove the following : + c (  sigma_i_(s_i))$ ] + @x we show that the euclidean metric on @xmath0 can be parameterized by a geodesic whose intrinsic distance to the origin is smaller than the distance between the two geodesics , provided that the intrinsic distance is at least as large as the extrinsic distance .<n> we also show that if the intrinsic and extrinsic distances are of the same order , then the geodesics are geodesically decoupled . <n> the study of closed geodesics is one of the oldest and best studied topics in the geometry of closed manifolds . in this paper<n> , we consider the case where the intrinsic ( and/or extrinsic ) distance between two points on a closed manifold is bounded from below by a constant independent of their distance from the point . for a given set of points on the manifold ,<n> this constant is called the _ intrinsic _ distance , and it is defined in the paper by gauss and lindenstrauss ( see @xcite , for example ) . as such , the case of closed riemannian manifolds is well understood . on the other hand , when the manifold is open , it is natural to ask whether there exists a metric on the closed manifold that is we show that the distance between two points on the unit circle in @xmath0 $ ] is bounded from below by the angle between their geodesic segments if and only if their intrinsic distances to the first point on the circle are smaller than a certain constant .<n> we also show that this bound is sharp . <n> the study of the intrinsic distances of points in euclidean space has a long history , going back to the work of hawking and others on the riemannian geometry @xcite . for the first time<n> , there is an effort to extend this study to the non - euclidian case , starting with brukner , shapiro and zworski ( see , e.g. , [ eq : bp ] ) . in this short note<n> we establish a bound on the intrinsic distance between points in the plane that is sharper than any known bound in the literature , for the following cases : ( i ) if the distance is equal to the sum of the lengths of the geodesic segments between the two points , ( ii ) for any angle between the segments , the distance can not be smaller than the angle of the first in this paper we show that the geodesic flow in @xmath0 has a minimizer .<n> the minimizer is the intersection of the geodesic segment between two points on the boundary of the plane , with the tangent vector field at each point . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the flow of a fluid in three - dimensional space is one of the central problems of modern physics . in three dimensions ,<n> the behavior of the fluid is determined by the geometry of its boundary , i.e. by the ratio of the length of the boundary to the radius of curvature of the three dimensional space . for a straight line<n> the boundary is given by the three - sphere @xcite , while for a curved line it is usually assumed that the two - sphere is the only boundary . on the other hand , in higher dimensions<n> it is well known that the flow can be decomposed into a series of finitely many closed geodesic curves , each of which is parameterized by an angle . as shown in [ [ eq : background_forregularity]](ii ) , there exists an infinite family of parameterized boundary conditions for the flow , depending on the value of we show that the geodesic curvature of a line can be computed in terms of the first and second derivatives of its projection on the real line .<n> this is done by proving a new version of the well - known lemma on the intersection of two curves . <n> [ [ section ] ] let @xmath0 be a non - smooth , non - positive , compact , convex , self - intersecting , line segment of riemannian geometry . in this paper<n> we are interested in the following question : what is the curvature of the geodesic flow along the segment ? <n> this question was first raised in @xcite , where it was shown that for every segment there exists a geodesic flow whose curvature is equal to the first derivative of its projected curvature on the line , up to a constant error . as a consequence ,<n> there is an upper bound on the error of the projected curvature , which is linear in the distance between the segment and the line and quadratic in the length of the segment ( cf . [ eq : upper bound for regularity ] in section 1 ) . since this bound is quadratic , it is not surprising that there is no upper we consider self - intersections of the form @xmath0 in the euclidean plane .<n> we prove that the geodesic curvature of such a self - intersection is equal to the product of the first and second derivatives of the curve in a local coordinate system . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of the paper @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in geodesic curvatures that are contractible in the plane , i.e. , they are piecewise euclidian embeddings . here , the embeddings are defined in a coordinate system that is a function of the variables of the embedding , and the curvature is defined in terms of the local coordinates . we will see that the curvature of a geodesic curve is in general differentiable , in fact it can be written as a product of two terms : the first one being a lipschitz function and the second one being the derivative with respect to the projection of the geodesic curve in the coordinate system of interest . the first term is called the _ geodesic curvature_. the second term is a _ lipschit _ function and is defined as the derivative of the curvature in the projection . in this note , we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between piecewise @xmath0 self - intersecting loops in the plane and certain sle(4 ) compactly supported vector fields on the circle .<n> we use this correspondence to show that for a class of piecewise self - intersections , there is an upper bound on the dimension of the vector field that can be realized as a self - intersection of a given loop . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to prove that a vector field can be supported on a circle with dimension at most two if and only if it is self - intersectable . <n> the notion of a _ compact _ vector field was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in the context of riemannian geometry . since then , it has found numerous applications in many fields of mathematics and physics . in particular , in the case of vector fields , the compactness property has been used to prove the existence of one - parameter families of compact vector fields in the euclidean space . for example , for a compact vector field on the sphere , if the boundary of the sphere is a circle , then the boundary in this note , we give a solution of the following plateau problem : let @xmath0 be the number of loops that are piecewise riemannian and contractible in the boundary of @xcite .<n> then there are at most @x , where the right and left derivatives do nt agree , and at least one branch point in each of the irreducible representations of the moduli space . <n> in this paper we are interested in the following question : what is the maximum number of pieces that can be embedded into the boundary ?<n> this is a problem that has been studied in many different contexts , for example , see e.g. refs . in the title of the paper and references therein . for the sake of clarity ,<n> we only consider the case in which there are only finitely many left and right derivatives , but our results are general and can be applied to other cases as well . + in the paper , as a corollary of the first result , there is a solution to the plateau problem for the following non - convex boundary value problem . here<n> the left and the right derivatives are allowed to have arbitrary regularity , the regularity of which in this note we extend the results of @xcite to the case in which the distance between the two endpoints of a plateau is not equal to the sum of the distances of the two plateaus . <n> let @xmath0 be a countably infinitely many smooth piecewise euclidean space curves that are contractible in the projective plane and that have piecewise constant curvature .<n> then there is a one - parameter family of smooth self - similar curves @x , each of which satisfies the douglas - type condition : there is an open subset of the complex plane such that for every element of the family the distance from the center of @ x to the endpoint of the curve goes to zero as the dimension of the space goes to infinity . in this paper<n> we prove that if the distance to the endpoints of the plateaus is equal to its summand then the distance of the curves from the endpoints is the same , up to a constant factor , as the distance in the case where the curve is piecewise hyperbolic . as a consequence<n> we obtain the following estimates : [ thm]*v*.1 * the first author would like to thank the national science council ( nsc ) in this note , we prove the following estimate : let @xmath0 be the set of branch points of a smooth , compact , non - self - similar , discrete , hyperbolic hamiltonian system with boundary .<n> assume that the system has no singularities in the sense of the douglas - type condition . then there exists a non - singular , finitely generated , minimal surface @xcite . in this paper<n> we prove that if @x , then there exist finitely many such minimal surfaces . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain the following estimates : [ 1 ] for any compact _ self - like _ hyperbolic , smooth hamiltonians with boundary we find an estimate for the minimal surface that is equal to the sum of the logarithm of the dimension of the boundary , over all compactly contained open subsets of degree at least two , and over all _ isolated _ branch points . here<n> the dimension is defined to be the volume of the hilbert space of the system . <n> [ 2 ] the estimate is independent of the regularity of the hyperbolic system and is given in terms of the jacobi polynomials @x in this note , we prove a version of the following result : if @xmath0 is a loop in the euclidean plane such that its endpoints are within a finite distance of each other , then there exists a non - empty set of pairwise non - intersecting points in the plane whose total area is at least @xcite .<n> more precisely , there exists an open subset of the real line with the following properties : ( i ) every point in the line can be reached in a finite time , ( ii ) the distance between two points in this set can be arbitrarily large , and ( iii ) there is a set of pairs of points , bounded by two straight segments and two arcs , such that any two distinct segments do nt intersect in their interior . <n> the theorem follows from a recent work by the first author , who proved a similar result for the riemannian metric on the line . here<n> we recall the main ideas and results of that paper , as well as provide some elementary proofs . *<n> key words and phrases : * loop quantum mechanics , non - commutative geometry , douglas - type condition ,  we prove a variational identity for the self - intersection map @xmath0 in the spirit of the fundamental results of @xcite .<n> the main idea is to show that for a given collection of self - intersections , there is a unique variational property for each one of these maps . as an application<n> , we show that the volume form of the pull - back flow on the set of all spanning disks with respect to the pull-@xmath1 metric can be expressed in terms of the variational identities derived here . <n> the fundamental theorems of quantum mechanics are based on the following statement :  _ every point of a real euclidean space is a union of infinitesimally many connected components , all of which are contained in the same region of space '' . on the other hand ,<n> the corresponding statement in classical mechanics states that , for a complex hamiltonian system , each component is contained in an infinite number of non - empty segments . in the latter statement<n> it is assumed that the components of the system are invariant under the action of the symmetry group of the hilbert space , which is a very natural assumption in classical physics , but it is not we prove a variational identity for the self - intersection region of the pull - back flow on the disk @xmath0 . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]corollary [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ] example [ theorem][ theorem]remark [ section] we consider a one parameter family @xmath0 of geodesic self - intersections in the plane . here , we assume that the geodesic curvature of each self - intersection is equal to the area of the boundary .<n> we show that the family of self - intersecting geodesic curves is almost isometric to the geodesic plane , i.e. that almost every point on the plane can be reached in almost every direction . as an application of this result ,<n> we prove that there are infinitely many self - junctions for the plane that do not intersect in their endpoints . <n> the study of one parameter families ( hfs ) of geodesic curves has a long history @xcite . in particular , the well - known symmetries of the geodesic flow are the main reason for the large number of known examples of geodesic flows that are not homotopic to each other . on the other hand , there are also families of geodesic flow that are symmetric with respect to any metric , such as the euclidean geodesic flow , which has been the subject of much recent study @x<n> . one of the more interesting examples of symmetric geodesic flow is that of the riemannian geodesic flow which is a symmetric , we prove the existence and uniqueness of a one - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath0 with boundary .<n> we show that there exists a one parameter family of smooth one - parameter families @xcite of periodic boundary value problems for the schrdinger equation . in this<n> setting , the boundary value problem is closely related to the hamiltonian counterpart of the jacobi <n> bellman equation , which is known to have an infinite number of stable periodic solutions . <n> the schdinger equation is one of the most studied equations of the nonlinear differential equations . for this reason ,<n> it has been the subject of numerous papers , many of which are devoted to the proof of its existence or non - existence . on the other hand<n> , there are also many papers that deal with the study of the behavior of the solutions on the boundary , either analytically or numerically . here<n> we are interested in the case where the boundary is an interval , and we want to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions as the interval tends to infinity . the boundary case is also interesting in its own right , since it is the simplest one , in fact , because it has a very simple dynamical system  we prove a new version of the speed - of - convergence theorem in the euclidean metric , which is valid for all smooth vector fields that vanish on the unit circle .<n> the proof is based on a variation formula for the riemannian metric . <n> let @xmath0 be a smooth vector field on the circle @xcite and let @ x be the ( normalized ) position - time derivative of x at each vertex of @x<n> times [ 0 , t ] to m$ ] with respect to the metric x. then there is an open convex set , called the _ speed of convergence _ , defined as the ratio of the sum of the divergence rate of x and the rate of convergence of x over the geodesic distance . in this paper<n> we prove that for any vector field ( defined below ) on the sphere ( or any other compact subset of the circle ) at least one of the following is true : ( i ) the speed of convergent vector fields on x is equal to the speed ( in the coordinates of the sphere ) of convergence for x in the sense that the divergence of x is zero ; ( ii ) for we show that the euclidean metric @xmath0 on the real line can be decomposed into a finite set of mutually orthogonal subintervals .<n> the corresponding decomposition of the riemannian metric on the complex plane is also obtained and is shown to be identical to the corresponding one on the unit circle . <n> the main purpose of this paper is to give a complete description of the set of all possible mutually orthogonal eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic plane . in particular , we will show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenvalues of the hermitian hamiltonian of the plane and the values of the corresponding jacobian eigenvector . as a consequence ,<n> we will be able to prove that the following is equivalent to the following : @xcite . here , @x mathbbr$ ] denotes the jacobi eigenvalue of the harrison <n> zeldovich operator ,  e_k_2(u ) int_mathcalds & = bigrangle ds  , x_gamma_k_2  ( s we derive a variational principle for the free propagation of a particle in a curved space - time by expressing the variational problem in terms of integrals over a finite domain .<n> we then use this principle to derive a new version of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem , which is analogous to the standard kam theorem . as an application<n> , we show that the free energy of a quantum particle moving in space at constant speed can be expressed as the sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the speed of light , and the other is a constant that depends on the curvature of the surface . <n> _ introduction _ recently , a new theorem has been proposed by one of the authors @xcite , stating that the hamiltonian @xmath0 can be written as a convex combination of the schrdinger , klein - gordon , dirac and jacobi hamiltonians , with coefficients that are functions of space and time . here<n> we will call this new theorem the _<n> kam theorem_. in its simplest form , it states that for any continuous vector field , the variation of the free we show that a variational inequality on the set of all riemannian equations of the form @xmath0 holds almost everywhere .<n> more precisely , we prove that the following statement holds :  _ every compactly supported vector function on the real line , up to a constant factor , is a priori a summand of _ all _ the _ integrals of the scalar product of this vector function with its conjugate _ on the right hand side of the line . _<n> _ ' '' '' <n> the fact that this statement is true is a consequence of a more general statement , which we also prove . for the proof<n> we use a new , more precise version of the alexander - vlasov inequality . in this version<n> we do not make any assumptions about the boundary of the domain , except that it can be arbitrarily close to the boundary . as a consequence<n> we can prove that this inequality is true almost everywhere if we assume that the sum of the integrals over the boundary vanishes , and we can show that the statement holds almost anywhere in the domain if and only if this is the case . ' ''<n> [ theorem] in this note , we present a new proof of the existence of a one - to - one mapping @xmath0 , which is a generalization of the well - known chern - simons mapping .<n> we show that this mapping is supported in a compactly supported vector space . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to prove existence of an infinite family of one - parameter families of variational splitting functions . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the one - dimensional ( 1d ) stochastic differential equation ( sde ) is one of the most studied nonlinear equations . in its simplest form<n> , it describes the motion of a particle in a curved space , e.g. , on a ring , in a magnetic field , or in a fluid , and it can be expressed in terms of a hamiltonian @xcite . for a 1d nonlinear system , the sdes are often used to describe the dynamics of complex systems , such as complex fluids , superfluids , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , optical fibers , mechanical oscillators and so on . however , despite the importance of in this paper we prove that the area under the geodesic curvature of a compact riemannian manifold with boundary is bounded from below by the product of the area of the boundary with itself .<n> we do this by constructing a parameterization of the manifold in terms of a family of parameterizations of its geodesic curvature . <n> the concept of area under a geodesic curvature was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in his celebrated work on the geodesic flow of a fluid on a surface . in his seminal work<n> he showed that for every compactly supported continuous vector field @xmath0 , there is an open subset @x<n> to tm$ ] such that for any compactly embedded smooth manifold of characteristic zero , with boundary equal to the boundary of the surface , the following is true : there is a one -

mean - field path . <n> the study of the dynamics of a quantum system is one of the most fundamental problems in modern physics , and has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein and hawking on neutral atoms @xcite . since the discovery of bose einstein condensations ( becs ) of dilute atomic vapors , it has been of great interest to the community to study their properties , both theoretically and experimentally . at present , most of the attention is focused on the condensates as they are the we present the results of a study on the thermalization of relativistic heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .<n> we focus on the effect of the interaction energy on the dynamics of the collision and on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) of the system . in particular , we investigate the influence of the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model for the eos on the collision dynamics . we find that the rmf model is able to reproduce the experimental data very well . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collision ( rhic ) experiments are one of the most challenging problems in nuclear physics today due to the high energy collision cross section , as well as to the fact that relativistic particles are accelerated to relativistic energies @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the collisional energy of the particles is significantly larger than that of the nuclear medium , which leads to the formation of a strong correlation between the relativistic eos and the collision energy , i.e. , a correlation coefficient @xmath0 . at relativistic energies<n> this correlation can be expressed in terms of an energy correlation coefficient ( ec ) , called eos correlation coefficient , or equivalently , kinetic energy we present a new method for the calculation of the nuclear matrix element @xmath0 of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .<n> the method is based on the exact diagonalization of the time - dependent density matrix , which is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the probability distribution of the energy level difference between the two nucleons . in this way<n> , we are able to calculate the nuclear structure factor . <n> recently , it has been shown that the interaction of a single nucleon with a nuclear medium is determined by the structure of the hamiltonian , i.e. , by the matrix elements of the interaction potential . for that purpose ,<n> the so - called  nuclear matrix elements '' ( nids ) have been introduced in refs . @xcite , where they have been shown to be the equal parts of the amplitudes of the two hamiltonians in the nid - interaction potentials at the same energy level . as a consequence , the nuclear nid s are the same as the corresponding matrix elements in the single - particle basis . however , in the case of nuclear interactions , they are different from each other , and we present a new method for the determination of the phase shift between the ground state and the first excited state of a bose - einstein condensate .<n> the method is based on the calculation of a differential cross - correlation function between the excited and ground state wave functions of the condensate , which is performed in the time domain . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the case of the ising model . <n> the study of quantum many - body systems is an important topic in modern physics @xcite . in particular ,<n> recent years have seen an increasing interest in condensates of bosons , as they have been suggested as promising candidates for quantum information processing devices . among the various condensates that have been studied so far , one of the most interesting is the @xmath0-@xmath1 system , a mixture of two bose condensates . at the same time , it is well known that the dynamics of this system can not be described by a classical equation of state , due to the presence of dispersive and dissipative terms in the effective hamiltonian , such as the van der waals ( vdw ) term in the interaction potential , and we present a new approach to the study of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems .<n> the method is based on the solution of the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which describes the evolution of the system from an initial state with a given energy to a final state with zero energy . in this way<n> , we are able to obtain a generalization of the well - known landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) theory for phase transitions . as an example we consider the case of a system of two coupled oscillators where the energy difference between the two oscillators is equal to the phase difference of the initial state . <n> phase transitions ( pts ) are one of the most important phenomenon in condensed matter physics , occurring in a wide variety of systems ranging from single molecule emitters to biological cells @xcite . at a fundamental level ,<n> pt is defined by the energy gap between the ground state energy and the energy of the excited state @xmath0 , where the system is described by the hamiltonian , i.e. the eigenvalue spectrum of the ground - state wave function . on the other hand , we present a new method for the determination of the nuclear matrix element @xmath0 of the nucleon .<n> the method is based on the calculation of the matrix elements of nucleon propagators , which are known to be very sensitive to the form of the pion - nucleon force in nuclei . in this method ,<n> the nucleons are treated as point - like , so that the pionic part of the wave function is known , while the s - wave part is not . <n> we apply the method to the study of two nucleon systems : the proton - nucleus and the nucleus - nucleus collisions . for both systems , we find that the calculated nuclear matrix elements are in good agreement with the available experimental data , except for the case of the proton , where the calculated values are significantly larger than the data . we present a calculation of the ground state and excited state probabilities of the @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice .<n> we find that , contrary to the case of the ising model , both the ground and the excited states are exponentially localized in the region of the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition . in the limit of a large number of spins ,<n> the density - matrix renormalization group approach is able to reproduce the results of the exact diagonalization . <n> _ introduction : _ the problem of the emergence of the quantum spin liquid phase from the anti - ferromagnetic phase is one of the most important problems in the field of strongly correlated quantum matter @xcite . to this end<n> , it has been widely studied in the last few years both theoretically and experimentally , using both the mean - field theory ( mft ) and the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods . however , despite the success of the qmc approach in the description of the low - energy properties of the spin liquid , there are still many open questions , such as the robustness of the transition to the quantum paramagnetic phase , the degree of localization of we present a new approach to the calculation of the ground and excited states of a spinor bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .<n> the method is based on the solution of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the bec wave function , supplemented by an effective hamiltonian that describes the non - equilibrium dynamics of the condensate . in this way<n> we are able to calculate the ground state and excited state wave functions in a unified way . as a result<n> , we can calculate the energy spectrum of the system . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of spinor bec in condensed matter systems @xcite , due to its potential application in quantum computation and quantum information processing . among the various theoretical proposals ,<n> one of the most promising is the so - called  no - core ' bec model , which assumes that the bosonic modes of a bec form a bound state of a fermionic condensate @xmath0 . for this model<n> there exist a number of analytical and numerical works , some of which can be found in the recent literature , for example , in the paper by t. we derive the bloch - redfield master equation for a particle confined in a harmonic oscillator and subject to a time - dependent external potential .<n> the master equation is solved numerically for the case of a sinusoidally modulated external potential and an arbitrary angle between the sinusoidal modulation and the wave vector of the particle . <n> the aim of this work is to study the effect of an external potential on the dynamics of a system of classical particles confined in an harmonic oscillator . in the past few years<n> , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) harmonic oscillators @xcite . due to the high degree of experimental control over the parameters of the system , it has been possible to perform a number of interesting experiments , such as the first observation of a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of ultracold atoms in 1d optical lattices and the first experimental investigation of the effects of strong repulsive interactions on the formation of a one - dimensional bose gas . at the same time , there is a growing interest in the theoretical investigation of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum particles confined in this paper , we study the effect of an external magnetic field on bloch - redfield equilibrium in a quantum spin system .<n> we find that the presence of the magnetic field has a profound effect on the dynamics of the system , which can be used to control the degree of thermalization of the quantum spin state . <n> quantum spin systems ( qss ) are systems in which the spin of a single electron is coupled to the motion of the rest of the electrons in the lattice @xcite . in these systems ,<n> the electron spins interact with each other through the exchange of quantum information , known as the heisenberg exchange interaction ( hei ) . as a result<n> , the electron spin fluctuates in time due to the interaction between the electron and the lattice , and the system can be driven out of equilibrium by an applied magnetic field . on the other hand , in the absence of a magnetic field<n> the electrons do not exchange information with the lattice but with the vacuum , called the quantum - classical ( qc ) interaction . since the first proposal of the hei in qc systems @xmath0 years ago , there has been a great deal of interest we propose a method to measure the position of a photon by measuring the photon absorption spectrum .<n> the method is based on the application of a phase shift detector to a two - level atom interacting with an electromagnetic field . for a given photon<n> , the absorption spectrum can be determined by measuring a pair of quadrupole moments of the atom , which are related to the positions and momenta of the two photon bound states . in this way , we can determine the quadrupolar moment of the bound state . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of two - photon ( 2p ) absorption in various physical systems @xcite , such as quantum dots , quantum wires , and semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , as well as in quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite and quantum communication ( qc ) systems . to measure these absorption spectra ,<n> it is necessary to apply a phase - shift detector ( psd ) to the two bound states of the system . the standard method for such a measurement is to apply the phase shift @xmath0 to the bound states and then measure the total absorption spectrum we show that the ground state of the two - component bose - einstein condensate in the presence of an external magnetic field exhibits a topological phase transition .<n> the phase transition is characterized by a change of the sign of the winding number of the gapless edge of the condensate and by the appearance of a gap in the excitation spectrum of the system . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose gas and a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) @xcite . in 2d systems ,<n> the qpt can be induced by a transverse magnetic field @xmath0 , which is perpendicular to the plane of the 2d condensate , and/or by an applied uniform magnetic field , while in 3d , the field is parallel to the condensate . for a system of two counter - rotating particles , such as a spinor bose condensate and a spinless fermi gas , it is well known that the system undergoes a qpt when the coupling between the two components is tuned from the weak to the strong coupling regime . on the other hand , in a system we study the effect of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions on the vibrational properties of a simple model system , the ising spin chain .<n> we find that these interactions can lead to an increase of the vibrational frequencies of the system and an overall reduction of the phonon lifetimes . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the investigation of properties of simple quantum systems , such as atoms , molecules , and nanoparticles , which are composed of a large number of weakly interacting particles . in these systems<n> there is a strong correlation between the properties of the particles and their interactions with each other . on the other hand , in the presence of strong correlations ,<n> the dynamics of these systems can be very complicated , leading to a variety of interesting phenomena . for example , it has been shown that the motion of the electrons in a quantum wire can be described by the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite , where the electrons are described by a set of coupled harmonic oscillators ( ho s ) . however , this is not the case for the electrons , as they can also interact with other degrees of freedom , e.g. , we study the ground state properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice by means of the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( tddmrg ) method .<n> we find that the ground - state energy and the singlet and triplet excitation energies are strongly dependent on the strength of the anisotropy of the interactions between the spins . in the case of the ising model , the triplet and singlet excitations are degenerate , while the spin - orbit interaction gives rise to a gap in the excitation spectrum . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) quantum spin system @xcite , due to its potential application in spintronics and quantum information processing . at present , most of the theoretical work on this system is based on the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , which assumes that the spins are aligned parallel to the direction of the magnetization . on the other hand , it is also well known that the anisotropic interactions between spins can lead to the appearance of long - range order in the magnetic response of the we investigate the quantum statistical properties of a two - level atom interacting with a resonantly - pumped optical cavity field .<n> we focus on the regime where the cavity frequency is in the strong coupling regime , where the atom - cavity system can be described by the bloch - siegert ( bs ) model . in this regime<n> , the bs model can be mapped onto the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which is solved numerically to obtain the cavity occupation numbers and the two - point correlation functions . for strong coupling , we find that the cavity occupancy and the photon - photon correlation functions exhibit power - law dependence on the coupling strength , with the exponents depending on the strength of the resonantly pumped field , @xmath0 , and on the relative phase between the cavity and the cavity modes , t@xmath1 . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of cavity - enhanced processes @xcite , due to their potential applications in many areas of science and technology , such as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum information processing ( qip ) @x<n> . however",

[ [ section ] ] since the discovery of the z boson at the tevatron @xcite , the study of its properties has been one of the main topics of the lep program . in particular , it is important to understand its properties , in particular its mass , its coupling to the higgs boson and to the qcd vacuum . <n> [ [ rsum . * ? ?<n> * ] in section 1 ] we consider the production of leading jets in

describing the hadronic recoil of the leading jet ; and ( iii ) at lo , the data are better described by the mpi scale parameter , rather than by that of the optmization . in the process of hadron - hadron scattering @xcite , a _<n> z_-boson is produced in association with a jet , which is recoiling against a hard parton in the final state . at the lhc ,<n> this process is expected to be dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion process , with a large cross section due to gluon jets . however , in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) region , where one expects a large fraction of the we

for the production of one , two , three and four jets . <n> one of the main goals of the lhcb experiment is the study of the properties of the lightest higgs boson @xcite . in the case of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) ,<n> the _<n> z_-boson is the most precise observable , because it is the only scalar boson that is massless and it decays into a pair of electroweak gauge bosons , the so - called higgsinos . for the  electroweak scale '' , below the tev scale , this is the dominant decay mode , which allows us to measure its properties with great accuracy . at higher

couplings . among the three monte - carlo ( we report on the comparison of the monte carlo generators @xmath0 and _ _ z _ at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , for the production of one , two , and three jets in hadronic collisions at the lhc ( 7 tev ) and the tevatron ( 8 t ev ) .<n> the comparison is performed in the electron and muon channels . in the muon channel ,<n> the agreement is better between the two generators , with mpi simulation , than between them with optimized pdfs , scale parameter 2.5 gev . <n> title=\"fig : \"<n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we present comparison plots for the cross section as a function of jet multiplicity , energy and transverse momentum , between the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) generators monte - carlo ( mc ) @xcite and nlo ( nnlo)/pqcd ( n@xmath1 ) formalisms . here<n> , we focus on the jet multiplicities in the quark - parton model ( qpm we present a comparison of @xmath0 _ _ z _ production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions for the gluon density in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .<n> we use the monte - carlo event generator ( mcex ) to simulate the lhc for proton - proton , proton - antiproton , and nucleus - nucleus collisions in the electron , jet and heavy quark channels . for the nlo qcd<n> , we compare the production cross - sections and transverse momenta of the perturbatively corrected _<n> z_-measured hadrons , the leading quarkonia , their invariant masses and the transverse momentum spectra of the leading jets . <n> the study of the properties of the strongly interacting matter produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is an important step towards understanding the qcd dynamics in the strongly - interacting medium . in recent years ,<n> a number of theoretical studies have been carried out to investigate the structure of qcd matter at high energies @xcite . among these studies<n> are the we present the results of a monte carlo simulation of @xmath0 _ _ z _ production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the electron channel .<n> the calculation is performed for the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) collinear effective theory , and for the nlo pion - exchange model with the radiative corrections taken into account . <n> we present results for the production cross section and rapidity distribution of @ x(3872 ) gev@xmath1 , inclusively and in the jet channel , for the lhc energy range of 7 tev , as well as for the higher energies available at rhic ( 14 tevatron ) and the international linear colliders ( ilc ) . in the context of heavy - ion collisions , the study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is of interest both for the fundamental understanding of the qgp and also for the technological applications , such as the simulation of superconducting circuits @xcite . at high energies ,<n> the production of quarks and gluons in high - energy collisions is dominated by gluon we present the results of a monte - carlo simulation of @xmath0 _ _ z _ production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the monte carlo ( mc ) code , pythia , is used to simulate the lhc ( 7 tev ) energy and the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition , including the production of the qgp gluons and quarks , and the subsequent hadronization of the produced hadrons . in particular , we focus on electron and jet production in the channels : _<n> z_@xmath1 production , for which we compare the mc results with mpi simulation . we find that pythia provides a good description of the electron production at lhc energy , especially for large values of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the jets . <n> the study of the phase diagram of qcd in the presence of a strongly - interacting qgp is an important step towards the understanding of strong - interaction physics and the formation of a qcd - like deconfined state . at present<n> , there is a strong evidence for the existence of we present the _ z _ production in hadron colliders at 7 tev center - of - mass energy , in the channels : electron , muon and jet .<n> we compare the monte carlo simulation results with the tevatron data in the region of mid - range transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson , and show that it is possible to choose a good tune for the parameters of the mpi and mpi+@xmath1 generators . in the muon channel , we study the effects of adding a matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism , improving the prediction of the cross sections of the processes , as well as the behaviour of the physics observables . <n> we show that the use of the nlo term , studied here in the @math1 formalism as implemented in the sdss generator , improves the prediction for the cross section of the process , compared to the one performed in the electron channel in leading order . the implementation of the matrix element corrections in the component element formalism also improves the description of the data in high transverse momentum region . finally , the underlying event analysis showed a systematic behaviour lower we present a comparison of the tevatron and lhc data for _ z _ production in the electron and muon channels , using the @xmath0 , and the nlo monte carlo event generators @xcite .<n> the electron channel analysis shows that it is possible to choose a good tune for the parameters in the multiple parton interactions model ( amisic ) for the @ x generator , by choosing a pdf that best describes the transverse momentum and multiplicity of the lepton pair . in the muon channel ,<n> the mpi model gives a better description of the data than the standard one , based on the best description of other physics observables by the authors . <n> the analysis for lhc first run energy ( 7 tev ) shows that some kinematic quantities have a different prediction when compared to the calculations in leading order , with the leading jet being pseudorapidity independent in the region of low transverse momentum . the study of the shape of the jet , as well as the influence of adding a matrix element correction in the leading order calculations for improving the showering in the parton shower formalism , should give some information on the shapes of the jets . in this work , we compare the predictions of the monte carlo event generators @xmath0 and @xcite for some observables that will be measured at the lhc , namely , jet production cross sections , and differential distributions .<n> the comparison is done in two steps . in the first step ,<n> the _ z _ boson transverse momentum and the leading jet and the sum of the transverse momentum of all jets in the event are compared for both generators , with and without multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) , in order to see the effects that the mpi model have in the region of low transverse momentum . a full comparison once lhc has enough luminosity will show some features that both generators will have to deal with , implementing in their processes new information that the new data will provide . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the second step of the comparison , some kinematic quantities , such as the differential distributions and the jet multiplicities , are compared between the two generators for some selected observables , to see how well they are able to reproduce the underlying event data . for example , for the cross section of jet production we analyze the _ z _ @xmath0 , and the leading jet , in tevatron and lhc data , to see if the mpi model is consistent with the data .<n> we find that , with mpi turned on in the generators , the behaviour is very similar to that without mpi , except for the sum of jets , which shows a systematic difference . <n> the mc and mpi models give very different predictions for the transverse momentum of the particles in the jets . in the case of mpi<n> , we do not find a fundamental balance between _<n> z_@xmath1 and the transverse momenta of all jets in the event , even though the data are consistent with a balance , for both mc and mc+mpi models . for the tev scale physics ,<n> the difference between mpi and mc is negligible , but for higher energies , mpi is necessary to explain the data<n> . however , if we turn on mpi in the mc generator , there is a fundamental difference in the behaviour of _ s _ and _ b _ at the lhc , especially for the we report on the analysis of events with @xmath0 , _ z _ , and leading jets , with mpi turned on , for the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the cuts on the events are : leading jet plus one jet plus two jets plus one leading jet , leading jet minus two jets and one jet minus one jet . <n> we find that , at the lhc with 14 tev of data , there is no evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and that the sm is strongly disfavored . in the absence of new physics , the mass of the lightest higgs boson is expected to be between 115 gev and 200 gev , depending on the model , which means that the masses of the higgs and the sm particles are not necessarily the same . the mass range between 125 gev to 200 gevs is excluded at 95% confidence level ( cl ) in the minimal susy model ( mssm ) @xcite . at the same time , in the sm , it is expected that the lightest neutralino should be massless and should have we present a new analysis of jets in @xmath0 collision data , with the aim of searching for a signal of new physics at the large hadron collider .<n> this analysis , based on monte carlo simulations , is performed with mpi turned off , and requires at least one jet . <n> the search is performed in two steps . in the first step ,<n> tevatron data are used to constrain the parameter space , then the data are converted to lhc energies and compared to theoretical predictions . at the end of the second step<n> , the lhc data are transformed to a data sample , which is then compared to the theoretical prediction . for a better comparison , we also make one - dimensional projections of the plots for different _ z _ and _<n> z@xmath1 _ bins . the search for new physics in heavy ion collisions is one of the main goals of the lhgss and atlas / cms collaborations @xcite . with its high luminosity and angular resolution , atlas and cms will be able to perform a detailed study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  we perform a model independent analysis of drell - yan production at the tevatron and find that the best description of the data is given by the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model .<n> we also perform the same analysis at the lhc , and find a better description by the @xmath0 model , which is more compatible with the data . <n> the drell yan ( dy ) process @xcite is one of the best studied processes at hadron colliders . in the framework of the standard model ( sm )<n> , it is well known that the quark , gluon and quarkonium states produced in the collision of two high energy hadrons can be described by a dy with a mass of the order of the weak scale , as well as by a higgs boson of mass of order the gravitino mass , with a coupling constant of order 1 gev@xmath1 and a width of order 10 tev . the radiative corrections to the production cross section of the dy<n> are of the same order of magnitude as in the sm , but with a much weaker dependence on the coupling constants we present the results of a study of the drell yan production in @xmath0 annihilation using the monte carlo generators pythia and phoebe .<n> we compare the results with the tevatron analysis and find that the two generators give very different predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the produced bosons . <n> this paper is a continuation of the work initiated in ref.@xcite . in ref . @xcite<n> , we presented the results from a study on the production of three different bosons in proton - antiproton collisions , using the pythia generators . here<n> we present results on the three - body decays of the three bosons and their transverse momentum distributions , as well as on the two - body drell - yan lepton - pair production , which is the main source of information for the extraction of the b - quark mixing angle . for more details on the calculations and a table of results , see the paper @x<n> . we will summarize the results in the following table : [ fig.1 ] . with the high luminosity data collected at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national we present a study of the transverse momentum distribution of inclusive jets in @xmath0 collisions at tevatron and lhc energies .<n> the study is based on three different jet generators : the monte carlo generators @xcite , 3slices '' , and monte - carlo  mpi '' models , which were developed in the framework of perturbative qcd at the hadron level . in this work<n> , we focus on the differences between  z '' and the leading jet distributions , on the difference between the  3slice '' and  2slice''-based analyses , as well as on the mpi model effects . <n> one of the most important features of the lhc physics program is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . to this end , the atlas and cms collaborations have performed a number of analyses that can be considered benchmarked against sm predictions . among these analyses<n> are the study of transverse momentum distributions of inclusive hadrons produced in association with leptons , photons , or quarks , a search for the higgs boson , an important test of the we present a selection of recent d0 and cdf @xmath0 results .<n> we use two different monte carlo event generators , sherpa and mpi , and compare their predictions . <n> one of the main goals of the tevatron is to measure the properties of the lightest higgs boson @xcite . at low transverse momenta ,<n> the lhc provides the best opportunity for this goal , as the lqcd prediction for the mass of this particle is very close to the measured value . in order to discriminate between different models of the higgs , it is important to have a good understanding of the production mechanisms of the different particles , especially in the low transverse momentum region , which is very difficult to measure experimentally . to this end<n> , the cdf and d0 collaborations have performed a number of interesting measurements , such as the measurement of the gluon density in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , of the ratio of drell - yan to bottom - quark pair production in the z - boson mass region ( z=1 - 5 gev ) in p - p collisions , azimuthal asymmetry of the d0 collaboration at the fermilab tevatron collider has measured the transverse momentum distribution of z - bosons produced in p+p collisions at @xmath0 tev .<n> the data were analyzed using the monte - carlo event generator sherpa , and were combined with data from cdf and d0 to extract the z-@xmath1 differential cross section as a function of transverse momentum , transverse momentum and rapidity . in this letter<n> , we present the results of the analysis , which was performed using the event - by - event generator pythia . <n> the measurement of the z - anti - z production cross section in p - p collisions @xcite has been of considerable interest , both because it is a sensitive test of qcd and because it can be used to extract information about the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in these collisions . to obtain this result ,<n> cdf used the event generator herwig to perform a simulation of the reaction system , in which the z bosons are produced in the initial state and then decay into two pions , one of them decaying into a pion and the",

it orients the fibers and the plane field and hence orients both the fiber and the link according to the convention : at a point in the fiber , let @xcite be a 1-form with a transverse kernel . a transverse _<n> vector field<n> _ ( also called _ contact _ field ) is _ well - defined _ if it is transverse to both the plane and the fiber field . in this note we define a new class of fibered contact forms , the _ nicely fibered class _ , which generalizes the class of contact forms defined in @xcite .<n> the class is a natural extension of the well - known fibered classes , and we give some examples . <n> contact forms are one of the simplest dynamical systems on which one can study the geometry and topology of a complex manifold . in the case of a compact manifold , such as the euclidean space @xmath0 ,<n> the most familiar form of contact geometry is that of a _ contact vector field _ @x , defined on all of the connected components of the manifold : the fibers of a transverse link . here<n> , we will focus on contact forms on compact symplectic manifolds , called _ fibers _<n> ; in this case we will recall that the usual definition of a fiber is the set of normal coordinates on a closed neighborhood of the fiber , in the sense that if we start with a fiber and let it cross the boundary of the space , then we can define a characteristic foliation on the boundary , with coordinates given by the normal coordinates . the we show that for any legendrian knot @xmath0 there exists a convex symplectic @xcite-@xmath1-manifold @x , with induced contact structure @ x , whose boundary is symplectically extended by attaching a symplectomorphism from a neighborhood of @ x to a new neighborhood of the knot .<n> this extends a result of weinstein , who gave a similar result in the case of stein manifolds . <n> the notion of an induced contact form ( i.e. , a form that connects two manifolds in a canonical way ) was introduced by eliashberg in his study of the geometry of contact manifolds , and has since found numerous applications . in this paper<n> we consider the more general setting of induced contact forms , in which the manifolds are not necessarily  convex .

compact manifold . we also show that this result is we show that every legendrian knot in a positive symplectic @xmath0-manifold can be isotoped into a convex knot with an induced tight contact structure .<n> the isotoped knot is also tight with respect to any fibration of the manifold . as an application<n> , we give new proofs of results of eliashberg and weinstein , and we prove a conjecture of lewenstein . <n> [ [ section ] ] this paper is the continuation of a series of papers @xcite , beginning with a proof of the existence of symplectomorphisms between legendrian knots in positive sympcessions . in section [ t : cvx2ccv ]<n> we prove that given any compact knot in an affine space , there exists a compact knot with induced contact structure on the boundary of the space . for the proof ,<n> we use the thurston - bennequin framing of the knot , as well as the notion of a _ concave boundary _ , introduced by a. gompf in his work on symplecticity . here , the convexity of the boundary is measured by the number of 1-handles we show that every contact structure on a symplectic @xmath0-manifold can be realized as the convex boundary of a concave boundary of an associated symplectics @xcite .<n> in particular , we prove that every fibered contact structure in a @x <n> s _ contact 3-manifold _ is the contact structure of a convex boundary . as a consequence ,<n> we construct many new contact structures , including legendrian and smooth knots and links , on the boundary of symplectically filling @x<n> _ compact _ , _ open _ 3-mani folds . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the notion of a _ symplectomorphism _ was introduced by a. gompf in his work on symplectisms and contact structures on @x weyl manifolds , and it plays an important role in our understanding of fibered manifolds . in the mid 1990 s<n> , a. weyl introduced a new type of fibering , the _ fibered symplecton _<n> : a compact , connected , fibered , symplectonic , @x affine manifold , which is a we construct a new class of fibered symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .<n> these constructions are based on a technique which we call _ dilation -

dimensional manifold , to name a few . as an example of the application of our techniques we will prove the following result : given a compact , connected , symplectically embedded , smooth manifold with a boundary we construct a convex dilation which is transverse to the level sets of the manifold we prove weak convexity of the @xmath0-handle for transverse knots and links .<n> we do this by constructing a symplectic dilation of the contact forms induced by the transverse links and knots , which is transverse to the level sets of the original links and does not extend across the transverse knots . <n> we consider the problem of attaching a given transverse knot or link to a point in a lower dimensional space . in this context<n> , we will recall the definition of a _<n> weak _ convexity : a convexity that is weak in the sense that it does not depend on the dimension of the space in which the link or knot is attached , but it is weak everywhere else . here<n> we will consider the case where the link is a transverse or a longitudinal knot or a link and the point is a lower - dimensional space called the _ <n> transverse _ or _ longitudinal _ handle . for a transverse knot , link , or link<n> @xcite , a weak , convexity is defined by the fact that any two transverse links in the same space can be connected by a transverse link in the other space , and any two longitudinal links in another space can we construct a new class of forward flow lines for knots in the plane .<n> these flows are defined by a symplectic dilation @xmath0 defined on the open field of interest , and they are transverse to the level sets of the associated contact forms . <n> the purpose of this paper is to show that there is a one to one correspondence between forward flow along a given knot and the contact forms induced by it . in particular , we show that if a knot is a forward flow line , then it is isomorphic to a contact form induced by the symplectically dilated knot . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that a knot can be nontrivially connected to a point if and only if it can be connected to all the way to the origin . a knot in the planar plane<n> is said to be _ forward _ if it flows from one point on the plane to another without flowing across them . for a general planar knot<n> , forward flow is defined by the following equation : @xcite . on the right hand side of this equation<n> there is an associated equation called the _ weakvfield _ equation , which is defined on @ we construct a new symplectic structure on @xmath0 , which we call the _ weak contact manifold _ , and we use it to define a new type of contact surgery on the transverse links of the contact 3-manifold . <n> the weak contact structure is a generalization of the well - known contact manifolds .<n> the main difference is that we use a nondegenerate forward flow structure , rather than a contact structure . in this paper<n> , we give a new construction of weak contact structures and we prove a number of results , including a new formula for the contact number of a contact manifold in terms of the number of its transverse links , a new proof of the fact that any contact manifold can be embedded into a new contact manifold via a contact surgery , an upper bound for the dimension of a symplectically invariant manifold in the three - dimensional case , as well as a lower bound on the size of the minimal number of transverse links needed to attach a given contact manifold to a three - manifold . the notion of a weak manifold is a powerful tool in many areas of physics , from fluid dynamics to condensed matter physics . for a description of a manifold ,<n> let @x we construct a new symplectic manifold @xmath0 with nondegenerate transverse links on the boundary of a disk in the complex plane .<n> the transverse links are arranged in such a way that each transverse link is a legendrian knot , and the new manifold has a natural  contact surgery '' interpretation . <n> the construction is inspired by the work of a. a. weinstein , who showed that if a transverse link on a disk is legendrian , then it can be embedded as a contact manifold in a new , symplectically  compact '' symplectomorphism of the disk . in this paper , we show that the same can be done for any transverse link , provided that the transverse link has a  fat '' ( i.e. , compact ) configuration . as a corollary ,<n> we obtain a new proof of a result of s. aharony , which states that if two transverse links in a disk are legendrian then they have to be connected by at least one more transverse link in order to attach their respective contact manifolds @xcite . here<n> we give an alternative proof of this result , based on a more general construction of a we construct symplectic @xmath0-handles on the three - dimensional torus with a prescribed contact structure .<n> these surgeries are obtained from legendrian surgeries on the torus by replacing the radius of the disk by the radius on the disk , and they are obtained by twisting the symplectomorphism past a meridian . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a sequel to @xcite , where we showed how to construct a family of surgeries which are not legendrian . here<n> we give a different proof of this fact , which is based on the theory of partially convex and partially concave boundaries . in the proof<n> , we use a variant of the selberg - rogaway construction , in which we replace a disk with a cylindrically symmetric boundary . as a corollary<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that the hausdorff dimension of a compact riemannian manifold is at least four . for the proof of proposition [ p : cvxvrs ] ,<n> we start with the construction of a symplectically compact , partially convex , contact - type boundary , defined in @x , for which there is a symp we construct a symplectic @xmath0-handle with a dilation - contraction pair transversely covering a compact subset of the complex projective plane .<n> we show that the contact pair is uniquely determined by the germ of the symplectimetric form . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @xcite , where we defined a new type of symplectically invariant contact pairs . in this paper<n> , we define a new class of contact pairs which we call _ partially convex and partially concave _ , and show that they are in one - to - one correspondence with certain partially convex symplectomorphisms . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that a contact pair can be embedded transversely in a certain partially concave symplecty , which in turn implies a new construction of a hamiltonian system on the complex plane , called a _<n> partially convex _ partial riemannian system , on which we can define symplectics . for this purpose<n> we introduce a class of partially convex boundary conditions and define a symmetrized form on the boundary of the partially convex part of the  in this paper , we show that the symplectic manifold @xmath0 , equipped with a contact pair , can be symplectically embedded into an open subset of the complex projective plane @xcite .<n> the embedding is induced by a dilation - contraction pair on the contact pair induced by the reeb vector field on @x , and it is a special case of the lie equivalence theorem of haglund , khanin and leibbrandt [ j. math . <n> phys . * 53 * ( 2000 ) , 3966 ] . in this note<n> we will show that there is an embedding of a symplectimetric manifold which is endowed with a ( contact ) pair and which is symplectomorphic to an open set in the complex plane , called the _ projective space_.<n> this is a generalization of the well - known _ plane _ embedded in the space of real euclidean 3-manifolds , which was studied by lieberman [ j .- f. lieberman , soc . j. mod . anal . a *<n> 15 * ( 1978 ) p.3 ] and we prove that the hamiltonian @xmath0 on the unit cube of the complex projective plane has a unique solution .<n> the unique solution is given in terms of dilation - contraction pairs . <n> this paper is a sequel to @xcite . in that paper<n> we proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the hyperbolic schrdinger equation on the complex plane . here<n> we prove the existence of unique solutions in the case of the quartic quartic hamiltonians on the real line , and also prove the uniqueness of the solution in the general case . as a corollary of the first result , we are able to show that the projective space is invariant under the action of the linear group . on the other hand , as a consequence of the second result<n> , it follows that the space is also invariant _ along _ the real axis , which is an extension of the well - known result for the real plane , namely , that there is a unique _<n> solution _ to the equation [ e : commutator ] , along which the riemann tensor of the real part vanishes . for the purpose of this paper , let we prove that the symplectic form @xmath0 in the complex plane is symplectically isomorphic to the dilation - contraction pair @xcite .<n> this gives a partial answer to a question of tao . <n> the aim of this paper is to prove a partial solution to the following question : what is the geometry of the space of complex numbers ?<n> is there a geometric structure that is invariant under the action of a general symmetry group ? in this paper , we study a symmetry group which is the group of real numbers . in particular we are interested in symmetry groups that are isometric to the real plane , and in this respect we are also interested in a symmetry that is isometric to a complex number space , which we will call the _ hamiltonian _ group . for a general class of symmetry groups ,<n> we will see that there is a natural way to define a _ subgroup _ of this group , called the  subgroup of isomorphisms '' . as in the case of the real number space<n> , there is an associated subgroup of the symmetry group that can be described as follows : we define a group of isosceles triangles that we prove a uniqueness result for symplectic @xmath0-handles arising from dilation - contraction pairs transversely covering a symplectically invariant symplecto - geometric 3-manifold .<n> the uniqueness result is a consequence of a more general result we prove in a companion paper . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]corollary [ theorem]proposition [ theorem ] definition [ theorem][ theorem]remark this paper is a continuation of the author s paper @xcite , where we proved a uniqueness and uniqueness result in the symplectonic case . in that paper , we proved the existence of a unique pair of vector fields , each of which is a dilation - contractive pair transverse to an invariant vector field . here<n> we prove the same result in a more direct fashion . in this note , we show how to construct symplectic @xmath0-handles for contact pairs on partially convex and partially concave ( contact - free ) 2-manifolds .<n> we then use these handles to give a new proof of the contact - pair vanishing theorem in @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the vanishing theorem of saffman and zamolodchikov in [ j. chem . phys<n> . * 124 * ( 2000 ) , 014101 ] is a fundamental result in the theory of knots and links . in this theorem ,<n> a knot is considered to be knot - free if and only if it can be decomposed into two parts , one of which is symplectically embedded in the other . as such<n> , it is not surprising that contact pair vanishing is related to the vanishing of the corresponding morse function . on the other hand , in [ s : weakcvxbdries ] , a contact pair is _ non - vanishing _ if it is invariant under a certain deformation , called a _<n> weakcv _ , of the knot . a in this paper , we give a new construction of weak @xmath0-surgeries which does not require the coordinate system to be  fat enough '' with respect to the chosen framing . <n> the construction is based on the following observation .<n> given any symplectic knot with boundary which is partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair 1 , there exists a handle 2 , such that the induced pair on the boundary of the knot is prepared for surgery with structural data 1 . in this case<n> , the handle can be attached along an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a neighborhood of the boundary , and this neighborhood can be chosen so as to cover the whole boundary . as an application of this construction ,<n> we show that for any knot in a weak knot surjection , with all induced contact pairs bounded below and at most one induced pair positive , if there is a surgery procedure which prepares the knot for surgery in at most two places , then there is an induced pair of positive curvature on the knot which makes this surgery feasible . the first author was motivated by the work of srinivasan ( see @xcite for a review ) , who showed that for every knot @x we prove that every symplectic @xmath0-manifold with boundary which is partially convex and partially concave with induced contact pair is prepared for surgery under certain conditions .<n> in particular , we show that for any transversely symmetric knot @xcite , there exists a symplectically @x conjugate to it which is transverse to the induced contact structure on the boundary , and such a knot is well - behaved with respect to forward flow . in this paper<n> we prove the following theorem . <n> [ s : weakcvxbdries]@xmath1 there is a notion of a weak contact structure ( wcs ) on a compact riemannian manifold , defined as the set of induced contact pairs on its boundary . here<n> , the cws of a compact manifold is defined by its induced contact structures , which in turn are defined by the induced coordinates on the manifold . for a compact torus ,<n> the weak contact structures are the symplectics of the torus itself , while for a sphere , they are the induced coordinate systems on the sphere itself . the weak cvs is a powerful tool in the study of the geometry of compact , in this paper we give a method for attaching arbitrary handles to well - behaved transverse knots .<n> in particular , we will show that if a given contact pair @xmath0 on a transverse knot is prepared for surgery with respect to a given coordinate system , then there is a way to attach arbitrary handles , provided that the surgery is performed on a sufficiently small neighborhood of the knot . <n> this paper is a sequel to @xcite , where we showed how to attach handles to knots , and in this sequel we showed that attaching a handle can turn a well - behaving knot into a knot which is ready for surgery . here<n> we show that the same is true for attaching arbitrarily small handles . in this note<n> we will present a method to turn a given pair of handles into arbitrary small neighborhoods of knots so that they are prepared for surgeries under certain conditions , which we will call the _ surgery conditions _ ; in other words , if we fix a coordinate system on a knot and let it be well behaved , it will be possible to attach a handle to it and then turn the resulting knot into an even smaller knot and then fix it for surgery<n> . then we will see that if the surgery suppose that @xmath0 is a transverse knot with a small neighborhood in a symplectic @xcite-@xmath1-manifold . in this paper<n> we prove that if the induced contact pair is transverse to both vector fields , then there exists a surgery procedure that prepares the transverse knot for surgery .<n> in particular , we show that for every transverse knot there is a contact pair which is well - behaved with respect to structural data on the complement of the knot , and which is also transverse to the natural projection of the induced vector field . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a sequel of a paper by the same authors , written in collaboration with jrgen schukraft and piotr przytycki . for more information on the paper and the proofs , see the references in section [ sec : general ] . suppose that @xmath0 is a partially convex and partially concave induced contact pair on a symplectic two - dimensional manifold .<n> we prove that the induced contact vector field on @xcite is transverse to the induced hamiltonian vector field . as an application<n> , we show that there exists a closed tubular neighborhood of @x , a constant @x<n> _ l _ , and a diffeomorphism [ a : c : wellbenlarge ] along the axis of symmetry , with induced contact form [ e : xvrs2v ] . <n> introduction [ sec : intro ] the concept of a _ contact pair _ was introduced by s. hamilton in his celebrated _ equations of motion_. in these equations ,<n> he begins by defining the _ anosov form _ for a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) on a surface , which he then uses to obtain information about the structure of the manifold under consideration ( see , e.g. , refs . [ a and b ] in the introduction to this paper ) . in the course of developing this idea , s we study the concavity of a tubular neighborhood of the symplectic three - manifold @xmath0 , where the transverse contact vector field is a constant and the fibration is a diffeomorphism .<n> we show that there exists a closed tubular neighborhood @xcite of @x<n> 2$ ] , a constant , and a constant diffeomorphic to a constant @x , such that the set of all constants is isomorphic to the set 3  $ ] of constants of the three - dimensional symplecticity . in this paper<n> , we will show that if we fix a constant in the transverse field , then there is an induced negative contact form on the boundary which is well - behaved near the new boundary . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain that there is a non - trivial closed neighborhood of concavities of the form @xmath1  , endaligned, ]<n> ] where the constant is a function of the modulus of the induced contact form . <n> the notion of a  tubular neighborhood '' was introduced by srinivasan _<n> et al . we prove that the concavity of the fiber bundle over @xmath0 is determined by its  nicely fibered '' condition , that is , by the convexity of its induced contact form .<n> we also give an example of a contact form which is not induced by a fiber bundle , but which nevertheless has the same concavities as the induced contact forms . <n> the notion of fiber bundle was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in order to describe the structure of the bundle over the unit circle in a two - dimensional fiber . in the original definition the fiber was defined as the geodesic distance between two points on the plane , and it was assumed that the two points were invariant under the action of the unitary group , so that the bundle could be considered to be in one - to - one correspondence with the boundary of the circle . however , in practice the boundary is usually not invariant and it is not clear how to define a suitable fiber bundle condition . for instance , it is well - known that the fiber is invariant if and only if it can be framed so that each coordinate system on the fiber realizes the desired framing . on the other hand ,<n> it we construct symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with surgery on either the unknot or the hopf link , fibered with convex and concave boundary conditions .<n> we also show that such manifolds can be realized as the concave boundary of a symplectics . <n> unknots and links are the subject of intense study due to their connection to the theory of closed manifolds @xcite . in this paper<n> , we construct a new class of closed manifold with surgery conditions , which we call _ unknotting manifolds_. these manifolds are the generalization of the well - known unknot and hopf manifolds , and they are obtained by attaching a single  convex - to - concave '' handle along an unknot ( or link ) . as in the case of the standard unknot ,<n> the surgery conditions are specified by the boundary conditions on the fibers , while the boundary condition on the link is given by the standard contact form on the manifold . here<n> we will show how to realize surgeries on any number of different kinds of knots and links , including the standard hopf links as well as the confocal unknot with surgery , the convex unknot as a confocal @x we construct symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with two types of boundary conditions : surgery on the unknot and hopf link , and contact vector field on the boundary .<n> the surgery conditions are : ( 1 ) the standard unknot , ( 2 ) a gradient - like symplectomorphism on a disk and a compact surface . in the standard case<n> , we construct a pair of  convex - to - concave '' handles and show that they are attached to the boundary of a symplectically flat symplectics manifold with concave boundary , which we call a  symplectonic hopf manifold '' . as an application<n> we show that the standard surgery condition is preserved under a natural class of deformations . <n> the study of closed manifolds has a long history , going back to the work of hopf @xcite and others . the most common type of closed manifold that is invariant under boundary deformations is the _ knot _ , i.e. , a closed manifold with boundary that is not conformally invariant . for example , there are closed manifolds with boundary conditions that are _ not _ conformal invariance  weinstein s  convex - to - concave '' @xmath0-handles are constructed as subsets of the symplectic form of a symplectically invariant surface @xcite .<n> they can be attached along any legendrian knot with induced negative contact structure on the induced contact structure of a convex symplectics @x . in this paper , we show how to construct  more general '' convex -to - concave  concave - weyl - weierstrass '' manifolds , as well as  generalized '' weyl weyl manifolds . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] _ introduction. _<n> the purpose of this paper is to show how one can construct , from a given legendrian knots and surfaces ,  new '' manifolds or surfaces with certain properties , and , in the process , obtain , among other things , a new version of the thurston - bennequin theorem . for simplicity , consider a legendrian , unknotted , symplectologically invariant manifold , @x math0 , with induced contact , induced contact form and induced morse function @x<n> . then consider weinstein s  convex - to - convex '' @xmath0-handles are constructed as subsets of symplectic manifolds @xcite with _ concave _ boundary . in this paper , we show how to extend these techniques to create concave symplectically @x _ connected _ manifolds .<n> in particular , this allows us to construct a new class of examples of legendrian knots and links which bound _<n> concave_-@xmath1-manifolds . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] <n> the goal of this paper is to give an overview of the techniques used to construct convex - , concave - and fibration - like structures on the knot and link group , and to show how these techniques can be extended to construct new families of convex and concave structures . to do this ,<n> we first review the constructions of convex - and - convex manifolds and links and then we describe some new techniques for constructing symplectomorphisms from legendrian and legendrian knot / link groups . for completeness , here is a brief summary of the main results : [ cols=\",\",options=\"header \" , ] the we construct new examples of convex symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which are legendrian with respect to the induced negative contact structure on the singular fibers .<n> these manifolds are obtained by attaching symplectomorphisms to legendrian knots and fibers in a similar way as in the construction of @xcite . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] <n> _ introduction _ the study and construction of closed symplectically invariant manifolds has a long history , going back to the work of thurston and bennequin on symplecty invariants of genus zero and one . in their seminal monograph<n> , they constructed a new class of examples of closed , self - similar , genus zero , compactly supported , symplectimetric @x _ manifolds _ , and showed that they were _ not _ invariant under the _ affine _ or _ anisotropic _ holonomy . since that time , various techniques have been developed to construct convex symp - eulerian manifolds in this context , starting with the famous construction of skorokhod and bar - natan ( see e.g. refs .",

field driven inflation @xcite , primordial black - hole and pulsar accelerations , type ia and type ii supernovae , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe . in the past decade<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in the possibility that these gravitational waves may have a physical origin , e.g. , dark matter ( dm ) or dark energy ( de ) in the form of a supersymmetric ( susy ) black hole @xmath0 , a fermionic or bosonic scalar field , or a combination of the two . to search for these sources<n> is one of the main goals of the current generation of gravitational wave detectors , including the lisa , ligo , virgo  we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation , which is a brief period of thermal inflation caused by a scalar field .<n> we consider two cases : 1 . a period of inflation is caused by the scalar field @xmath0 , and 2 . after the phase transition ,<n> the field decays instantaneously into dark radiation @xcite . in the case 1<n> , the gw spectrum is known to be strongly suppressed due to the anisotropic stress caused by dark radiation . here , we show that the suppression is much weaker and the result is almost the same as the case of the thermal inflation . for the case 2 , on the other hand , there is a dip in the spectrum around the frequency of the sachs -

handed neutrino , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism , does not thermalize because of the weakness of the interaction of the majoron sector . next , a susy majoron model is considered .<n> this u(1 ) symmetry breaking may be identified as a gauged @xmath0 symmetry , or it can be global lepton number symmetry . then a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson appears which is associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the u(1)-symmetry . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we have assumed that the cosmological evolution goes as follows : ( i ) after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of the baryons and antibaryons quickly decays into the smajoron sector particles , ( ii ) the coherent oscillation of these particles dominates the universe after the temperature decreases to zero , and ( iii ) this dilutes about one - half of the dark radiation . here<n> we take the following parameters we study the spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> in particular , we calculate the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath0 of the amplitudes of gw perturbations in the md and rd eras . in the rd era ,<n> the gw amplitudes are proportional to the amplitude of the primordial perturbations , and hence the spectrum has a non - trivial dependence on the scale factor at which the mode enters the horizon . as a result , in the inflationary era the spectrum is non - perturbative . for the md era<n> , the spectrum can be non - oscillatory , while in the inflation era it can be oscillatory with a high frequency , which is within the reach of future space - based gw detectors . <n> inflation is one of the simplest and most promising candidates for explaining the origin of the energy density of the universe . at present , though , it is not the only option @xcite . among the many other possibilities , there is a class of models which predict the existence of a phase transition between a radiation - dominated and an inflationary - dominated universe , known as the quintessence phase transition ( pq  if the universe is filled with perfect fluid at the present epoch , gravitational waves ( gws ) of different wavenumbers exit the horizon at different epochs .<n> we show that the effective energy density of inflationary , subhorizon , dispersive , long - wavelength modes is proportional to the hubble parameter at the time of horizon exit , which implies that the present gw spectrum is almost flat . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) ,<n> if the equation of state is @xmath0 , the present value of the effective gw energy density is equal to that at the planck scale , and the wavenumber of the first gw to enter the horizon @xcite . <n> the observation of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by wmap and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite provide strong evidence for the existence of a non - vanishing cosmological term in the form of an effective gravitational constant . if the cosmological term originates from the vacuum energy of a phase transition in the early universe ( @x we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from thermal inflation , and show that the gw spectrum has oscillatory features at intermediate frequencies , which is not seen in conventional models .<n> we argue that the oscillatory feature originates from the  horizon entry '' process of the modes with wavenumber @xmath0 at the phase transition , where the vacuum energy immediately goes to radiation . in the short - wavelength limit<n> , the _ spectral index _ of the graviton depends on the ratio of the energy density of vacuum energy to that of matter in the universe at the epoch of thermal inflation ( or at the transition to the radiation - dominated era ) . as a result , in the intermediate frequency region , it is given by the value of the spectral index of gravitons , i.e. , we have the sachs - wolfe effect ( swe ) @xcite . <n> recently , there has been a lot of interest in gw phenomena from quantum gravity ( qg ) point of view , as well as from a theoretical viewpoint . from the qg viewpoint , one of the most interesting phenomena is _ gravitational wave we study the effect of gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation on the phase transition of the universe from a decelerating phase to a accelerating phase .<n> we show that the gw spectrum has two peaks , one at the transition and the other at the exit of the horizon , which are separated by @xmath0 at the critical point , where the universe begins to inflate . as a result<n> , the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations is significantly enhanced , and the ratio of the amplitudes of the two gw peaks is larger than unity . <n> inflation is one of the most fundamental phenomena in modern cosmology . during inflation ,<n> the energy density in the universe increases exponentially , resulting in the formation of large scale structure @xcite . at the same time , in the early stage of inflation ( called the inflationary epoch ) , a phase transition occurs , during which the universe starts to inflate and collapse . in this phase transition , radiation from the innermost region of the expanding universe<n> is accelerated by the gravitational field of the ambient medium , leading to the accelerated expansion of the early universe , called the cosmological constant ( cc)@xmath1 era . we study the effect of the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 on the dynamics of compact halos in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with extra dimensions .<n> we show that the effect on the eos can be quite different from that on the dark matter ( dm ) or dark energy ( ed ) . in the case of the dm eos<n> , we find that the energy density of the halo with respect to the galactic center ( gc ) can be significantly enhanced due to the effect , while that of the sm is negligible . on the other hand , for the ed case , the effect depends on the energy scale of the model , which can be larger than the halo energy density in order to suppress the effects of dm and sm . <n> the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) strongly suggest that the present universe is spatially flat and that there is an accelerating expansion ( see @xcite and the references therein for reviews ) we study the effect of the cp violating phase @xmath0 in the lepton sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we show that the relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in this scenario is strongly dependent on the cp phase , which is sensitive to the value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the lsp in the early universe . as a result ,<n> the lsp relic abundance can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the canonical value , provided that the parameter of the supersymmetry breaking ( susy ) breaking ( smb ) scale is sufficiently high . <n> the discovery of the baryon asymmetry of the universe by the planck collaboration @xcite has been one of the most important progresses in particle physics in the last two decades . in the framework of the smb model , it is well known that the lightest neutralino ( lh ) is the sneutrino which decays into a pair of the lhs , and its decay products are copiously observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) as well as in the production of the dark matter we point out that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale and the dark matter ( dm ) relic density .<n> we show that , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the relic dm density is proportional to the square of the corresponding supersymmetry breaking scale . as a result ,<n> the relic density of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can be much higher than the present upper limit of the dm relic density from the direct detection experiments if the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale is of the order of the planck scale or higher . <n> the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will provide a crucial test of the sm and its extensions . in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) the lightest neutralino ( lc ) plays the role of a dm particle , which decays into dm and sm leptons and quarks @xcite . however , due to the absence of a sm dark matter , there is no possibility of directly identifying the lc",

transformation based bandwidth estimators , based on univariate cross - validation , are not suitable for this purpose . instead , it is suggested to use a  modified ' version of one of the main competitors , namely , the  mirror reflection ' estimator , which is shown to be both more stable numerically and more efficient than its competitors . <n> monte carlo simulations are used to compare the performance of the proposed estimators with those of the other main competitors in the fixed - bandwidth regime . in recent years<n> , there has been increasing interest in the problem , particularly in the context of quantum information processing , where the amount of information encoded in a qubit is of crucial importance . to this end ,<n> a number of methods have been proposed for the estimation of copulas @xcite . among the most promising<n> are the so - called  copula - based ' ( cb ) estimators based on the covariance structure of the underlying density @xmath0 , and the probit transformation based estimators of the in this paper , we consider the estimation of copula density functions in the presence of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .<n> we introduce a new class of estimators , which we call @xmath0-copula density estimators ( ccade ) and which we show to be superior to state - of - the - art copula estimators such as the bernstein - copula - density estimator , the mirror reflection estimator and the penalised b - splines estimator in terms of the mean integrated squared error ( mise ) relative to the true estimator . in order to evaluate the performance of these ccades ,<n> we perform a simulation study and compare them with the above mentioned estimators for a wide range of sample sizes and copulas . <n> * keywords : * copula ; denoising ; error estimation ; semidefinite programming ( sdp ) * ams subject classifications :* 62g05 , 62g07 , 65c30 , 68u20 , 94a17 the problem of estimating copula densities has received a lot of attention in the last few years , mainly due to the increasing interest in awg this paper is concerned with estimating the copula density of a data set . in particular ,<n> the well - known  loss - alae ' dataset is considered , and the local log - quadratic estimator @xmath0 is compared with its competitors , namely the b - splines and mirror reflection estimators , as well as the bernstein estimator .<n> the results are encouraging , especially in presence of high tail dependence , such as for clayton and gumbel copulas with high kendall s . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the first part of the paper , the aim is to compare the performance of some probit - transformation estimators against their competitors in the framework of the usual parametric copula models , i.e. the independence copula and other very flat copula densities such as gaussian or frank with low dependence . for completeness<n> , we also consider a real data set ( indemnity payment and allocated loss adjustment expense associated to an insurance company ) , that has become a classic dataset in copula analysis , in particular in reporting the indemnity payment , reporting the adjustment expense , among other things . in this paper , a new class of estimators for the copula density of a multivariate normal model is proposed .<n> it is based on an improved probit - transformation estimator suggested in @xcite and is , in particular , fully nonparametric in the sense that it does not require the data to be drawn from a prior distribution , nor does it depend on any prior assumption on the underlying copula . <n> the estimator is shown to be consistent in the presence of unbounded copulas , as well as in situations where other estimators fail . in the univariate case<n> , it is seen to be equivalent to the well - known gumbel model , while in the multivariate case it gives a much better fit to the data than the gumbel estimator , which is based only on the data . as a consequence ,<n> the proposed estimator has a much wider range of applicability than its univariate counterpart , and can be considered as a new , powerful tool for nonparametric modelling of multivariate normal models . *<n> ams subject classification : * 62g05 , 62g07 , 65c30 , 68w20 , 94a17 , 90c26 , this paper introduces a new nonparametric density estimator for bivariate empirical copulas .<n> this estimator , based on the copula density estimator of @xcite , is shown to have several attractive properties . in particular , it is not affected by the _ curse of dimensionality _ and , as such , can be used in a wide variety of problems , including nonparametric estimation procedures , goodness - of - fit tests and nonparametric conditional density estimation . <n> copula , density , empirical process , nonparametric estimator . in this note , we show that the empirical copula process based on genuine observations is , in fact , a bivariate uniform empirical process on @xmath0 $ ] , where the coefficients in the first term are given by the classical kernel smoothing theory , and the second term is given by a modulus - of - continuity relation .<n> this is in contrast to the kolmogorov - smirnov - wolfenstein ( ksw ) bivariate empirical process , which is not a univariate uniform process . <n> empirical processes are used in a wide variety of contexts , ranging from the analysis of financial data @xcite , to the reconstruction of the distribution of oil prices in the wells of the national oil company of ukraine ( novosibirsk ) and the prediction of the temperature of the earth s atmosphere @x<n> . however , they are not used in statistics , as such , there is a lack of understanding as to how they can be used for statistical inference . in particular<n> , it is well known that , if one wants to estimate the mean and variance of a random variable based on empirical observations , one needs to know the we propose a new class of multivariate derivative estimators of the copula density .<n> the estimators are based on a two - step procedure , in which the first step is the estimation of the density of the underlying copula process and the second step is its derivative with respect to the first copula @xmath0 . in this paper , we show that the proposed estimators , when applied to real data , are asymptotically equivalent to the well - known bernstein density estimator . <n> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg , , in this paper , we propose a new method for estimating the multivariate copula process .<n> the proposed method is based on the probit transformation of the empirical copula , which is a nonparametric density estimation method . by using the proposed model , it is possible to estimate the nonparametric copula in a very simple way . <n> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg , , we propose a new method for estimating the nonparametric copula density of a multivariate regression model .<n> the method is based on the concept of the copula process , which is a nonparametric alternative to parametric models . in this paper<n> , we consider the estimation of copula densities of nonparametric regression models , where the regression model is modeled as a weighted least - squares process with a copula as a parameter . to estimate the density ,<n> the model is assumed to be copula - free , that is , it does not depend on the covariance matrices of the other model components . <n> the estimation problem of non - parametric density estimation is of interest in a wide range of areas , such as finance , public policy , social sciences , computer science , statistics , robotics , optimization , and bioinformatics @xcite . for a given nonparametric model @xmath0 , _<n> i.e. _ , the model with the least number of parameters , a _ nonparametric density estimator _ is defined as the estimator of the non parametric density of the model ; see , e.g. , genest et al . in this paper , we propose a nonparametric estimation method for copulas based on penalized likelihood .<n> the proposed method is based on the idea of sklar s semiparametric regression , where the regression coefficients are assumed to be smooth functions of the variable of interest , and the copula density is modeled as a weighted least - squares fit to the data . in order to apply the method to real data ,<n> we have to show that the proposed estimator converges to a true random model with probability @xmath0 . <n> _ keywords _ : semiparametric estimation , copula , penalized likelihood<n> .

lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological model , the standard equation of motion for the metric fluctuations can be recovered in the presence of inhomogeneous matter perturbations .<n> this is due to the fact that the perturbations of the flrw metric are described by the so -

time is flat @xcite . in recent years<n> , there has been a growing interest in the possibility that the present universe is not homogeneous and is dominated by a cosmological constant , as suggested by the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and the large - scale structure ( we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a bouncing phase of inflation .<n> we show that , in contrast to the standard inflationary scenario , the scale factor during the bounce has a non - trivial dependence on the wave number . in particular , for wave numbers in the range @xmath0 , where the effective potentials are of the order of unity , it is possible to set up physically well - motivated initial conditions , provided that the curvature is negligible . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 04.50.+h , 95.35.+d it has been known for a long time that the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion , and that the hubble constant is oscillating at the same rate as the angular frequency of the microwave background radiation . as a consequence ,<n> the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , which is defined as the ratio of the density of matter to that of radiation at the present epoch , is expected to increase exponentially with time , as @xcite has been repeatedly shown to be the case in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , see e.g. refs . and references therein.@xcite the we show that , contrary to common wisdom , a de sitter - like expansion of the universe can be preceded by a bounce .<n> the bounce is driven by the presence of a non - vanishing scalar field potential , and it occurs when the expansion is close to de sitter s limit . in this case , the de sitter solution is recovered as a limiting case of a bounce driven by a scalar field with a potential @xmath0 . <n> the recent discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite strongly suggests that our universe is currently undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion . at the same time , however , it is well - known that the dynamics of the early universe was dominated by inflation : the hubble constant was much larger than its present value , indicating that inflation is rapidly coming to an end . as a result ,<n> it is natural to ask what happens to the inflationary expansion when the universe enters the bounce regime , _<n> i.e. _ when the scalar field becomes non - zero . to answer this question<n> , one has to consider the following question : what is the nature of the non - inflationary expansion ?<n> we show that a bouncing universe with a de sitter - like bounce can be described in terms of an underlying particle physics model with a scalar field as matter content .<n> the effective potential for the scalar field is of the de sitter form , but with a nonvanishing amount of kinetic energy in it . in this model ,<n> the universe starts at either a maximum or a minimum of the potential , both around the time of the bounce , and the amplitude of scalar perturbations is controlled by the size of the universe at this time . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 11.27.+d , 04.50.+h 2 recently , there has been a growing interest in the possibility that the universe may have experienced a bouncing phase in its evolution @xcite . at the same time , it has been difficult to understand how such a scenario can be consistent with the standard inflationary paradigm , in which the universe undergoes a phase transition from a cold dark matter - like to a hot big bang - like state . to this end<n> , a number of models have been proposed , among them the simplest , the so - called de sitter model . among these , one of the we show that the bounce in the early universe can be described by the solution of the einstein equations sourced by a single , massless , homogeneous and isotropic scalar field .<n> the scalar field has a non - vanishing potential at the bounce and oscillates with a period of order the hubble time . after the bounce<n> , the universe enters a radiation - dominated era . in this scenario ,<n> the energy density in matter and radiation is dominated by the kinetic energy of the bounce . <n> the standard model of cosmology is based on the hypothesis that the universe was filled with matter about @xmath0 years after the big bang , at which time a phase transition took place , characterized by the so - called bounce , that is , a sudden decrease in the kinetic energies of the components of the universe @xcite . since then , there has been a lot of interest in the possibility of explaining the observed luminosity - temperature relation of the hot big bang by means of a scalar field model . among the many models that have been proposed , however , one of the most appealing is provided by the scenario of a single scalar field with a nonzero potential @x<n> . this scalar field could we present a class of bouncing cosmological models in which the curvature of the spacetime at the time of the bounce is proportional to the square of the curvature at the bounce time .<n> we model this curvature by means of a bardeen - type equation of state , and show that it can give rise to the standard hot big bang singularity without the need for an additional phase of inflation , provided the scale factor is sufficiently large after the bounce . in this case<n> , the curvature can be naturally related to the hubble parameter at the matching time , @xmath0 , which is the epoch of the transition from the radiation - dominated era to the curvature - dominated one . <n> the evolution of the universe after the big bang is one of the most important open problems of modern physics . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> the problem is very challenging , as it involves the generation of gravitational waves which , due to the non - linear nature of the problem , can not be described by the standard models @xcite . for this reason , in the last decade , much effort has been devoted to the study of inflationary models . among these , there are the so - called  standard '' we study the effect of anisotropies in a scalar field potential on the propagation of gravitational waves .<n> we show that , in the case of an isotropic potential , the spectrum of the fluctuations is modified by the presence of a bounce , and that the height of the central peak and the position of the wings of the perturbations are modified as well . <n> gravitational waves ( gws ) are waves that propagate through space at a constant velocity @xmath0 . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the gravitational field is proportional to the mass of the graviton @xcite . however , there are many theories that have been proposed in order to reconcile the sm with observations . among these<n> are theories that make use of gravitons as elementary particles , such as brans - dicke ( bd ) models , which have been extensively studied in the context of string theory , see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein . for these theories , a gw is a massive particle , with a mass and coupling constant that are proportional to its charge and mass squared , respectively . as a consequence , we study the interaction of a wave packet with a one - dimensional barrier .<n> the wave packet interacts with the barrier via a potential @xmath0 which depends on the mode and the barrier position . for a wave packets with energy @xxmath1 ,<n> the interaction is repulsive at the barrier and attractive at the side of the barrier where the mode is localized . in the limit of large barrier height<n> , the interaction can be either attractive or repulsive , depending on whether the mode interacts with an even or an odd number of peaks in the barrier , and whether it is localized in the center or in the wings . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + ++ + + /- this paper is a continuation of our previous paper @xcite , where we studied the wave interaction with a barrier in the presence of an external potential . here , we focus on the case when the barrier height is much larger than the wave length , _<n> i.e. _ , when the interaction takes place in the bulk of the system . as a result of the interaction with the potential , a mode may be localized in one of the peaks , or it may we show that a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type potential , interacting with a quantized magnetic field , can produce a non - zero net charge on the sample .<n> this is achieved by means of a nontrivial modification of the potential which gives rise to a net charge of the order of @xmath0 . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.-w , 03.30.+p , 05.45.mt the study of quantized conductance in semiconductor nanostructures has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite . in this context<n> , it is important to understand the relation between the quantization of conductance and the behavior of the system in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition . for this purpose ,<n> it is of interest to calculate the quantum conductance of a system which interacts with a potential of the type described by the bcs theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which is a generalization of the well - known chern - simons theory of qed to the case of interacting potentials . since the original formulation of the theory of the quantum hall effect , qed has been the subject of great interest we study the effect of an external magnetic field on a bose - einstein condensate in an optical trap .<n> we show that the interaction between the condensate and the magnetic field leads to the formation of a condensate - vortex pair in the trap , which can be used to control the dynamics of the condensate . <n> the interaction of a quantum system with a quantized field has been a topic of intense investigation since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . in quantum field theory<n> the field is described by a hilbert space spanned by @xmath0 states , and the interaction among these states is given by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian . for a system in one spatial dimension ( 1d )<n> , this interaction is well - known to be of the lieb - liniger type , with a coupling constant that vanishes in the long - wavelength limit . as a result ,<n> the spectrum of the system is well approximated by that of a one - dimensional bose gas in a 1d trap ; see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for a recent review . since then , the bdg we study the propagation of scalar and tensor perturbations in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background .<n> we show that , as one approaches a general relativistic bounce , the perturbation variables behave in a non - trivial way . in particular , they do not behave as canonically quantized , and diverge during the bounce . as a consequence ,<n> the curvature of the background space - time becomes non - negligible at the bounce and the effective velocity of sound diverges . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.-k , 04.50.+h , 95.36.+x one of the most important problems in cosmology today is the so - called @xmath0 problem , namely , what is the origin of the density perturbations ?<n> it is well - known that the equation of state ( eos ) of the early universe is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , but it is still not completely clear what the mechanism is for the formation of the baryons in the universe . according to the big bang theory , _<n> i.e. _ the vacuum energy of the universe is we propose a scenario in which the universe undergoes a transition from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated era through a sudden change in the scale factor .<n> the transition is driven by the gravitational wave potential , which is dominated by the vacuum energy associated with the transition , and is preceded by a phase of quasi - exponential inflation , followed by a period of radiation domination . in this scenario ,<n> the tensorial and scalar modes of perturbations are affected by the transition but are not affected by it , regardless of the underlying parameter values . within the framework of our bouncing solution<n> , the radiation - to - matter transition can be studied in detail , showing that it is a singular limiting case . <n> the standard cosmological scenario ( without a cosmological constant ) leads to a radiation dominated universe at late times ( @xmath0 ) , after which the expansion of the universe slows down and eventually stops @xcite . at the same time , there is a transition to matter dominated universes , _<n> i.e. _ , a universe with zero spatial curvature , occurring at later times ( _ e.g.<n> _ at the present epoch ) @ we study the evolution of scalar gravitational perturbations in the closed spatial section of a de sitter - like bouncing solution of einstein s equations .<n> we show that this bouncing solution can serve as a  laboratory '' for the study of non - linear field theory in curved space - times . in this context , we find that the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations at the bounce , whereas the potential is the quantity that matters , in contrast to what happens in the pre big bang case . <n> gravitational waves are a powerful probe of the early universe , being sensitive probes of both the physical conditions at the time of their production and the structure of the universe at that time . as a consequence ,<n> they have been used to test various models of early universe physics , such as inflation @xcite , brane - world models of structure formation , and models of phase transitions , among others . at the same time , they have also been studied in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) , with the aim of understanding the role played by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a field in the formation and evolution of structure  we discuss the evolution of gravitational wave perturbations in bouncing models of the universe , and show that the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation is the need for a high curvature phase , which may drastically modify the physical predictions . <n> there has been much recent interest in the problem of cosmological perturbations of the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum @xcite . in the context of inflation ,<n> the most natural way to deal with this problem is to postulate that the universe is bouncing , _<n> i.e. _ that it is expanding at a constant rate .<n> however , there is no reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce . on the other hand , in string - motivated models of gravity , such as the one proposed by melnikov and sahni , @xmath0 , where the gw spectrum is not affected by the bounce , it is possible to avoid this problem by assuming that there is a non - vanishing curvature in the pre - bounce phase . here<n> we will show that this is not the case , by explicitly constructing a bouncing model in which the curvature is vanishingly small during the bounce and then expanding at we present a general formalism for the study of the dynamics of black holes in string theory .<n> the formalism is based on the definition of black hole horizon as a black hole with horizon length @xmath0 times the string tension , and on the assumption that black holes are in one - to - one correspondence with the classical trajectories of classical trajectories . as a consequence ,<n> black hole dynamics can be studied in the same way as classical trajectories are studied , i.e. , with the same formalism , but using different equations of motion . in this paper<n> , we study a particular example of a two - dimensional space - time , in which black hole trajectories are known to be asymptotically flat , _<n> i. e. _ , they do not experience any instabilities . <n> black holes ( bhs ) are one of the most interesting topics in theoretical physics , as they are the source of a lot of tension in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite . since the discovery of the first bhs by co -

[ fig : nadh ] ) . in lung disease ,<n> mi leads to the formation of the lung surface fad ( fad ) signal , which is the primary marker of lung activity and plays an important role in the pulsation process , as well as in the determination of lung function , in spite of the fact that the fad signal is not sensitive in this study , we investigated the effect of rotenone , kcn , pcp , and kcn + kcn on fad and nadh signals in hyperoxic lungs .<n> we found that the addition of kcn to pcp - treated normoxic lungs increased nadh , but did not change the fad signal significantly . on the other hand , the fad and<n> nadh signal decreased with the kcn addition . in addition , there was no significant difference in the qualitative and quantitative effects of the various kcns and pcp on fad signal . <n> [ [ section ] ] one of the most challenging problems in pulmonary fibrosis is the treatment of non -

like structures on the surface of bacteria . as a result of biofilm formation , bacteria<n> are able to accumulate in the lung tissue and cause various diseases , including pulsational and a bacterial infection in lungs and the biofilms themselves @x we report on the utility of optical fluorescent imaging for evaluating the effect of subacute rat exposure to hyperoxic lung activity .<n> rat pulsation was followed by optical fluorescence imaging in the @xmath0 fluorescent band , which was used to measure complex i and ii activities in the p2 fractions obtained from rat lung homogenates . for comparison , normoxic and<n> hypermoxic lungs were observed to have the same p2 fraction after accounting for normal attenuation , attenuation factor , and normal attenuation ratio effects , respectively . <n> subacute exposure to lung activity in rats is known to increase the risk for ectopic , non  bacterial infections such as staphylococcus aureus ( s.ao ) @xcite , but the mechanism for this is not well understood . in this study<n> , we compared the optical fluorescence activities measured from rat lungs with those measured from lung homogens , i.e. , rats that were exposed to less than twice the average value of 50 ng / s for one year . we found that the fraction of optical fluorescence activity that decreased significantly with increasing exposure was more significant for hyperoxics than for normoxics , suggesting that we report the results of a non - destructive hyperoxia - induced change in the complex i and ii redox state of rat lung tissue .<n> the results demonstrate the ability of this approach to detect a change in mitochondrial redox state in the early phase of hyperoxic lung injury , when the histology is not different from that of normoxic rats . <n> hyperoxiysis is the common cause of morbidity and mortality in rats with chronic illness @xcite . in spite of its ubiquity ,<n> the mechanism of hyperoxial injury is not well understood , although it has been suggested that it may contribute to the development of a number of complex diseases such as hiv , post - hiv cirrhosis , and endoplasmic reticulum ( erg ) damage @xmath0 , to name a few<n> . however , it has also been shown that hyperoxiies may lead to damage to the vasculature , which leads to an increased risk of endocardial injury @x . as a result , there has been an increasing interest in understanding the mechanisms of damage to lung tissue by hyperoxis , in particular in the context of hiv and endocarditis @ we report a study of the effects of exposure to ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) on the activities of the krebs cycle enzymes , succinate dehydrogenase , isocitrate dehydrogenase and complex i redox state .<n> we find that the measured hyperoxia -

induced activity , in particular in terms of its relation to the activity of enzymes involved in the cr cycle , such as alanine interphosphatephosphate ( aconitase ) , alanine monophosphate ( amsb ) and alanine triphosphate ( atp ) @xmath0 , to name a few . despite this interest , the effect of cr exposure on the there is a growing body of evidence that enzyme - mediated signaling may be involved in some forms of lung disease , including chronic lung infection , non - bacterial pneumonia ( nbp ) , and bacterial endocarditis ( beva ) @xcite .<n> recently , the krebs cycle has been shown to be associated with an increase in lactate to pyruvate ratio and an apparent decrease in nadh signal in the presence of pcp . in this study<n> , we report that pcp may contribute to the measured change in complex i redox state in hyperoxic lung , in contrast to normoxic lung as a measure of the coupling between respiration and phosphorylation . <n> counterintuitively , pcp does not affect the change in mitochondria matrix as measured by the increase in mitochondria to lactate ratio , but does increase cytosolic nadh production in the mitochondria matrix via the malate - aspartate shuttle . as a result ,<n> the pcp - induced decrease in mitochondria - matrix - sensitive nadh activity in lung is not sufficient to account for the observed decrease in the complex i activity in the absence of hyperoxia , suggesting that lung infection may be an important contributor to the non -

mills theories .<n> we show that the calabi - yau space is closely related to the quantum modified chiral ring , and we correlate this geometry obstruction to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most important ideas of modern physics . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , supersymmetry<n> is realized by the gauge group and the higgs field , both of which are coupled to their corresponding higgs bosons : the @xmath0 superpartners of the ordinary fermions . for a gauge theory in which supersymmetry is broken ,<n> the gauge symmetry must be broken in a non - perturbative way , such that there is a vacuum expectation value for the fermionic higgs fields . as a result<n> , the vacuum is not supersymmetric , but it is well understood that supersymmetry can be broken by spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , which occurs when the supersymmetry - breaking higgs coupling is large enough : for example , in gauge theories with spontaneously broken supersymmetry , gauginos we study the konishi anomaly and supersymmetry breaking in a four - node quiver theory with @xmath0 symmetry .<n> the theory has a baryonic branch and a quantum -

mills ( scm ) theory , which is a generalization of the well - known su(n ) gauge theory .<n> we show that this theory is a supersymmetric ( susy ) , chiral gauge theory ( cgt ) in the sense that it is a gauge theory in the same sense as the usual susy gauge theories , but it has susy breaking terms . in particular , the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at the susy phase transition point . <n> we also study the chiral ring for this theory and show that it has the same structure as the gauge ring for the standard model ( sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) with the addition of a singlet and two higgs doublet fields . as a consequence ,<n> the sm gauge theory has only one higgs field , while the sm and the sm have three higgs fields in addition to the usual gauge fields , and the theory is supersymmetric in the sm , as well as in the non -

q)r_u . such a loop naturally transforms in a cubic representation of the theory , leading to expected relations of the form : r_a = ( p , p  in this paper , we introduce a new class of holomorphic functions on the cone over @xmath0 , which we call _ chiral _ functions .<n> we show that these functions are periodic under shifts on the singularities of the cone . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a continuation of our paper @xcite , where we introduced a class of  chiral '' functions and showed how to compute them . here ,<n> we extend this class of functions to the case of a cone over a finite field . in this case<n> , it is well known that chiral functions are holomorphic , that is , they satisfy the laplace equation , but they do not have periodic undershifts on their singularities . as an application of this theory , here<n> we consider the case where the field is a finitely generated cone over the field , and show that there are _ non - periodic _ <n> chiral functions on this cone that are not holomorphic and do not satisfy the lebesgue - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) equation . for this case , the lgw equation is known to be singular at the singular we comment on the recent work of j. p. gauntlett and j. sparks @xcite on the duality cascades and the chisb - resolution of naked singularities in ads / cft .<n> we also comment on a recent work by r. kachru , s. kallosh , r. linde , and m. r. plesser on the superconformal field theory at the calabi - yau singularity . <n> [ [ section ] ] recently , there has been a lot of interest in the correspondence between gauge theory and geometry . in particular , it has been shown by a number of authors that the supergravity duals of a certain class of gauge theories , the so - called d - branes , can be obtained from a certain type of holomorphic functions on the space of riemannian metric functions @xmath0 , which are holomorphic in the cft but not in the gauge theory . as an application of this correspondence<n> , one can construct a family of supersymmetric cfts with sasaki - einstein metrics on the three - sphere . for a particular choice of the superpotential ,<n> the we show that the @xmath0 superconformal gauge theory can be dual to a super yang - mills theory with a gauge symmetry that is broken by the gauge field .<n> the dual gauge theory possesses a gauge invariant anomaly - free sector , which we call  anomaly@xmath1 ' , and a gauge bosonic sector . in this note<n> , we consider the possibility of dualizing gauge theories with gauge symmetries that are broken by gauge fields that are invariant under the action of the super yang <n> mills theory ( sgw ) , i.e. , the gauge symmetry of the theory is not broken . <n> this note is a short summary of a joint work with c. p. herzog and i. r. klebanov @xcite , hereafter denoted as  hep -

stieltjes functional with respect to a random field configuration .<n> it represents the laplace counterpart of the characteristic functional of the random field , both of which are often used in particle physics , turbulence theory , and structure formation theories in the universe , etc.(e.g. * ? ?<n> * ) here we derive the probability density function ( pdf ) of the overall configuration , @xmath0$ ] , which is the assigned probability functional for an overall configuration of the field . as an example<n> , we apply our formalism to the case of a scalar field with an isotropic equation of state . <n> pacs numbers : 05.30.-d , 05.40.-a , 02.50.-r in statistical mechanics , the expectation value of a physical quantity is defined by its expectation value in the configuration space of a system under investigation . for a classical system ,<n> this quantity is given by the correlation function of the system of interest . in quantum mechanics<n> it is usually expressed in terms of the expectation values of observables , such as the mean value and the variance . however , we present a new method for the analysis of time - resolved intensity fluctuations in synchrotron radiation .<n> the method is based on the concept of a point field , which can be expanded in terms of a probability generating functional ( pgfl ) , and on the observation of the fluctuation field blurred by a beam profile . as an example<n> , we apply this method to the esi beamline at the stanford linear accelerator center . <n> the study of intensity fluctuations ( i.e. , intensity fluctuations @xcite ) is one of the most important areas of astrophysical research . in recent years , a great effort has been devoted to the development of techniques to measure the intensity fluctuations of high -

known that the observed number counts of astronomical sources are affected by statistical noise , such as gaussian noise and confusion noise @xcite . in particular , the source counts are strongly affected by the eddington bias , i.e. , by the fact that the noise causes the observed counts to be biased upward . for a source with a flux larger than a certain threshold ,<n> the number count is very sensitive to the uncertainty of the source , and the correction can be very large . on the other hand , for a flux smaller than that of the correction , there is a small window in which the correction is negligibly small , so that the correction does not affect the source count significantly . when the source flux is we propose a method to determine the beam size from the fluctuation power spectrum ( pdf ) .<n> the method is applied to subaru suprime - cam ( ssc ) data , which is the largest data set currently available . in order to obtain the best signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio ,<n> we need to minimize the noise in the beam . to this end<n> , we first derive the noise power spectrum , and then derive the confusion limit , i.e. , the upper limit of the noise intensity , based on the fluctuation pdf . <n> the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cgro _ ) is a wide -

frequency surveys of point sources .<n> we show that the standard formulae for the confusion limit of unclustered sources can be derived in two ways : one using the exponent of differential number counts @xmath0 , and the other using the empirical rule of thumb @xcite . in the latter case<n> , we also derive an expression for the cutoff signal , which is independent of the number of frequency bands , as well as a formula for the maximum number of sources that can be processed in a single run of the survey . <n> [ [ section ] ] the basic goal of this paper is to study the question of confusion limits for point - source detection in multifrequency surveys . to answer this question ,<n> we consider two basic types of number - count distributions : number counts that are described by a power - law , or differential number count distributions that are given by a log - normal distribution . for both types of distributions , <n> we derive formulas for the limit flux to a cutoff signal as a function of the confusion parameters , namely , the spectral index of the source and the confusion parameter of the beam pattern , for both the uncluster in this paper , we study the beam -

sections of the reactions , which are of great importance for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as well as the hadron collider ( hc ) experiments @xcite . in the last decade , a great deal of work has been done in this field , both theoretically and experimentally , with the aim of developing a complete picture of the number - counting we study the source confusion limits for galaxies in the _ iras _ @xmath0 m survey , and compare them with the predictions of the hierarchical clustering model .<n> we find that the confusion limits of infrared galaxies are much smaller than those of submillimeter galaxies , which is in agreement with the results of @xcite . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxy : statistics galaxies : distances and redshifts <n> cosmology : theory large -

related quantities of the _ iras _ faint galaxy survey ( fgls ) at @xmath0 , based on the statistical properties of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution .<n> first , we show that the statistic of the confusion limit , which is defined as the difference between the number of detected galaxies and that of unresolvable sources , is well approximated by a power - law number count model with the index of the model , 2.5 , and depends on the detected flux only through the flux - dependent clustering , i.e. , the  fiducial ' flux . in order to evaluate the average clustering strength of the fgl galaxy sample ,<n> we calculate the correlation function of the galaxy distribution based on monte - carlo simulations . as a result<n> , it is found that the correlation structure strongly affects the statistics of the counts of confused galaxies , such as the lcc index , l@xmath1 , etc . <n> second , by applying the same model to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) galaxy sample with the same deep surveys by _ iso _ revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy number counts .<n> the observed number counts of infrared galaxies show a rapid increase in number count level , with cumulative slope @xmath0 much steeper than that of unclustered sources @xcite . in order to understand the origin of the extremely steep number - count slope , it is necessary to consider the effect of clustering , which can be very severe if the number counts are described by a power - law function . here<n> we present a model of the spatial two - point correlation function of galaxies , and show that the clustering makes the confusion limit much shallower than the unclustering case , even though the rms of the confusion noise is large . based on this model , we obtained the confusion limits of 1.8 mjy and 2.0 mjy for the 90@xmath1 m and 170@x.1 m _<n> iso_-detected sources , respectively . <n> [ [ section ] ] the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_@xcite ( hereafter referred to as _ _ i _ for short ) is a new , powerful , ground -

redshift starburst galaxies . our analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated cosmological models , hence the confusion problem should be properly considered for future airborne or space submillimeter observational projects such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture submillimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory_. the measured confusion limit from scuba survey data was found to be shallower than that expected from classical formula ( d. h. hughes 2003  we present a new method for the analysis of the submillimeter galaxy number counts and fluctuations .<n> we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we calculated the confusion limits from the power - law number counts , and from the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity . at infrared wavelengths ,<n> the clustering effect becomes very severe , so that we estimated the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model of hughes , enoki , taihei yano , seiji ueda , takuji tsujimoto , naoteru gouda , yasmin friedmann , hiroshi shibai , & hiroyuki hirashita . <n> we also applied our method to future submillimeter large surveys , such as _ astro -

called _ summary statistics_. in this paper , we present a general method to derive the cumulants of the summary statistics for any stochastic process , and we apply it to the case of a stochastic process with a non - markovian dynamics , namely , clustered source dynamics . as a result ,<n> we show that the cumulant of the second order of the gaussian summary statistics is equal to that of the first - order one , if the variance of the fluctuating field is not too large . in this paper , we derive the entanglement spectrum of a quantum dot coupled to a bosonic bath .<n> we show that the entanglement of the quantum dot and the bath can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the bath s interaction with the dot . as a result ,<n> the entanglement can be made arbitrarily large and long . <n> quantum dot ( qd ) systems have been studied extensively due to their potential application as qubits in quantum computing @xcite . in particular , the entanglement between the qd system and a bath is of great interest because it can be used to determine the state of the system , as well as its entanglement with the environment . to this end<n> , it has been shown that a qd quantum computer can be simulated by a classical two - level system with a weak coupling between the two levels , e.g. , by a resonant level drive in a semiconductor double - quantum dot system ( sdt ) . for a given bath strength @xmath0 , a qubit can be prepared in the steady state by applying a sinusoidal force to the sr , p , and t level of the double -

law index of the angular correlation function of galaxies , @xmath0 , while that for the angular separation between objects is a logarithmic function of their position , with a coefficient that is a decreasing function of the distance between the sources . we also show that for a gaussian beam pattern , the correlation lengths of the sources and angular separations are proportional to each other , as expected , but with a different exponent . <n> optical sources are used in astronomy for the detection of faint astronomical objects such as stars and galaxies . in order to detect them ,<n> it is important to understand their properties such as number counts , correlation lengths , and two - point correlation functions ( lts ) @xcite<n> . however , it is not always possible to determine these properties directly from the number counts of an optical source . instead , one would like to understand the properties of the spatial distribution of its sources , which is a more difficult task  we present a new algorithm for the detection of point sources in a beam .<n> the algorithm is based on the use of the laplace - stieltjes approximation to the probability distribution function of the number of sources in the beam , which is obtained by taking into account the distribution of the flux density of the point sources . as an example<n> , we apply the algorithm to the analysis of the lsnd dataset . <n> the main goal of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is to measure the number density of galactic and extragalactic point sources on the sky . in order to achieve this goal ,<n> a central part of the survey area has to be covered by narrowband filters , such as the narrowband ccd ( n@xmath0 ) or ccd - n ( @xmath1 ) . for a complete knowledge of the sky distribution , it is important to have a good understanding of the statistical properties of the sources , in particular their number density , their number variance , etc . to achieve the goal of a complete sky coverage , a beam with a narrowband filter<n> is usually placed in front of the central ccd we present a new method for the identification of classical and quantum sources in a beam - dump ccd interferometer .<n> the method is based on the expansion of the correlation function of the interferometric signal in terms of the position of the beam dump , the intensity of the field produced by the beam , and the number of sources in each beam . using this method , we were able to identify more than @xmath0 classical sources in the first year of operation of the s@xmath1 ccd spectrometer at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) . in the second year of cso operation ,<n> we obtained a total of more than 20 classical and 10 quantum sources . <n> the cso is a high -

up photometry reveals that the system is actually composed of two red dwarfs , which we have confirmed spectroscopically from _ hst _<n> wfpc2 photometry . <n> we have measured a trigonometric parallax for the pair of stars , and find that the projected separation between the two stars is @x.1 pc , making this the most distant binary system known to date with a spectroscopically confirmed spectroscopic binary companion . at the distance of the system ,<n> the primary star has a mass of 0.45 m@xcite and a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-0.24 dex , while the secondary is only a few tenths of a magnitude fainter , with a mass and metallicity similar to that of a zams star at the same spectral type and luminosity . we use _ hipparcos _ and @xmath0 photometry to search for subdwarfs in close binary systems near the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence .<n> we identify 20 secondaries that lie 0.42 mag above the standard main sequence , and an additional 11 pairs that lie between the main sequences and the white dwarf sequence ; nine of these secondaries are found to be foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with background stars , while the remaining 11 secondaries may be foreground white dwarfs , chance pairs of stars with the same color and absolute magnitude , or unresolved double stars . among the secondaries , we find one pair with a transverse velocity of only 0.11 mag , suggesting that this star is a metal - poor red subd warf . <n> binaries : close stars : dwarfs white dwarf ( wd ) <n> white dwarf pairs : general the distribution of companions in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is a well - studied topic of stellar astrophysics . in the cmd of main sequence stars ( m@xmath1 ) @xcite ,<n> the red dwarf sequence ( rds ) dominates , followed by we report the results of a search for wide binary systems in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> our search yielded 347 candidate systems with angular separations @xmath0 mas yr@xmath1 , relative proper motions between the components between 8 and 25 mas yr @xcite , and with projected separations between 1 and 100 pc . of these ,<n> we find 10 systems with separations larger than 10 mas yr , which are most likely to be chance alignments , while the remainder are likely wide binaries . in the context of the standard halo model of structure formation<n> , these systems imply that halo subdwarfs make up a significant fraction of all halo stars . <n> the wide binary nature of the halo is a natural consequence of the merger history of the host galaxy , as well as the chemical composition of the components . for halo stars more massive than @x.2m0 , the mass of the progenitor star is expected to be in the range of @ x.2 - 1@xcite and to have metallicities between -0.2 and -0.1 dex . on the other hand , for more massive stars , metallicities are expected to decrease with increasing distance we report the results of a search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars using the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) .<n> we have identified 509 new wide binary systems , bringing the total number of known pairs to 783 . of these 783 pairs ,<n> 263 are newly reported here for the first time , as well as 148 that were listed in luyten s lds catalog but were not listed in the gc04 catalog . <n> the large area covered by our search ( @xmath0 ) and the high completeness of our catalog ( 98% ) allow us to identify virtually all known _ gc _ secondaries , down to an apparent magnitude of 18 , and to recover essentially all of the pairs listed in geronimo - clegg et al.s ( 2004 ) catalog , which has a much lower completeness . in total , we find that our survey recovers essentially all the pairs of gc 04 and adds a significant number of new objects . among the 783 new pairs reported here , 263 have at least one primary and/or secondary that are both listed in either the rnltt or we present a complete census of secondaries in galactic stellar systems with angular separations @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .<n> our sample is drawn from the limits of the lspm - north catalog , and is complete down to the limiting absolute magnitude of the catalog . for secondaries fainter than the magnitude limit , we use the _ hipparcos _ and 2mass catalogs to estimate the incompleteness of our census . we find that the secondaries are dominated by m dwarfs , with a median transverse velocity of 300 km s@xcite . <n> binaries : close stars : kinematics and dynamics open clusters and associations : general open clusters : individual : ngc 6946 open clusters we report the results of a search for hydrogen - burning secondaries in the solar neighborhood , using data from the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> we have determined that our northern - sky census was statistically complete for systems within 100 pc and proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , and for cpm companions with luminosities in the @xcite range . from our statistically complete sample of cpm pairs with _ primaries , we can now estimate the multiplicity fraction of wide binary systems in the sun . <n> the luminosity function of secondaries is a fundamental parameter in the study of the structure and evolution of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . in recent years<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the faint end of this luminosity function , in particular in secondaries of very low mass . to understand the formation mechanisms for secondaries , it is necessary to know the number of very - low mass secondaries that are likely to be found in the field , since the absolute magnitude of main - sequence stars is correlated with mass ; the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time . the we conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .<n> we find no evidence for cpm companions in this sample , and place an upper limit on the fraction of binaries containing a typical , nearby star as a companion . for binaries with projected separations<n> less than 10 au , we find that the frequency distribution can be described by a power law of the form @xcite . at larger separations ,<n> the distribution is consistent with _ pik s law_.<n> however , at separations greater than 10au , the observed distribution is not consistent with the model used in @cite , which predicts a distribution with a power - law index of 2 . we conclude that star formation processes initially yield a distribution of wide binaries / multiples which breaks down because of the disruptive effects of the environment in which these systems are born . <n> [ [ section ] ] one of the most important open questions in astrophysics is how the distribution of orbital separations of stellar systems is affected by the formation and evolution of stars in the vicinity of the sun . in particular , we present a large , statistically complete census of common proper motion ( cpm ) companions to _ hipparcos _ stars based on the large synoptic survey of the northern sky ( lspm - north ) .<n> this survey covers 20,000 square degrees and is complete to proper motion @xmath0 , with a completeness limit of @xcite . using this large sample of wide cpm pairs<n> , we find clear evidence for a break in _ pik s law _ at large angular separations , and that the frequency of wide binaries decreases with increasing orbital separation . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we present preliminary results from a survey of subdwarf pairs at @xmath0 .<n> the pairs are selected from the rosat all - sky survey using the standard candle method , and are selected to have either one or two detected components . in most cases the detected components are blueshifted low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . however , in a few cases there are clear detections of additional components , some of which are due to extragalactic sources . <n> the main aim of this survey is to search for additional lmxb components in order to see if there are any extra galaxies out there that are similar to the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) in the galactic halo , or if there is a correlation between the onc and the extended halo of the galaxy , as found in the liner ngc 6397 . at present , there are no known extra galaxies that can be associated with onc or with any extended halo in the milky way ( mw ) andromeda ( lmc ) as well as with any compact galaxy . for a complete list of lines of sight<n> see e.g. refs.@x we present optical and near - ir photometry of a sample of the brightest active galactic nuclei ( agns ) selected from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey .<n> the agn photometry is carried out with the 2df multi - object spectrograph on the 1.5 m telescope at apache point observatory , arizona , usa . in most cases the foreground agn are well resolved , but in a few cases the background subdwarfs are also detected . <n> the discovery of a large number of bright , nearby agn has been one of the most important developments in the field of extragalactic astronomy during the last few years , both from the observational and theoretical point of view . however , there are still many open questions about the nature of the sources , especially those associated with the galactic centre ( gc ) , which are responsible for a large fraction of the observed agn counts . to better understand the properties of agn , it is important to study agn from both a photometric and spectroscopic point of views , since agn tend to be more spatially extended than galactic nuclei , and are known to be associated with a larger mass . we present the results of a survey of extragalactic sub - millimetre sources using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at an angular resolution of @xmath0 .<n> the survey covers the following frequency ranges : _<n> i ) _ the galactic centre ( gc ) with declinations in the range -18 to -22 , and _ ii _ ) the red - giant branch ( rgb ) in declinations between -25 and -25 , with a median declination of -25.3 . <n> we have found that there are a large number of sources in all these frequency ranges that are brighter than , or very close to , the gc at the same angular resolution . in particular , there are many sources that are very bright , very red or very faint , as well as many that are fainter than gc but brighter than lrrrrrclrrrrrrr , i.e. , they have a lrrrrrlrrrrrrr - like structure . however , we have not found any evidence for any extended sources in any of the bands , except for a few very bright sources , some of which are very compact recent observations of very compact extragalactic binaries ( vlbs ) show that the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) of their central black holes ( bhs ) increases with increasing mass accretion rate .<n> however , it has been suggested that this increase is due to the black hole mass being too small compared to the stellar mass . in this letter<n> , we point out that there is a large mass in the bhs which does not contribute to the increase in @xcite . <n> black hole ( bh ) mass is one of the most important factors which determines the properties of the accreting bhs ( a bhs is a compact object with a mass much larger than the rest of the universe ) . for a given mass ,<n> the mass of the bh is related to the number of its components , i.e. to the total number of components . recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of binary systems consisting of two or more bhs of similar masses , which are orbiting a common centre of mass with a well - defined mass - luminosity relation . due to their compactness , the binary system is expected",

euclidian case , starting with brukner , shapiro and zworski ( see , e.g. , [ eq : bp ] ) . in this short note<n> we establish a bound on the intrinsic distance between points in the plane that is sharper than any known bound in the literature , for the following cases : ( i ) if the distance is equal to the sum of the lengths of the geodesic segments between the two points , ( ii ) for any angle between the segments , the distance can not be smaller than the angle of the first we show that the geodesic curvature of a line can be computed in terms of the first and second derivatives of its projection on the real line .<n> this is done by proving a new version of the well -

[ eq : upper bound for regularity ] in section 1 ) . since this bound is quadratic , it is not surprising that there is no upper in this note , we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between piecewise @xmath0 self - intersecting loops in the plane and certain sle(4 ) compactly supported vector fields on the circle .<n> we use this correspondence to show that for a class of piecewise self - intersections , there is an upper bound on the dimension of the vector field that can be realized as a self - intersection of a given loop . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to prove that a vector field can be supported on a circle with dimension at most two if and only if it is self - intersectable . <n> the notion of a _ compact _ vector field was introduced by john von neumann @xcite in the context of riemannian geometry . since then , it has found numerous applications in many fields of mathematics and physics . in particular , in the case of vector fields , the compactness property has been used to prove the existence of one -

nucleon interaction .<n> the method is based on the exact diagonalization of the time - dependent density matrix , which is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the probability distribution of the energy level difference between the two nucleons . in this way<n> , we are able to calculate the nuclear structure factor . <n> recently , it has been shown that the interaction of a single nucleon with a nuclear medium is determined by the structure of the hamiltonian , i.e. , by the matrix elements of the interaction potential . for that purpose ,<n> the so - called  nuclear matrix elements '' ( nids ) have been introduced in refs . @xcite , where they have been shown to be the equal parts of the amplitudes of the two hamiltonians in the nid - interaction potentials at the same energy level . as a consequence , the nuclear nid s are the same as the corresponding matrix elements in the single - particle basis . however , in the case of nuclear interactions , they are different from each other , and we present a new approach to the study of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems .<n> the method is based on the solution of the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which describes the evolution of the system from an initial state with a given energy to a final state with zero energy . in this way<n> , we are able to obtain a generalization of the well - known landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) theory for phase transitions . as an example we consider the case of a system of two coupled oscillators where the energy difference between the two oscillators is equal to the phase difference of the initial state . <n> phase transitions ( pts ) are one of the most important phenomenon in condensed matter physics , occurring in a wide variety of systems ranging from single molecule emitters to biological cells @xcite . at a fundamental level ,<n> pt is defined by the energy gap between the ground state energy and the energy of the excited state @xmath0 , where the system is described by the hamiltonian , i.e. the eigenvalue spectrum of the ground - state wave function . on the other hand , we present a calculation of the ground state and excited state probabilities of the @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice .<n> we find that , contrary to the case of the ising model , both the ground and the excited states are exponentially localized in the region of the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition . in the limit of a large number of spins ,<n> the density - matrix renormalization group approach is able to reproduce the results of the exact diagonalization . <n> _ introduction : _ the problem of the emergence of the quantum spin liquid phase from the anti - ferromagnetic phase is one of the most important problems in the field of strongly correlated quantum matter @xcite . to this end<n> , it has been widely studied in the last few years both theoretically and experimentally , using both the mean - field theory ( mft ) and the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods . however , despite the success of the qmc approach in the description of the low - energy properties of the spin liquid , there are still many open questions , such as the robustness of the transition to the quantum paramagnetic phase , the degree of localization of we derive the bloch - redfield master equation for a particle confined in a harmonic oscillator and subject to a time - dependent external potential .<n> the master equation is solved numerically for the case of a sinusoidally modulated external potential and an arbitrary angle between the sinusoidal modulation and the wave vector of the particle . <n> the aim of this work is to study the effect of an external potential on the dynamics of a system of classical particles confined in an harmonic oscillator . in the past few years<n> , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) harmonic oscillators @xcite . due to the high degree of experimental control over the parameters of the system , it has been possible to perform a number of interesting experiments , such as the first observation of a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of ultracold atoms in 1d optical lattices and the first experimental investigation of the effects of strong repulsive interactions on the formation of a one - dimensional bose gas . at the same time , there is a growing interest in the theoretical investigation of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum particles confined we propose a method to measure the position of a photon by measuring the photon absorption spectrum .<n> the method is based on the application of a phase shift detector to a two - level atom interacting with an electromagnetic field . for a given photon<n> , the absorption spectrum can be determined by measuring a pair of quadrupole moments of the atom , which are related to the positions and momenta of the two photon bound states . in this way , we can determine the quadrupolar moment of the bound state . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of two - photon ( 2p ) absorption in various physical systems @xcite , such as quantum dots , quantum wires , and semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , as well as in quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite and quantum communication ( qc ) systems . to measure these absorption spectra ,<n> it is necessary to apply a phase - shift detector ( psd ) to the two bound states of the system . the standard method for such a measurement is to apply the phase shift @xmath0 to the bound states and then measure the total absorption spectrum we study the effect of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions on the vibrational properties of a simple model system , the ising spin chain .<n> we find that these interactions can lead to an increase of the vibrational frequencies of the system and an overall reduction of the phonon lifetimes . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in the investigation of properties of simple quantum systems , such as atoms , molecules , and nanoparticles , which are composed of a large number of weakly interacting particles . in these systems<n> there is a strong correlation between the properties of the particles and their interactions with each other . on the other hand , in the presence of strong correlations ,<n> the dynamics of these systems can be very complicated , leading to a variety of interesting phenomena . for example , it has been shown that the motion of the electrons in a quantum wire can be described by the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite , where the electrons are described by a set of coupled harmonic oscillators ( ho s ) . however , this is not the case for the electrons , as they can also interact with other degrees of freedom , e.g. , we investigate the quantum statistical properties of a two - level atom interacting with a resonantly - pumped optical cavity field .<n> we focus on the regime where the cavity frequency is in the strong coupling regime , where the atom - cavity system can be described by the bloch - siegert ( bs ) model . in this regime<n> , the bs model can be mapped onto the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which is solved numerically to obtain the cavity occupation numbers and the two - point correlation functions . for strong coupling , we find that the cavity occupancy and the photon - photon correlation functions exhibit power - law dependence on the coupling strength , with the exponents depending on the strength of the resonantly pumped field , @xmath0 , and on the relative phase between the cavity and the cavity modes , t@xmath1 . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of cavity - enhanced processes @xcite , due to their potential applications in many areas of science and technology , such as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum information processing ( qip ) @x<n> . however",

[ # 1 ] inflation @xcite has been one of the most important cosmological scenarios since the time of big bang . in this scenario ,<n> the initial conditions are such that the universe is filled with hot and dense matter , called hot dark matter ( hdm ) . during inflation , hdm<n> is considered to be non - relativistic and non - interacting , since it decays into radiation at the present time . as a result<n> , there is a possibility of an early reheating ( or reheating - de - excitation ) phase we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from late - time entropy production in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe with a cosmological constant .<n> we show that the gw spectrum has a characteristic oscillatory feature just before the phase transition , which is from the fact that , in the limit of long duration of thermal inflation , the spectrum scales as @xmath0 for the mode entering the horizon at the non - relativistic matter dominated era . also note that there is no suppression by the anisotropic stress , caused by the relativistic hartle - hawking effect , for wavenumbers smaller than the hubble scale at the epochs of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and radiation - matter equality . <n> the observation of gravitational waves @xcite is one of the most important probes of the early universe . in the standard picture of cosmology<n> , it is assumed that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , and that inflation is the mechanism that converts vacuum energy into dark energy , i.e. , dark matter ( dm ) . however ,<n> recent observations of large scale structure ( lss  we study the lepton - photon decays of a light higgs boson into a pair of photons , @xmath0 .<n> we find that , in the case where the higgs decays into a photon and a lepton , the energy density carried by the photon in a comoving volume is proportional to the inverse photon - lepton cross section . in the opposite case ,<n> when the decay into photons is forbidden by the vacuum expectation value of the photopion field , then the density of photons in the vacuum will be smaller than the vacuum density . <n> _ introduction. _<n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of a fermion field @xcite , which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . for a long time<n> it has been believed that the lsp should decay into leptons , but this was never confirmed experimentally . recently<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the study of lepton decays , mainly because of the recent discovery of the baryon asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @x<n> . also , it is we study the effect of the decay of dark radiation on the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum .<n> we find that the gw spectrum depends strongly on the initial conditions of the dark radiation . in the case where the radiation which initially dominates the universe decays into dark radiation instantaneously ,<n> the spectrum has a hill at @xmath0 , where the hubble radius is defined as @xcite . on the other hand , if the radiation decays after a brief period of thermal inflation , the spectrum is not so sensitive to the initial condition of the radiation and has a peak at a higher energy scale . <n> = 10000 gravitational wave signals from dark matter and dark radiation have been extensively studied in the past decades , both theoretically and experimentally . however , it is still an open question whether the signals from these two types of dark matter are consistent with each other . to answer this question<n> , we consider a scenario in which the universe undergoes a phase transition to a radiation - dominated state , which is followed by a period of inflation . at the same time , a part of the vacuum energy is converted into radiation , and the rest is converted to gravitational wave energy in the horizon . we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation , which is a brief period of thermal inflation caused by a scalar field .<n> we consider two cases : 1 . a period of inflation is caused by the scalar field @xmath0 , and 2 . after the phase transition ,<n> the field decays instantaneously into dark radiation @xcite . in the case 1<n> , the gw spectrum is known to be strongly suppressed due to the anisotropic stress caused by dark radiation . here , we show that the suppression is much weaker and the result is almost the same as the case of the thermal inflation . for the case 2 , on the other hand , there is a dip in the spectrum around the frequency of the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect caused by visible radiation , instead of the hill seen in the previous case . <n> _ introduction _ the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , whose energy density is proportional to the energy density of the universe . however , dm does not dominate the universe in all cases , except for the inflationary scenario we show that entropy injection during a phase transition can be detected by measuring the gw spectrum .<n> we consider several particle - physics - motivated models of phase transition and show that they can produce gw spectra with and without dark radiation . <n> the observation of gw signal @xcite is one of the most important cosmological tests of inflation , which is based on the idea that inflation is due to spontaneous breaking of the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) . in the standard inflationary scenario ,<n> a period of thermal inflation @xmath0 is introduced , followed by a short period of inflation caused by a non - relativistic scalar field , called a coherent oscillation . after the phase transition , the coherent oscillation decays into dark and visible radiation , and the vacuum energy which remains after inflation goes into the production of vacuum energy . as a result<n> , there is an injection of entropy into the universe . since this entropy injection can be caused by the anisotropic stress caused by dark radiation or by the entropy production caused by coherent oscillation in the early universe , it is called a dark energy ( de ) or entropy injection . at present , dark energy<n> is considered to be the dominant component of the we discuss 15 cases in which dark radiation is produced in the early universe , and show that some of them can be realized in particle - physics - motivated models .<n> in particular , we show that susy pq models and susy majoron models can realize the cases 15 . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the case without dark radiation , the amplitude of the oscillation around the minimum of the susy breaking potential is @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the present upper limit @xcite . however , if the dark radiation has a short period of thermal inflation and coherent oscillation domination , then the oscillation amplitude may be as large as , or even larger than , that of the standard model ( sm ) at present . in this case<n> , it may be possible to distinguish the two cases by precise measurements of the height of the spectrum at the epoch of the phase transition , as well as by measuring the ratio of the gw spectrum at that epoch to that at that moment . for the case with dark radiation and a long period of inflation ,<n> the ratio is smaller and the amplitude is larger than the sm prediction , but the we propose a new mechanism for the production of dark radiation , which is based on the coherent oscillations of the axion multiplet in the early universe . in this mechanism ,<n> the vacuum energy of the vacuum state is instantaneously transferred into the energy density of the oscillation of the field transverse to the trajectory of the pq multiplet .<n> the amplitude of the gw radiation is proportional to the ratio of vacuum energy density to the total one just before the phase transition . <n> kias -

axino dark matter halo . we find that the dissipation rate of the coherent oscillation may be larger than that of the visible - sector particles due to the interaction with the visible sector particles . as a result , the decay of the axion and saxion may be delayed .<n> we also find that if the energy density of the oscillation of the field transverse to the trajectory of saxion is larger than the one transverse to its trajectory , then the evolution of the system depends on the decay rate and dissipation rates of the fields . <n> kias -

motivated ) models of cosmological phase transition , including the peccei - quinn ( pq ) phase transitions , in general lead to complicated structures in the gw spectrum , which might be detectable in future space - based gw detectors . hence , if the spectrum of the inflationary gw is determined by future experiments , it will give clues to the high - energy physics beyond the reach of accelerator experiments . in this paper<n> we have studied various effects of a cosmological event in the first few hundred milliseconds of the big bang . among them , we pay special attention to the effect of the pq phase transition on the susy majoron model . <n> _ introduction _ in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , there is a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath0 for the dark matter ( dm ) which is proportional to the hubble parameter , and it is related to the mass of the lightest neutralino ( lh ) as well as to the masses of we study the spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) .<n> in particular , we calculate the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath0 of the amplitudes of gw perturbations in the md and rd eras . in the rd era ,<n> the gw amplitudes are proportional to the amplitude of the primordial perturbations , and hence the spectrum has a non - trivial dependence on the scale factor at which the mode enters the horizon . as a result , in the inflationary era the spectrum is non - perturbative . for the md era<n> , the spectrum can be non - oscillatory , while in the inflation era it can be oscillatory with a high frequency , which is within the reach of future space - based gw detectors . <n> inflation is one of the simplest and most promising candidates for explaining the origin of the energy density of the universe . at present , though , it is not the only option @xcite . among the many other possibilities , there is a class of models which predict the existence of a phase transition between a radiation - dominated and an inflationary - dominated universe , known as the quintessence phase transition ( pq  we consider gravitational waves ( gws ) produced in a phase of inflation with tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 .<n> we show that the effective energy density of inflationary gw s is proportional to the ratio of the amplitude of the gw to the critical density at the time of horizon exit . as a result ,<n> the effective gw energy density is larger than the energy density in the radiation era , which is in agreement with the recent wmap data . <n> the observation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite has established that the universe is spatially flat and in phases of accelerated expansion . in the standard inflationary scenario ( cas )<n> , it is assumed that the primordial curvature perturbations enter the horizon at the end of inflation and exit at some later time . at the same time , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the scalar field is expected to be nearly scale - invariant , so that the tensor component of the curvature perturbation is negligible compared to the curvature of the primordial perturbations . however , this is not the case for gravitational waves produced in the inflationary phase of the universe . we study the gravitational waves ( gws ) from the onset of thermal inflation to the phase transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we show that the gw spectrum is proportional to the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 in the intermediate frequency region , and that the mode with wavenumber at the horizon exits the horizon at the end of the thermal inflation era . <n> _ introduction _ the observation of gravitational waves @xcite is one of the most important cosmological tests for the nature of the vacuum energy in the early universe . in the standard model of particle physics ,<n> gravitational waves are considered to be generated by the vacuum fluctuations of the gravitational potential . during inflation , the energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )<n> is driven to a high value , resulting in the formation of the large scale structure of the universe , i.e. , an accelerating expansion . at the same time , in the inflationary epoch , a tiny amount of radiation is generated , which is called the primordial curvature perturbation (  primordial gw ) and plays an important role in the dynamics of the accelerated expansion : it is responsible we consider gravitational waves ( gws ) from a phase transition in the early universe where the universe was dominated by vacuum energy .<n> we find that the gw spectrum has oscillatory features with period of @xmath0 , which depends on the ratio of vacuum energy density to the matter energy density at the phase transition . <n> _ introduction._@xmath1 recently there has been a great deal of interest in gw phenomena @xcite . in the case of gravitational waves from a type ia supernovae ( sn ia )<n> , it is well - known that the spectrum is proportional to the hubble parameter at the time of the supernovae explosion , and that the primordial density perturbations are nearly scale - invariant . on the other hand ,<n> the spectrum of a gw from a cosmological phase transition is not so well - defined , although it has been well - established that the universe is dominated by radiation before thermal inflation and the vacuum energy immediately goes to radiation after the phase transitions . here<n> we show that the global picture of gw spectral shape is not correct , if we consider a universe which is matter - dominated before and after thermal inflation , with varying the we study the effect of gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation on the phase transition of the universe from a decelerating phase to a accelerating phase .<n> we show that the gw spectrum has two peaks , one at the transition and the other at the exit of the horizon , which are separated by @xmath0 at the critical point , where the universe begins to inflate . as a result<n> , the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations is significantly enhanced , and the ratio of the amplitudes of the two gw peaks is larger than unity . <n> inflation is one of the most fundamental phenomena in modern cosmology . during inflation ,<n> the energy density in the universe increases exponentially , resulting in the formation of large scale structure @xcite . at the same time , in the early stage of inflation ( called the inflationary epoch ) , a phase transition occurs , during which the universe starts to inflate and collapse . in this phase transition , radiation from the innermost region of the expanding universe<n> is accelerated by the gravitational field of the ambient medium , leading to the accelerated expansion of the early universe , called the cosmological constant ( cc)@xmath1 era . we study the effect of the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 on the formation of primordial black holes ( bhs ) .<n> we show that the eos can suppress the gravitational wave background ( gw ) by suppressing the amplitude of the primordial gw signal . as a result ,<n> the bh bh masses are increased and the gw power spectrum becomes softer . <n> the primordial black hole ( bh ) plays an important role in the history of the universe since it is the source of most of the energy density . in the standard cosmological model ( scm )<n> , it is assumed that the universe is filled with hot dark matter ( dm ) which is responsible for the acceleration of the expansion of our universe @xcite . however , the observational evidences for the existence of dm in the form of baryons and electrons have never been confirmed . on the other hand , recent observations of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies<n> have shown that the present universe is spatially flat and there is an excess of the temperature of the dm gas , @x we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be expressed as the sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the energy density of the universe and the other is a linear function of the hubble parameter .<n> the former corresponds to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dark matter ( dm ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , while the latter corresponds to an eos of the r - parity violating supersymmetric grand unified theory ( sugra ) with extra dimensions . as a result<n> , the curvature of the eos @xcite can be naturally expressed as a sum of the two terms and the vevs of the dm and the sugra can be obtained as a consequence . <n> one of the important features of the supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm ( sm ) is the so - called r - symmetry . in this class of models ,<n> the tachyon field of the susy sm is stabilized by the sfermion fields of the higgs mechanism , and the sm is stable against spontaneous symmetry breaking (  we study the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon on the planck data in the framework of supersymmetric @xmath0 gauge theory .<n> we find that the effect is important for planck kinematics , while it is negligible for the atmospheric and solar neutrinos . <n> supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) due to its naturalness and low - energy constraints . among them<n> , it has the advantage of being free from the so - called  cosmological constant problem '' . in the susy framework ,<n> the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino which has a mass of about tev and decays dominantly into a pair of charged leptons ( leptons or quarks ) . as a result , there are a large number of physical particles in the theory , such as supersymmetric particles as well as quarks and antiquarks , which play important roles in particle physics and cosmology . for a proper description of the properties of these particles , one has to take into account not only the mass of the lightest particle we point out that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale and the dark matter ( dm ) relic density .<n> we show that , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the relic dm density is proportional to the square of the corresponding supersymmetry breaking scale . as a result ,<n> the relic density of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can be much higher than the present upper limit of the dm relic density from the direct detection experiments if the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale is of the order of the planck scale or higher . <n> the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will provide a crucial test of the sm and its extensions . in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) the lightest neutralino ( lc ) plays the role of a dm particle , which decays into dm and sm leptons and quarks @xcite . however , due to the absence of a sm dark matter , there is no possibility of directly identifying the lc",

lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe filled with a single massive scalar field .<n> we show that the spectrum of the perturbations is determined by a single parameter , which can be related to the coupling of the scalar field to the matter content of the flrw universe . using this relation<n> , we estimate the amplitude of the spectrum and show that it is of the order of @xmath0 . <n> [ [ section ] ] the observation of gravitational waves has been the main source of theoretical interest since the early days of cosmology @xcite . in the standard flrw model ,<n> the universe is filled by a massless scalar field which is coupled to matter via the scalar potential . at the same time , the cosmological expansion is driven by a scale factor which is proportional to the square of the hubble parameter . as a consequence , _<n> i.e. _ , there is a singularity at which the curvature is non - vanishing . for sufficiently large values of the scale factor , this singularity<n> is referred to as a bounce , and it is expected that the universe we present an exact solution to the einstein - hilbert - robertson - walker ( erdw ) equation for the scalar field perturbations in the early universe .<n> the solution is found to be in excellent agreement with the full quantum mechanical calculation . in the standard inflationary scenario ,<n> the universe undergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath0 , which is known to be preceded by a bounce at a larger value of the temperature . at the same time<n> , the scale factor grows at a constant rate . <n> the bounce takes place at a different temperature , at which the scale factors of the two inflationary phases merge , and the universe enters a new phase of accelerated expansion , dubbed the hot big bang ( bhb ) . for a proper description of the bounce , it is necessary to take into account the curvature of the universe at the time , as described by the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the curvature operator @xcite . as a result , _<n> ( i )<n> _ the bardeen s potential is no longer a unique function of the scale , but is a function of time ; _ ( ii  we study the effect of anisotropies in a scalar field potential on the propagation of gravitational waves .<n> we show that , in the case of an isotropic potential , the spectrum of the fluctuations is modified by the presence of a bounce , and that the height of the central peak and the position of the wings of the perturbations are modified as well . <n> gravitational waves ( gws ) are waves that propagate through space at a constant velocity @xmath0 . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the gravitational field is proportional to the mass of the graviton @xcite . however , there are many theories that have been proposed in order to reconcile the sm with observations . among these<n> are theories that make use of gravitons as elementary particles , such as brans - dicke ( bd ) models , which have been extensively studied in the context of string theory , see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein . for these theories , a gw is a massive particle , with a mass and coupling constant that are proportional to its charge and mass squared , respectively . as a consequence , we study the interaction of a wave packet with a one - dimensional barrier potential .<n> we show that the wave packet can be described by a piecewise piecewise potential of the form @xmath0 , where the parameters are the energy and the wave number . in the limit of vanishing wave number<n> , we recover the well - known result that the interaction with the barrier leads to the formation of a regular pattern of wave packets . <n> wave packet dynamics has been a subject of intense interest since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . for the description of wave packet interaction with potentials of arbitrary shape ,<n> the schrdinger equation is usually used . however , in many situations , e.g. , when describing the transport of electrons in nanowires , the potential is of a non - local form , such as a barrier , or more generally , an infinite piecewise periodic function . as a result , for example , one can not solve for the transmission of electrons through a potential barrier in the usual way , _<n> i.e. _ , by using the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation . on the other hand in this paper , we introduce a new class of one - dimensional potentials , the so - called _ parabolic models _ , which can be viewed as generalizations of the well - known _ isotropic heisenberg models_. we show that these models can be used to describe a variety of physical systems .<n> in particular , these models describe the motion of a particle in a random potential , such as a spin in an optical lattice , in a magnetic field , or in a quantum hall system . <n> _ introduction. _ one of the most important problems in the physics of low - dimensional quantum systems is the question of the nature of the ground state . in this context<n> , it has been known for a long time that a ground state of a quantum many - body system can be described by a schrdinger equation @xcite , if the coupling between the system and the environment is weak . however , this is not the case in general , for example in the case of the ising model , where the coupling to the environment leads to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0-symmetry of the wave function . on the other hand ,<n> the we show that a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type potential can be constructed from a kummer hypergeometric function and its derivative .<n> the resulting potential has a non - trivial spectrum and can be used to model the interaction of a bose - einstein condensate with a quantized magnetic field . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 11.10.lm , 05.30.-d , 03.65.-w the study of quantum field theory is based on the concept of interacting many - body systems as described by the bcs theory @xcite . in this theory ,<n> the interaction between a system and its environment is given by a potential @xmath0 , which is a generalization of the well - known lieb - liniger potential . for a system in thermal equilibrium<n> , this potential describes the quantum fluctuation of the system s observables , such as energy and magnetization , under the influence of an external field , provided that the system and the external field are allowed to renormalize their mutual interaction . as such , it is well known that a system interacting with a quantum field can be described we study the effect of an external magnetic field on a bose - einstein condensate in an optical trap .<n> we show that the interaction between the condensate and the magnetic field leads to the formation of a condensate - vortex pair , which in the limit of zero magnetic field can be seen as a vortex - antivortex pair . in this limit ,<n> the spectrum of the system is determined by the interplay between the vortex pair and the external field . <n> the study of the interaction of a quantum system with an external field has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein and hawking @xcite on the quantum hall effect . since then , the field of ultracold atoms has become an active area of research , in part motivated by the possibility of observing the interaction with atoms in optical traps . as a result of recent experimental advances , it is now possible to trap ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices and to study their interaction with external fields , _<n> e.g. _ by means of bragg spectroscopy . at the same time<n> , one is also able to study the dynamics of the quantum system by following the temporal evolution of the density of states @x we study the propagation of cosmological perturbations through a general relativistic bounce .<n> we find that the perturbations propagate through the bounce with a velocity proportional to the square root of the logarithm of the scale factor , in contrast to previous studies , where the velocity was assumed to be proportional to @xmath0 . <n> we also study the spectrum of tensor modes at the bounce and find that , contrary to what is claimed in the literature , there is no transition from tensor to scalar perturbations , but rather a transition between tensor and scalar perturbation modes . in the standard model of cosmology ,<n> the scalar field is the source of gravitational waves , which propagate along the hubble flow @xcite . as a result<n> , gravitational waves are expected to be present in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , as well as in other astrophysical systems , such as galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the interstellar medium ( ism ) . for a long time , it was believed that the gravitational wave background would be completely unobservable to an observer at large distances , and hence that the cmb radiation would not be observable at all . recently , however , this we present a bouncing solution for the einstein - maxwell - dirac equations in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath0 .<n> the solution describes the evolution of tensorial and scalar perturbations during a bounce ; it does not depend on the value of the cosmological constant and can be applied to a wide range of physical situations , including the early universe . in particular<n> , it can be used to study the radiation - to - matter transition in the standard cosmological model . <n> einstein and maxwell s equations @xcite are the most studied equations in physics because of their simplicity and generality . for the latter ,<n> it is natural to ask whether they can be improved in some way to account for the effects of gravity . to answer this question , in the past few years<n> a number of works have been done in this direction . among these<n> are the derivation of modified maxwell equations for the dirac equation ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a recent review ) , as well as the extension of the maxwell theory to the case of non - vanishing gravitational couplings ( see refs . @x <n> ] and , more recently we show that the radiation - to - matter transition in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with a cosmological constant can be described in terms of a phase transition .<n> the transition is triggered by the presence of a bardeen - stephen fluid with a negative pressure , and it can be understood as the transition from a radiation - dominated era to a matter - dominated one . in the radiation dominated era ,<n> the spectrum of perturbations is frozen during the transition , whereas during the bounce , the perturbations are renormalized and the spectrum is again frozen , at least in the region of potential crossing . for a given wave number @xmath0<n> , this transition can be well approximated by the transition of radiation to matter with a scale factor that is much smaller than the hubble size at the time of the transition and much larger than the scale factor at the end of the radiation era . <n> the standard picture of cosmology is based on a spatially homogeneous and isotropic frw model , which describes the evolution of the large - scale structure of the universe up to the present time . at the same time , however , there is a problem with this picture we study the evolution of scalar gravitational perturbations in the closed spatial section of a de sitter - like bouncing solution of einstein s equations .<n> we show that this bouncing solution can serve as a  laboratory '' for the study of non - linear field theory in curved space - times . in this context , we find that the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations at the bounce , whereas the potential is the quantity that matters , in contrast to what happens in the pre big bang case . <n> gravitational waves are a powerful probe of the early universe , being sensitive probes of both the physical conditions at the time of their production and the structure of the universe at that time . as a consequence ,<n> they have been used to test various models of early universe physics , such as inflation @xcite , brane - world models of structure formation , and models of phase transitions , among others . at the same time , they have also been studied in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) , with the aim of understanding the role played by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a field in the formation and evolution of structure  in a recent paper @xcite , we have proposed a mechanism for the generation of gravitational waves in the early universe , based on the bounce of the inflaton in the minkowski space - time .<n> the mechanism is quite general and can be expected to play an important role in string - motivated inflationary models . in this paper<n> we elaborate further on the results of ref . <n> @xmath0 , and show that this mechanism does not violate causality , does not lead to any modification of the spectrum of gravitational wave perturbations at the bounce and does not require a high curvature phase in order for the spectrum to be affected . as a consequence ,<n> the gravitational wave spectrum can not be affected by propagating through a bounce ; hence , there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through the bounce , as is the case for instance in many string motivated scenarios . *<n> pacs : * 04.62.+v , 04.50.+h , 98.80.cq , 95.35.+d , 11.27.+d the origin of the universe is one of the most important unsolved problems of modern physics . since einstein s we study the cosmological dynamics of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic frw background .<n> we show that the dynamics of the universe is determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy , which can be either positive or negative , depending on the value of the scale factor . for negative values ,<n> the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion , while for positive values the eos is preserved and the universe enters the radiation -

to - codon stochastic mutations .<n> we show that the mapping from major transfer pattern 1 2 to mutagen index can be used to design the treatment plan . in order to run the simulation ,<n> we assign numerical values to probabilities . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of designing an optimal control policy ( ccp ) for a stochastic system is of great interest in bioinformatics , biophysics , optimization , and computational biology @xcite . for example , it is well known that the optimal treatment plan ( amp ) can significantly improve the performance of a biomedical or pharmaceutical treatment by minimizing the total cost of treatment , or , in other words , the cost of surviving . on the other hand , stochastic systems are more complex than their deterministic counterparts , which means that the complexity of the ccp is also higher . as a result<n> , there is a need to consider the influence of the stochastic nature of the system on the design of the amp , as well as its influence on the performance . the codon to codon ( codon ) mutation is a well - known example of stochastic in this paper , we present a mathematical model to deal with mutations in the process of dna replication in the view of control systems . different from the existing models , our model is constructed directly from the basic biological theories , the central dogma in molecular biology , and the complementary base pair for dna molecules with double helix structure . it provides instrumental information of molecule interactions in gene mutation for biologists and doctors to gain a better understanding of cellular and tissue level systems ' behavior .<n> higher dimensional optimal control problems , codon - to - codon stochastic mutations are of theoretical importance . in our optimal control problem ,<n> the global optimal if the step limit is larger than the number of steps that global optimal can achieve , then we have some flexibility in our treatment plan . we propose a new method to solve the codon - to - codon stochastic optimal control problem based on the concept of dynamic programming .<n> the proposed method provides a new medical intervention to genetic diseases . compared to the existing gene therapy , treatments by mutagens are safer by avoiding the side effect of virus infection , which is an essential step to identify the functional units , to examine the interactions among different segments , and to find healthy , harmful and lethal nucleotide sequences .",

known that the wavelength - dependence of optical depths can be significantly improved by using a technique known as direct frequency measurements ( dft ) @x . we report on the synthesis of lithium hydride ( lbh ) in a solution of 3 under conditions of ultra -

[<n> [ conclusions ]<n> ] conclusions : @xmath hyperoxic lung injury is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in humans .<n> previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction is a cardinal feature of this catastrophic injury , however , studies probing key tissue mitochondrial functions and the effect of oxidant injury in intact lungs in real - time are limited , because indices of mitochondrial function of in situ tissue are often different from those of tissue homogenates . here<n> , we demonstrate the utility of optical fluorometry to detect a change in the redox status of lung mitochondrial autofluorescent coenzymes nadh ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) and fad ( oxidized form of flavin adendine dinucleotide) , two important mediators of oxidative phosphorylation . <n> hyperoxics are a major cause of death and serious damage to human lungs @xcite . in addition , they are a primary cause of morbidity , mortality , and a significant contributor to global costs in the health care system , according to the american association of physics teachers ( aapt ) . despite their ubiquity ,<n> little is known about the physical mechanisms underlying hyperoxism , except for the fact that a significant fraction of all deaths result from hyperox the mitochondria of the lung are involved in a variety of processes , from the formation of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) by complex v , to the movement of hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the production of the cell s basic unit of energy , .<n> however , mitochondria are not perfect and as a result lung mitochondria can suffer from mitochondria dysfunction , which in turn affects the quality of life of individuals in the lung . in order to understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of lung disease , it is necessary to understand how mitochondria are affected by adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) phosphorylation , and how mitochondria respond to the introduction of hyperoxia into the system . to this end<n> , optical fluorometry was utilized to evaluate the effect of rat exposure to hyperoxias on lung mitochondria redox status in a nondestructive manner in intact lungs , with a long term goal of understanding the role that mitochondria dysfunction has on lung function . <n> [ [ section ] ] lung mitochondria are the major organelles of lung tissue . yet , they are poorly connected to the rest of the body and suffer from various disorders , such as incomplete endoplasmic reticulum ( er we report on the nondestructive measurement of lung mitochondria redox status in a nondestructive manner in intact lungs , with a long term goal of understanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of lung disease .<n> a fluorescence fluorometer was used to excite the fluorophores of interest , nadh and fad , using the mercury arc lamp , the excitation filters used were centered at 370 nm and 452 nm , and the power of the light emitted from the head of the probe was 50 nm . <n> measurements were made over a range of t@xmath0 from 10 to 1000 khz , over a time span of minutes to hours . from these data<n> , it is possible to determine whether or not the mitochondria in the lung are depleted in oxygen or not , as well as develop a diagnostic modality for oxygen toxicity , which we name  oxygen toxicity indicator . ''<n> the data presented in this study were obtained on bovine serum albumin in the atmosphere of an airsick cow . in spite of the airsick nature of the cow , we were able to measure the mitochondrial redox status of the lung tissue in the air for a total of 48 hours , allowing us to determine the the manipulation of fluorescent fluorophores ( nadh and fad ) in rat lung tissue has been studied using a time - resolved fiber - optic system .<n> optical imaging was performed using fad and nadh , while fluorescence detection was performed with normoxic . in both cases ,<n> the output fluorescence intensity was found to be proportional to the duration of the exposure , with a power - law dependence on the exposure time . for fad , a power law dependence of the output intensity as a function of exposure time was observed , similar to what is observed in the optical imaging . <n> the ability to manipulate and detect fluorescent fluoroophores has been of great interest to biologists , chemists , and physicists for more than a century @xcite . over the last decade<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in the use of fluorographs for optical imaging of biological systems , particularly in the study of lung tissue . to date , optical imaging has been performed on a variety of fluorescent species , including fluorescent xenon , fluorescent thiophene , fluorine , cyanopolyyne , gallium , sodium , potassium , calcium , sulfur , we present a new , state - of - the - art , non - invasive , all - optical method for pulsation imaging .<n> the method is based on an isolated , perfused preparation of the lung , followed by optical imaging and analysis of the resulting mitochondria redox state . in this way<n> , we are able to obtain a more complete characterization of the mitochondria , which are responsible for most of the energy transfer between the heart and lung duringpulsations , as well as for the production of the adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , a nucleotide responsible for the translation of energy from the mitochondria to the rest of the body . <n> the ability to measure mitochondria redox states is important for a variety of applications , ranging from the study of single cells @xcite , to the analysis of blood flow in the circulatory system ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) to the investigation of complex networks of biochemical reactions and interactions , such as those involved in the formation and destruction of nucleic acids in the earth s oceans and atmosphere , or the formation of the @xmath0 complex in the atmosphere of the earth @x in this work , we present the design and implementation of a new software package for in -

situ fertilization at any position in the cow , with high efficiency , accuracy , and scalability . using this software ,<n> we have performed quantitative studies of the efficiency and accuracy of in - vivo icf detection for different concentrations of the bsa albumin , as well as different donors and conditions of the environment . in particular , our results show that the accuracy of the detection of the albumin concentration is comparable to that of the best state - of - the - art automated detection methods , such as those based on _ in vitro _ ion - trap and _ extracellular _ flow cytoskeletal techniques . since the advent of artificial intelligence ( ai ) and machine learning ( ml ) @xcite , there has been an explosion of interest in the we investigate the effect of mechanical ventilation on the nadh and fad surface fluorescence of the inner face of a healthy human lung .<n> we find that the onset of nadh activity is associated with a decrease in the amplitude of fad activity , while the plateau -

we investigate the effects of complex oxygen species ( etc ) and protein denaturation ( nadh ) on the coupling between respiration and phosphorylation in lung exposed to hyperoxia .<n> we find that lung hyperoxic response to pcp is significantly reduced compared to normoxic response , and that the decrease in complex i activity is accompanied by a decrease in nadh signal . in this study<n> , we provide evidence that increased production of reactive oxygen species is a major pathophysiological factor in the genesis of lung injury with a possible strategy to mitigate the activities of ros sources . <n> lung injury is one of the main contributors to morbidity and mortality in the human population , with about one third of the total adult population suffering from some kind of respiratory disease @xcite . despite the ubiquity of lung damage ,<n> the mechanisms by which it occurs are not well understood , despite the fact that lung injury has been studied extensively for more than a century . among the mechanisms proposed for its origin , protein denaturation ( pd ) , a process by which the phosphorylation of the adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) network is reduced , has been proposed as a possible mechanism for lung injury @x lung microvascular endothelial cells are involved in the regulation of the development of lung alveolar system .<n> riboflavin ( ros ) plays an important role in the formation of these cells , however , it has been shown that ros is not sufficient for the proper functioning of lung tissue under hyperoxia . here<n> we show that the rate of ros formation at complex i in endothelial cells is reduced under hyperoxic conditions , and we suggest that this is an adaptive mechanism by the cells . <n> research into the mechanisms of lung development has focused on the interplay between the ros and mitochondria @xcite . in lung models ,<n> the mechanisms by which lung mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) and produce ros have been studied by means of : 1 ) in vitro experiments using ros / atp ratio ( @xmath0 ) , 2 ) experiments in mice exposed to either normoxic or hyperoxial conditions @x , 3 ) experimental studies of lung micro vascular endothelial cells exposed to both noroxia and hyperoxian agents in humans , 4 ) a study of the effects of lung pulsation on ros @x hyperoxic lung is characterized by a high degree of atp production and high levels of glycolysis .<n> it has been suggested that this is due to the increased demand for atp - driven mechanisms of lung disease compared to normoxic lungs . to test this hypothesis<n> , we performed fad and nadh in rats exposed to hyperoxia , kcn , krebsy , and pcp in order to compare the effects of lung treatment on fad signal . in the fad experiments , lung treatment with pcp , which simulates the flow of reducing equivalents through the chain ,<n> fully oxidized the chain and as a result exposed the difference in the capacities of complex ii between noroxic and hyperoxics . <n> _ introduction _ the ability to produce adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , a nucleotide responsible for the synthesis of carbon dioxide , is one of the most important elements of life , as it is involved in the formation of carbon monoxide molecules , the main constituent of our atmosphere , by far the most abundant substance in the universe . for many years , efforts have been made to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to lung disease @xcite , including we report on the detection of a decrease in the redox - sensitive flavoprotein ( nadh ) signal in normoxic and hyperoxic lung , respectively , as a function of the cytosolic nadh concentration .<n> the decrease in nadh signal was detected using two assays , one for lung surface nadh and the other for nadh fluorescence , which target the mitochondrial electron transport chain . in the presence of nadh<n> , the lung surface fluorescence did not show a significant increase in the nadh intensity due to hyperoxia - induced decrease in complex ii redox state . <n> the ability of mitochondria to remove free electrons from cells and to convert these electrons into adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) molecules is essential for the formation of ros and other complex molecules such as erythrocytes @xcite , drosophila , and myosin @xmath0 , to name a few . for many years , it has been believed that the main contributors to the ros production in mammalian cells are electrons channeled through complex i and complex ii , both of which produce 4-fold more mitochondria superoxide than electrons channeled though complex i . however , recent studies in this paper , fisher ab demonstrated that lung surface redox -

surface optical imaging .<n> the method is based on the variation of the ubiquinone ( amphipathic ) reduction signal with time during the passage of air through the lung of rats , and then compares the results to those obtained from imaging the lung surface . <n> the present method allows determining the relative contribution of different types of lung cells to the oxidorimetric signals measured at the surface of the organ , thereby providing information about the global state of the lung tissue , which is a highly valuable piece of information irrespective of the individual cell types contributing to the redox ratio . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the development of non - invasive , non - optical , surface - based methods for monitoring lung metabolism @xcite . among these methods ,<n> near - field optical ( pmt ) surface imaging ( nef - so ) has gained considerable interest due to its ability to image the global redox state of lung tissue with high spatial and temporal resolution , as well as its potential to provide new insights into the mechanisms of lung metabolism . * background : * mechanical ventilation ( mv ) is an important treatment strategy for acute lung injury ( ali ) in the intensive care unit ( ific ) and in the military .<n> many receive mv for high oxygen therapy or to monitor the progression of ali and its most severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensivecare unit . <n> applications of this tool include diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring of conditions in particular lung conditions including lung transplant related ischemia -

defined , and it is then natural to ask whether or not supersymmetry can be restored by some mechanism other than strong coupling . we study the konishi anomaly and supersymmetry breaking in a four - node quiver theory with @xmath0 symmetry .<n> the theory has a baryonic branch and a quantum - modified superpotential , both of which are argued to be broken by konishi anomalies . in the weak - coupling regime , we find a one parameter family of supersymmetric supergravity solutions , with extra d3- and d5-branes in the bulk . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] however , if we relax the calabi -

intersection point , but rather they may have a single intersection point with the boundary of the annulus ( as opposed to the interior ) . the standard procedure for removal of an arbitrary number of such annuli consists in replacing the given number by a new number ; in this case , the procedure is referred to as _<n> surgery_. in this paper , we present a new approach to the construction of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath0 arising from the geometry of self - transverse annuli .<n> the approach is based on the notion of a lambda - restricted annulus , which is a generalization of the well - known notion of an annulus from hyperbolic geometry . as an example of the application of this approach ,<n> we construct a new annuli with a single double point . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the topology of the space of spherical harmonics has a long history , going back to the work of euler and heisenberg @xcite , and extending to the more recent work of jacobi and keith @x<n> _  the lambda problem , '' _ * ? ?<n> * intro , lemma [ lem : surgery ] ( i.e. , the surgery problem ) . in recent years<n> , there has been a resurgence of interest in the lambda question , motivated in part by the recent work@xcite and partly by the discovery of a new class of symmetries , called  in this paper , we show that the @xmath0th -

parameter family of maps for which the hausdorff dimension of the ambient space is equal to the number of disks in the family , thus generalizing the well - known results of bernoulli , shapiro and zworski . the notion of a surgery disk @ we show that kirk s @xmath0 map is a link map .<n> more precisely , we prove that the intersection form of the kirk invariant is a sesquilinearity form , and we use this result to show that the image of the loop map on the unit circle is given by a laurent polynomial . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] this paper is a sequel to @xcite , where we showed that the invariant , which is a map from the real line to a line segment in the euclidean 3-space , is a finitely generated function of the integers . in the proof ,<n> we have shown that this invariant has a finite number of zeros . here<n> we give a more direct proof of this fact , based on the fact that we have a finite set of non -

in other words , if there exists a non - commutative , compact , conformal , field theory which satisfies the condition , then the spectrum of the field theory is _ continuous  we prove that null homotopy classes of @xmath0-dimensional links are completely determined by the first homology group of the ambient space . <n> [ [ abstract .<n> ] ] the study of homotopic classes of surfaces has a long history , going back to the work of freedman and kirby @xcite , habegger and lin@xcite and habegger , kirk , and teichner @x<n> . there has been a lot of progress in the last two decades , especially in the area of link maps , which have played an important role in the classification of surfaces in the four - sphere , the euclidean space and the projective plane . in this paper<n> , we will prove that the null homotopic class of a link map is completely determined , in the case when the dimension of the link is 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 , where the map is defined by a map from the four dimensional projective space to the sphere and then back , up to isotopy equivalence , to the ambient manifold . to do this ,<n> we introduce a new invariant , called the @x in this paper , we define a new link invariant , @xmath0 , of dimension four .<n> we show that it is a vassiliev invariant of link maps , and prove that it vanishes if and only if the dimension of the link is four , otherwise it does not exist . <n> introduction in @xcite , sokawa and kawauchi , in their study of unknotted surfaces in four - spaces , introduced a new invariant called the _ osaka number _ of a 2-sphere , which measures the order of the intersection numbers of 2-spheres in the link group of the sphere . since then , this invariant has been used in a variety of contexts , such as invariants of knot theory , differential manifolds , surgery theory and knot group theory . in particular , it plays an important role in the study of homotopy classes of links in the four sphere , as well as in the classification of higher - dimensional links . as an application of the invariant<n> , kamada conjectured that the intersection number of a two - sphere in a link group is a ( non - trivial ) finite set ",

infrared range , they are about two orders of magnitude larger than those in the infrared . <n> the infrared ( irac ) sky will be revolutionized in the near future , thanks to the new generation of submillimeter ( submm ) facilities ( e.g. , atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array , alma , cso , smm , sirtf ) @xcite , as well as the _ herschel _ space telescope , for the detection of faint submillimeter galaxies . today , the irac and submm are the most powerful tools the source confusion limits of infrared and submillimeter galaxy surveys are estimated , taking into account the dilution of clustering due to the survey depth .<n> we find that the confusion limits for the _ herschel _ pacs and spire surveys are @xmath0 mjy , and the limits for _ spitzer _ irac and mips , respectively , will be @xcite@xmath1 mjy for the confusion limit of @ x -

cam wide - field infrared survey . we found that the distribution of the galaxies in two dimensions is well approximated by a euclidean - slope model , and that the statistical characteristic of the galaxy distribution is strongly affected by the correlation structure of galaxies . on the other hand , in order to reproduce the _ iras _ galaxy confusion limit , the effect of flux - dependent clustering of galaxies has to be taken into account , which is observationally not fully understood yet . <n> recently , a great effort has been devoted to the study of galaxies in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite . in particular ,<n> the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has provided us with a large number of high -

scale structure of the universe @xcite . in particular<n> , the ir number counts can be used to test the cosmological model , e.g. ,  cold dark matter ' ( cdm ) , as well as to constrain the cosmological parameters . however , to date , there has not been any model that reproduces all the observed properties of infrared galaxies , such as the confusion - limit flux , power spectrum , fluctuation amplitude , etc . from the measured projected information , which is fundamentally based on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the projected intensity , rather than deep infrared galaxy surveys revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy number counts , such as a rapid increase in number counts at 90 mjy and 170 mjy , with a cumulative slope of @xmath0 .<n> however , these number counts can not be described by a power - law function , because the integrated infrared flux from galaxies must not exceed the observational constraint of the cosmic infrared background . we extended the method of toffolatti et al . <n> to calculate the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of infrared galaxy fluctuations , and found that the tail of the pdf becomes heavier . in the submillimeter wavelengths ,<n> the confusion problem will remain an important issue that should be properly considered for future airborne or space submillimetric observational projects such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture sub - millimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory _ , although present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics . as a result , we find that the effect of clustering is rather small in the present data , but it will be important to take care of the effect when we estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data that will be obtained by  source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington . fundamental assumption of the formulation is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky . however , this assumption is not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe . in this work , by making extensive use of the methods related to the point field theory , we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . based on the general formulae ,<n> we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . without clustering , the confusion limit would be 3.1mjy , 23 mjy and 138 mjy for the indices @xmath0 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .<n> we also obtained the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity , @xcite . we found a broadening of the pdf . we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure . we found a broadening of the probability density function ( pdf ) by clustering , i.e. , increase of the variance , corresponding to the increase in the confusion limit flux density . when @xmath0 approaches to 2.0 , the clustering effect becomes very severe for a power - law number counts . at @@xmath1 m ,<n> the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model of @xcite , under the same hypothetical infrared facility , are estimated .<n> at @xxmath189 m . <n> these estimates are not much different from the limits calculated without clustering [ 1.8mjy and 12.3mjy ] , respectively . the gradual flattening of the number count slope toward the fainter flux densities , which is observed for infrared galaxies , makes the clustering effects very small , even though the slope is very steep . structure formation is one of the most important problems in modern science .<n> statistical methods for counts -

poor counterparts of the main sequence red dwarfs . for secondaries outside the main - sequence gap ,<n> we apply a simple color - magnitude test to confirm that the components are physically related ; this test is particularly useful for wide secondaries , since they are expected to lie in the bluer part of the optical color magnitude diagram . among the white dwarf secondaries<n> , we find 4 pairs which are likely to be chance alignments with foreground _ hipparcos _ stars ; these could be either white dwarfs or chance red dwarf alignments , depending on the nature of the faint companion . in the red dwarf sequence<n> ; we find 6 probable or sure pairs which may be red subd warfs ; one of these is the well known hip 35756 ( g 89 -

poor spectra ) , which would make them excellent tracers of the star formation history of their host galaxies . in the last decade , the number of known spectroscopic binaries among the galactic halo population of late - type stars has increased dramatically , due to the advent of the keck lris and vlt fors instruments . at the same time , there are an increasing number of spectroscopic binaries in the field , as well as in globular clusters ( gcs ) and the lmc . among these binaries<n> are the well - known cpm objects , wide binary stars ( wbs ) are double - lined spectroscopic binaries in which the primary star is a main - sequence star and the secondary is a subgiant or a wolf - rayet star .<n> their angular separations range from a few tens of milliarcseconds to a few hundreds of astronomical units , and their relative proper motions can be as large as @xmath0 mas yr@xmath1 . here<n> we report the results of a search for pairs of stars in the _ hipparcos _ catalog and in luyten s lds catalog that are likely to be wide binaries , in which both stars are in a double - line orbit about a common , equal - mass , common proper motion ( cpm ) companion . for pairs with an estimated angular separation of 10 mas , we find 347 pairs with a relative proper motion difference of more than 100 mas yrxmath2 , of which more than half are reported here for the first time . <n> the majority of stars that are members of binary systems are of spectral types m1m8 , with a median absolute magnitude of m8 and a median color of m9 . in the most massive systems , we report the results of a search for proper motion companions to _ hipparcos _ stars in the northern sky ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) .<n> we find a total of 38 new secondaries , 6 of which have not previously been reported in the literature . <n> proper motions are a powerful tool for finding companions to nearby stars @xcite . in particular ,<n> the proper motions of stars in binary systems can be used to estimate the masses of the components of the pair , and hence the total mass of the system . to date<n> , proper motions have been used to determine the masses and luminosities of only a small number of stars , mostly white dwarfs ( wds ) in the milky way . however , the distribution of companion stars in stellar binary systems is not the same , as many secondaries are likely to be fainter than the primaries . as a result , it is not clear that the luminosity function of binary systems has a sharp cut - off at any particular mass , nor that the mass function itself has a universal cutoff . here<n> we report on a search of the sky for secondaries to nearby , main we report the discovery of a large population of wide ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) binary systems containing very - low mass secondaries .<n> our sample consists of pairs with projected orbital separations between 15 and 30,000 au , which are detected over a wide range of distances ( 15 pc to 100 parsec ) . <n> the luminosity function of the secondaries is not significantly different from that of field stars , but there is a significant deficit of low - luminosity objects compared with the field luminosity function . because of the lower limit on the proper motion of the lspm - north catalog , our detection limit for wide binaries is much larger than the canonical upper limit of 20,000 au @xcite . as a result of proper motion selection effects , pairs for which only the primary is a star<n> are lost in the glare of their bright primaries . in contrast ,<n> our detection of wide pairs with separations of only a few au suggests the existence of wide binary systems , with orbital periods of a few to a few tens of years and masses of the two components in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 m@x. the detection of the first wide binary system ( a pair composed of two main sequence stars we have conducted a survey of proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 and parallaxes for wide hydrogen -

low - mass objects . the luminosity function of the secondaries is deficient compared with that of field stars , indicating that the formation mechanisms for wide binaries are biased against secondaries of very low mass or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries . in any case , the detection of several very nearby very -low mass companions suggests that several systems remain to be discovered at larger distances . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we report the results of a survey for wide , short -

mass , high - proper - motion star , i.e. a dwarf or subgiant , with a period shorter than the age of the host star . as these objects evolve through the hertzsprung - russell diagram , they we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of our cpm search , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations . we find that the distribution of orbital separations is consistent with _ pik s law _ only up to a projected separation of 2 - 3 au . beyond that limit , the distribution shows a sudden break , and<n> can best be fitted with a power law with an exponent @xcite .<n> our data thus provides clear evidence for a break in _<n> piks law_. we further observe that the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a _ power law<n> _ with a break at large separations ( up to 3 - 5 au ) . the break occurs as interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they are formed . <n> [ firstpage ] common proper motion ( cpm ) pairs are identified among stars with distances @xmath0 pc , proper motions @xcite and parallaxes measured with the 48-inch schmidt telescope .<n> the cpm companions of stars in the _ wfpc2 _ catalog have a median mass of m@xmath1 , and the distribution of projected angular separations is consistent with pik s law ( d=2.5 ds ) for systems with orbital separations up to 200 au . beyond that range , the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a power law with an index of 1.68 . <n> the distribution in the projected separations of cpm pairs shows a break at large separations , which we suggest is the result of interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they are formed . for separations<n> @xxmath2 au , we find a distribution of separations which is also consistent with the break in piks law . at larger separations ( up to 1000 au ) ,<n> the binary frequency decreases with increasing angular separation , but at smaller separations the distribution is inconsistent with _<n> pik subdwarfs in close binary systems ( @xmath0 1m@xmath1yr ) , which are at the same distance but with similar metallicities , are subject to the same tidal perturbations as normal late - type stars .<n> however , there is no obvious relationship between the tidal field and the strength of the perturbations , and the degree of tidal distortion depends on the properties of the system . in some cases , the tidal distortion is so strong that the system is pushed to the edge of the tidal circularisation radius , where it remains for a time . <n> we show that there is a strong degeneracy between the angular momentum of the central star and the perturbation from the outer disc . as a result ,<n> the degree to which the disc is perturbed is strongly dependent on the inclination angle of the binary system , with lower inclinations being more strongly perturbed by the tidal perturbation . for a binary system with a mass ratio of 3:1 , for example , at the distance of the closest black hole to its central black hole , tidal distortion of the disc at the periastron is strongly enhanced by a factor of 2 , compared to the case of a similar binary system we present the results of a search for extragalactic subdwarfs with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at high angular resolution .<n> we find that a large fraction of the extrasolar black hole ( bh ) candidates at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) are found to be close to or at the edge of their chandrasekhar - mass bh remnant ( cmbh ) phase , and many of these bhs are found in close encounters with nearby stars . <n> bh remnant formation is strongly influenced by the presence of a circumnuclear disk , which has a large effect on the bh mass - to - light ratio ( mlr ) of the central object , as well as by the amount of mass lost by the bh due to radiation pressure from the surrounding disk . in our survey , we found that the mass - loss rate from the disk to the centre of the bh is generally higher than that from the centre to the outer edge of the remnant , suggesting that the disk mass is not constant , but varies with bh mass . for a given bh mass<n> , the mass loss rate at the centre decreases with increasing bh mass as @x we present the results of a survey of sub - chandrasekhar mass black holes ( bhs ) with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) .<n> we find that the fraction of bhs with masses above @xmath0m@xmath1 is higher in the cores of more massive bhs than in the centres of less massive ones , which is consistent with the idea that the bhs reside in larger gravitational potential wells . <n> bh mass black hole ( bhmbh ) masses range from a few @xcite ( m@xcite ) down to a few tens of gev , and thus represent a significant fraction of the total stellar mass of the universe . however , there is still a great deal of mystery surrounding the bh mass function , as it is intrinsically very different from the mass - luminosity relation predicted by cdm theory ( which predicts the mass of a black hole to be proportional to the stellar mass multiplied by the hubble constant ) and the bh masses are distributed in such a way as to be hard to determine from observations . in particular , it is not clear how bh masses scale with stellar masses , nor how the bh we present the results of a survey for subdwarfs in the galactic centre ( gc ) at redshifts @xmath0 .<n> we find that a large fraction of the objects have blue / near - infrared colours which are consistent with the formation of a disk / line - of - sight ( los ) component . however , the fraction of objects with red colours varies significantly between the gc and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) samples , with the fraction increasing towards longer wavelengths . in general , blue objects are more common in the ebl sample , which is consistent with a scenario in which the disc is embedded in the halo of the host galaxy . <n> _ introduction _ recently , it has been suggested that the central black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such as quasars and x - ray binaries , are embedded in dark matter ( dm ) halos . the central bhs are believed to be tidally or gravitationally bound to their host galaxies , and to have masses of a few to a few thousand @xcite . at early times in the life of a bh ",

bounded metrics has a long history . in the 19th century , einstein and podolsky @xcite proved the area bound for the geodesics of a spherically symmetric metric , which in turn was used by zelevinsky and others to prove the area bounds for hyperbolic and euclidean metrics . on the other hand , in the 1960 s , and following the work of andersen , jacobi and neukirch , area estimates for geodesics were introduced for general ( not necessarily piecewise symmetric ) riemanian metrics , i.e. for metrics that can be expressed as a map from an arbitrary simplicial complex into a manifold , where the boundary of the complex is the valency of the simplices in the complex and the metric is restricted to the interior of each face . since the area estimate for a we prove that the ricci flow on a @xmath0-dimensional compact riemannian manifold evolves in the same sense as the area - evolution of a simplicial complex .<n> more precisely , we show that the area of a minimizer of a smooth continuous map of the boundary of a finite simplicialcomplex evolves as the sum of the square root of the squares of the lengths of all edges of the minimizer . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]corollary [ theorem]conjecture the study of the evolution of flows plays an important role in number theory . in @xcite<n> it was shown that the hamiltonian flow of a lorentzian manifold evolving in the direction of the original flow is area - evolving , i.e. it converges to a limit as the dimension of the manifold tends to infinity . on the other hand ,<n> area - minimizing flows are not area - preserving in general , and it is not clear how they evolve in the presence of flows of this type . a natural question to ask is : what is the minimal area that one can minimize for a given area - growing map ? in this paper<n> we we consider the geodesic curvature @xmath0 of a line bundle over the unit cube and the boundary of the bundle .<n> more specifically , we consider a continuous map of the unit circle onto the line bundle that is homotopic to a lipschitz map , continuously differentiable when restricted to a segment of the boundary relative to the continuous geodesic curvature , and parameterized by a constant speed . <n> we then consider a minimizing sequence for this continuous map . in this case<n> we can show that the sum of the lengths of all minimizers is equal to the product of the length of the minimizer and the speed of the continuous map relative to this boundary . as a corollary<n> we obtain the existence of minimizers with geodesic curvature bounded away from the vertices and a lower bound for the maximal geodesic curvature that can be reached along a minimizer . the notion of a geodesic curvature ( @xcite )<n> was introduced by john von neumann in his study of the riemannian metric on the geodesics of the plane . since then , it has been used by many mathematicians to study the geometry of closed geodesic curves , in particular in the context of hyperbolic plane curvatures ( see for example @x in this note , we prove the existence of convex submanifolds of @xmath0 , the set of non - negative integers .<n> we also show that the convex hull of the intersection of two convex hulls is not convex . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of convex hulls has a long history . in @xcite , lloyd proved that every convex hull is a convex hull . for a symmetric hull<n> , there is a natural parameterization by the maximum of the euclidean norm of the component of the path between two points on the hull that is shorter than the distance between the two points . on the other hand , for a non - symmetric hull ,<n> there is no such parameterization , so that it is natural to ask if there exists a parameterization that is symmetric relative to the parameterization of the hull ( here we use the definition [ def : simplcomplex ] for the sake of simplicity ) . a natural notion of symmetry is the minimal set of convex hull parameters that can be parameterized by a given convex hull parameterization ( see definition [ lem : minimal set ] below )<n> . then in @ we study the regularity of maps @xmath0 restricted to rectifiable loops .<n> more precisely , we consider maps that are parameterized by isoperimetric distance to an axis , the maximum euclidean norm of the radial component of all points on the axis ( i.e. the maximal distance from the axis ) , and the injectivity radius of the loop . <n> this paper is the continuation of a series of papers @xcite , where we have studied the regularity and approximation properties of maps restricted to loops of constant curvature . in this paper<n> we consider the following more general class of maps : we consider planar maps that can be decomposed into a large number of subdivisions , each of which parameterizes an interval . here<n> the parameterizations of the subdivisions are chosen to be small enough such that the map has regularity on every edge . for each parameterization ,<n> we give a complete characterization of all the subdivisions and show that they converge to zero as the mesh size approaches zero . as a corollary<n> we obtain a complete description of the set of subdivisions that parameterize the boundary of the map , which is equivalent to the description of a finite set of points in eucli we obtain improved bounds on the area gain for a competitor to the injectivity radius of the real line .<n> more precisely , we show that if @xmath0 is the injective radius of a point on the real plane , then the following area gain is attained : @xcite this bound is asymptotically sharp , so it is much stronger than the best area gain bounds that have been known up to now . <n> the aim of this paper is twofold . on the one hand<n> we are interested in area bounds that are tight in the sense that we can not increase the area by more than a factor of two ; on the other hand we want to show that our bounds are sharp . in the first part of the paper we will give an overview of some recent results on area bounds . here<n> we will focus on the case of euclidean distances , since this is the simplest case where we can apply our results to . for the sake of clarity ,<n> let us recall briefly the definition of an area gain bound , which is the smallest area gain that can be obtained for a given set of points in the plane with a given constant injectivity , i.e. for a point @ in this note we show that the intrinsic distance between any two points in @xmath0 is bounded from below by the extrinsic distance between the two points .<n> more precisely , we prove that the following is true : the distance between two points on the unit circle in the plane is bounded by the intrinsic ( i.e. extrinsic ) distance between them . <n> [ [ section ] ] the intrinsic and extrinsic distance is defined as the sum of the extrinsic and intrinsic distances at each point . in this paper<n> we prove the following result : @xcite . for any point in @ x ,<n> the intrinsic , extrinsic and extrinsic distances are bounded from above by the following integers : + 1 ) the distance to the center of the plane . [ [ eq : lminusdcubebound]]@xmath1 the following question is posed : what is the distance function between two given points on @x ?<n> this question has been studied in the literature in various ways , see e.g. the references therein and references therein ( cf . the list of references is extensive ) . here<n> we are interested in the following questions : ( i ) we prove that the geodesic speed of a face of the plane is at least @xmath0 times the speed of light if and only if the faces have positive hausdorff measure .<n> moreover , if the face is convex , then there is a geodesic minimizer . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]corollary [ theorem]conjecture [ theorem ] definition [ theorem][ theorem]proposition this paper is concerned with the following question : what is the fastest possible way to travel from one place to another in a plane ?<n> it is well - known ( cf @xcite ) that the fastest way to reach a given destination is to take the shortest possible route , i.e. take the one that minimizes the amount of travel time . in this paper , we show that this fastest possible route is the same for all faces of a given plane , provided that they have the same geodesic curvature , are of the same dimension , and are of convex shape . for a complete list of references ,<n> see @xxcite and the references in the introduction to this paper ( cf , for example , [ eq  we prove that the geodesic curvature of a loop in @xmath0 is equal to the curvature of the tangent line of the loop .<n> we also show that if the loop has infinitely many self - intersections , then its geodesic curvature is zero . <n> the purpose of this paper is twofold . on the one hand , we are interested in the existence of solutions to the following : * the _ plateau problem _ , which states that for a given self - intersection there exists a solution to the plateau problem that is smooth , harmonic and almost conformal on the interior of the plane . in this paper ,<n> we show that there are infinitely many ( possibly infinitely many ) solutions to this problem for loops that are piecewise smooth and that are contractible in the plane @xcite<n> . we will assume that the lipschitz function on the loop is differentiable almost everywhere and that it can be computed in terms of the first and second derivatives of the curve in a local coordinate system . as a corollary<n> , it follows that there exist infinitely many non - self - intersecting solutions of the geodesic plateau problem for piecewise contractible immersions of the circle with finitely many branch points . in this note we give a solution to the long - standing plateau problem in the plane , namely , the determination of the distance between two endpoints of a plane curve .<n> in particular we solve the plateau problem for curves that are contractible in @xmath0 and piecewise euclidean space - time immersions . <n> the plane is the real line , and the curve under consideration is a curve that is embedded in the circle . in this paper<n> we deal with the problem of determining the distance of two curves in a plane that are connected by a finite number of curves that differ only in their derivative and in the sign of their derivative ( see @xcite for a review of the subject ) . here<n> we are interested only in the case in which the two curves differ in their right and left - derivatives , which is the so - called  plateau problem '' for the planar case . for a detailed description of the methods used in the proof of the main result , see below : [ prop : plateau problem ] the riemann - hilbert problem is to find a way to determine the  distance '' between two points on the plane in terms of the derivative and sign of the let @xmath0 be the set of all riemann surfaces of the form @xcite .<n> we prove that the distance between two branch points of @x , defined by the minimal surface equation @ xmath1 , goes to infinity as @xxmath2 . <n> the notion of a  minimal surface '' was introduced by kirchhoff in his study of the boundary value problem for the schrdinger equation on the circle @x<n> . then it turned out that minimal surface problems play an important role in the study of boundary value problems for general hyperbolic systems . in his seminal paper @xcitation , kirschhoff considered the following question : what is the distance of a point on the boundary of a general hyperbolic surface to the point that is at the same distance from it ?<n> he observed that the answer to this question depends on the regularity of the surface : for example , the distance goes to zero if and only if the surface is flat on the real line . on the other hand , in his later papers , hass studied the question in more detail : is it possible to construct a minimal surface for which the distance from any branch point to the other one in this note , we show that the douglas - type condition is equivalent to the subadditivity of the map @xmath0 under the restriction that the area of the remaining components of the loop is bounded by a constant .<n> more precisely , the following are proved : 1 . <n> the map is a piecewise immersion ; 2 . the restriction of the extension of this map to a loop of bounded area does not necessarily have to be the same for all components of this loop ; 3 . in the case<n> in which the restriction is of the form : ( a ) the loop does nt intersect in its interior , ( b ) any two distinct segments do not intersect in their interiors , or ( c ) there is a straight line connecting two distinct parameters in the loop , there is an upper bound on the amount of area remaining bounded by the remainder of the loops : we also prove that this upper bound is equal to the sum of the area and the sum over all components . for completeness ,<n> we briefly recall the methods of hass ( @xcite ) . on the way<n> , a note is added on the relationship between the do we derive a variational identity for the barrier in the sense of @xcite . <n> the concept of a self - intersection is introduced and we show that it can be used to derive variational identities for a variety of boundary value problems . as an application , we give a new proof of the existence of self - intersections in the @xmath0 problem . in this paper<n> we are interested in the regularity of a family of smooth riemannian metrics on the boundary of a smooth manifold .<n> we recall that the pull - back form of these metrics is the volume form of a metric of the form of the schwarzschild metric on a disk . for a given constant<n> , there is an integrable family of such metrics and we consider the following boundary value problem ( bp ) : find a metric @x , which is invariant under the action of the metric , on the set of all non - intersecting , self - intersecting edges of the boundary . here , the bp is defined in the following way : consider the pullback of the corresponding riemman flow to the surface of the disk , and consider the metric on the interior of the surface . we prove that the geodesic flow in @xmath0 has a self - intersection almost everywhere ( except at finitely many non - finite points ) . <n> the study of self - intersections of geodesic flows has a long history @xcite .<n> there are , in fact , infinitely many self - intersecting geodesic flows . in this paper<n> , we will analyze the combinatorics of the so called _ self - junctions _ , i.e. , geodesic flows that have two or more endpoints at the boundary , where any two distinct edges may only intersect in their endpoints . for simplicity ,<n> we will assume that the metric on the boundary is given by the product of two metrics , which we call the _ geodesic curvature _ of the flow and the metric of the boundary ( see [ eq : curvature_equation ] )<n> . then the flow can be parameterized by the geodesic curvature and the boundary metric , and so on . as an example , consider the following question : what is the smallest geodesic curvature that can be represented by a smooth flow ?<n> this is a difficult question to answer because the answer is difficult to estimate because the we prove that the geodesic flow on @xmath0 $ ] is almost surely hyperbolic , i.e. there exists a non - zero geodesic flow with the following properties : 1 . <n> every geodesic flow is almost sure to be hyperbolic .<n> 2 . every flow that is geodesic in the sense that the area of the geodesics is bounded by the product of the area with the euclidean metric . for flows that are not geodesic<n> , we derive a variation formula that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the almost sureity of a given geodesic flow . we present a variational principle for euclidean space - time .<n> the principle is based on the notion of variational distance , which is expressed in terms of the speed of light . as an application<n> , we show that the riemannian metric on euclidian space can be replaced by a continuously differentiable map whose derivative vanishes everywhere . <n> variational theory is a powerful tool in the study of classical and quantum mechanics @xcite . in quantum mechanics ,<n> the concept of variation is central , as it is the basis of the celebrated heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath0 , and it is used in the derivation of the eigenvalues of the quantum harmonic oscillator . on the other hand , in classical mechanics variation<n> is more difficult to define , because it is associated with the quantization of a classical field , i.e. with the emergence of a new quantized state of matter . for the solution of the equations of motion of the classical einstein field<n> it is also necessary to introduce quantization in order to obtain the solutions of the corresponding einstein - hilbert problem . moreover , it is well - known that the classical solution can not be we show that a scalar product on the right hand side of a variational difference equation is not a priori zero if and only if it is zero on the left hand side .<n> we use this result to show that the hausdorff distance between any two solutions of an ordinary differential equation with a point charge @xmath0 on the boundary of its domain is equal to the sum of the difference of two integrals over the boundary . <n> the  point charge '' of an equation is the charge of the boundary surface of the equation . in the standard formulation of differential equations ,<n> this boundary surface is given by the riemann surface @xcite , which is a convex set in the complex plane , and the value of the point charge can be chosen to be either zero or one . for an equation with point charge<n> , it is natural to assume that the boundary value is zero and one may choose the boundary element to be any point , for example , a point of the euclidean plane or a line on the real line . if the charge is non - zero , the boundary point charge is zero . on the other hand , if the point value is a rational number  we prove a new variational inequality that is satisfied by @xmath0 of all compactly supported vector functions in @xcite .<n> the inequality is also extended to the case when the vector function is bounded away from zero . <n> variational inequalities ( vi ) are important in the theory of discrete dynamical systems , where they are used to prove the existence of solutions . in this paper , we study variational equations that are related to the well - known variational theorems of skorokhod and shklovskii ( ss ) . here<n> we are interested in the case in which the right hand side of the variational equation is bounded from below by a vector function @x geq - sum_substackemptyset neq i ' cap i  i ' $ ] , i.e. , in the sense that the right handed side of every variational difference equation is a priori known , but the summands of the difference equations are not . for this reason ,<n> we call such difference equations _ variational _ , and we study them in the present paper . the we prove that the area evolution of a closed @xmath0-manifold with finite simplicial complex boundary obeys an area - evolution equation .<n> more precisely , we show that the geodesic curvature of any compact riemannian manifold with finitely many faces is bounded from below by the area of the manifold , provided that the metric is smooth . <n> this paper is devoted to the study of area evolution for compact , closed manifolds . in @xcite area evolution was used to describe the behavior of geodesic curvature as a function of area for a large class of closed , finitely supported , smooth , and compact metrics . for such metrics ,<n> area evolution under area - evolving boundary conditions was also studied , but it was not known whether the boundary area was bounded from above or from below . here<n> we present the results that are necessary and sufficient to establish the existence of a boundary area evolution equation for such closed metrics with a finite number of faces . in this note we introduce a new method to study the plateau problem in @xmath0-manifolds .<n> the method is based on the notion of a time dependent quantity which we call  minimizer '' . in particular , we study the evolution of minimizers in a ricci flow . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] consider a closed , finite @xcite-manifold @xxmath1 , and consider a time independent , smooth , continuous map @x<n> mathbb r$ ] such that the geodesic curvature of the minimal disk is zero . for any @x ,<n> consider a flow of the form , for each positive real parameter ,  ricci  = frac1n  labeleq1,endaligned ] ] where the flows @x_lambda  > sqrt1  $ ] are constructed by embedding a finite , simplicial complex , denoted by h , '' and a continuous map  h <n> r  mrp2[frac , q]$ we prove that for every @xmath0 there is a smooth , harmonic , almost conformal map from the boundary of the unit circle to the interior of a minimal disk whose sectional curvatures are not larger than the corresponding ambient ones .<n> this implies the existence of time - independent bounds on the ricci curvature of minimal disks with smooth boundary . <n> the proof of the main result is based on the following lemma : 1 . suppose that for some time @x ] , there is an embedded , smooth minimizer for the corresponding minimization problem , i.e. a minimal riemannian manifold with geodesic curvature less than the ambient one . denote the time - derivative of this minimizer by ( [ eq : derivativeonface])$ ] and consider the target space as a minimal one - parameter family of surfaces . for every point in this family ,<n> denote by @xcite its sectional curvature in the direction of the image of the minimizer . then for every time<n> ] there exists an embedded minimal disk with boundary that is smooth and has sectional curvature less or equal to the ambient sectional curvature . in this case<n> , the target manifold is a we prove a new version of the euler - lagrange equations for the riemannian two - dimensional homogeneous maxwell system .<n> more specifically , we prove the existence of solutions to the so - called _ plateau problem _ for harmonic embeddings of the boundary circle of a minimal surface into the tangent space of a general three - dimensional manifold . <n> let @xmath0 be a two dimensional minimal surface . denote its image by _<n> elliptic embedding_. denote the image of the target manifold by @xcite . in this paper<n> we prove : * theorem [ eq : lemma](a ) * : there is a solution to the plateau problem for elliptic embedded loops that is smooth up to the boundary away from finitely many points and that satisfies the douglas - type condition . moreover , this solution has local regularity that is locally in the ( ambient ) geodesic curvatures . * <n> theorem [ theorem](b ) : we show that there is an embedded loop that is not differentiable and whose geodesic curvature satisfies the plateau condition , that is , it is locally geodesically flat . the proof is based on the we study the evolution of the geodesic curvature of a smooth solution of the ricci flow on @xmath0 under the assumption that the flow is periodic on the boundary .<n> in particular , we prove the existence of non - smooth solutions to the following boundary value problem : for each finite simplicial complex @x to m$ ] , there is an open subset of the boundary @xcite such that for every smooth solution to this boundary value problems are absent . in this paper<n> we will show how to circumvent this difficulty and obtain a solution to the boundary problem that is smooth up to the edge . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the well - known existence of smooth solutions of the riemann problem for the geodesic flow on the plane . <n> the _ boundary value _ problem is the following : given a periodic solution to an inhomogeneous ricci equation on the real line , suppose that the boundary is given by the geodesics of the solution along the boundary of the complex . for a given set of boundary conditions on the solution<n> , one can ask whether it is possible to control the time evolution of its geodesic curvature . to this end , in this note we show that the geodesic curvature of a finite simplicial complex in @xmath0 can be estimated by a boundary integral .<n> more precisely , we prove that in the barrier sense , the time derivative of the right hand side of the boundary integral is bounded by exactly the desired term in the time - interval on which the ricci curvature is bounded . as a consequence<n> we obtain a lower bound on the distortion of the length of the geodesic curve . <n> the purpose of this note is to show that for a class of finite complex geometries @xcite , which includes the ones studied by the author @x<n> , there is an integral term bounded by the inverse of the distance from the center of the complex to the boundary of its faces such that for every smooth immersion there is a smooth one that is not differentiable . in this sense<n> the complex geometry is well - behaved . on the other hand ,<n> if we restrict our attention to simplicial complexes of higher dimension , then there are boundary integrals that can be obtained by a perturbation argument . for simplicity<n> we will only consider the case in which the complex is embedded in a euclidean space and the faces are denoted by @ in this note we prove a lemma on the evolution of the area of a surgery with precise cutoff in a ricci flow . <n> let @xmath0 be a finite simplicial complex .<n> we assume that the geodesic curvature of each immersion is bounded by a positive constant and that there is a precise cutoff defined on a time - interval that is interval in which the ricci curvature is bounded in the sense of area evolution . we prove that for every smooth family of immersions that are parameterized by time that extend the area defined by surgery times , there is an immersion that is smooth and that at every time that is uniformly bounded in geodesic curvature , i.e. that the volume of the space - time that contains the desired area is bounded from below by a constant that depends only on the desired volume . in this way we obtain the following lemma : [ lem : evolution of alambdaunderrf ] consider a family of smooth immersions of a finite stl complex @xcite that are bounded in area and that do nt meet any surgery points . for each immersion , consider a time interval that consists of time intervals that are on the same time -

markovian state , which is suddenly and unexpectedly coupled to an ohmic bath . using the bloch - redfield formalism and the born - markov approximation<n> we derive a master equation for the system . within this approach<n> we find that the qubit dynamics is determined by the redfield - bloch tensors , i.e. , by the time evolution of the system in the presence of dissipation . as an example we consider a qubit prepared in the stationary ground state of a nonlinear oscillator and subject to a sudden and strong coupling to the bath , such that the oscillator is prepared in its non - linear state . <n> quantum information processing ( qip ) relies on the generation and manipulation of non - classical states of light and matter @xcite . in order to achieve this task<n> it is essential to find ways to coherently manipulate and coherently prepare different quantum systems , e.g , atoms , ions , quantum dots , superconducting circuits , and quantum bits ( qubits ) . + we study the effect of nonlinearity and coupling on the entanglement of two -

+ - + + ++ + +<n> + + the study of dynamics of quantum systems is one of the most important topics in modern physics . due to the high complexity of these systems ,<n> in particular at low temperatures , it is very difficult to obtain analytical results . in the last years<n> a great progress has been achieved in the field of quantum information processing , e.g. , via the implementation of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols @xcite . for this reason , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the theoretical description of the dynamics , in particular we study the dynamics of a two - level system ( tls - no ) in a double - quantum - well potential .<n> the system is initially prepared in a non - equilibrium steady - state , which is characterized by a coherence @xmath0 . at low temperatures<n> we find that the coherence is enhanced by dephasing due to a relaxation mechanism . in the long - time limit<n> we derive an analytical expression for the relaxation rate and find that it is maximal at resonance , whereas it decays for detuning from resonance . <n> quantum coherence is a key ingredient for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite and quantum simulation of quantum many - body systems ( qbs ) . for a given qubit @x ,<n> the coherence of a qubit is the amount of information that can be extracted from it , i.e. , there is no coherence between the two qubits . on the other hand , in qbs<n> , the coherence can be increased by preparing the system in a state with a large amount of quantum correlations , such as a superposition of rydberg states , or by applying a proper potential , e.g we investigate the dynamics of a two - level system ( qubit ) in the presence of nonlinearity .<n> the resonance frequencies and the corresponding dephasing rates are determined by the bloch - siegert shift , which also influences the relative peak heights . by increasing the temperature<n> higher oscillator levels are populated and influence the qubit dynamics . <n> nonlinearity is one of the most fascinating properties of quantum systems @xcite . in quantum information processing<n> it is crucial to understand the influence of the relevant degrees of freedom on the dynamics , in particular on the long time dynamics of the system . for a qubit<n> the nonlinearity can be modeled by a hamiltonian @xmath0 , where , for example , the coupling constants are given by the lindblad equation , ( [ gl10a ] ) . here<n> we study the effect of the nonlinearities on the resonance and on the relaxation dynamics for a single - qubit system , modeled by the schrdinger equation ( lse ) @x<n> . the resonance frequency and the relaxation time of a single qubit can be related to the corresponding quantities for the linear and the nonlinear hamiltonians  we investigate the effect of nonlinearity on the dynamics of a two - level system ( tls ) coupled to a nonlinear oscillator within an ohmic spectral density .<n> we restrict ourselves to the regime of weak nonlinearity , weak damping and moderate coupling of oscillator and tl . to diagonalize the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator hamiltonian we used van vleck perturbation theory , hence avoiding the use of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . within the rwa and for vanishing nonlinearity<n> an analytical expression for the non - dissipative dynamics is given , which accounts for the infinite hilbert space of the composed system . + pacs numbers : 03.67.lx , 03.65.yz , 42.50.dv , 05.30.-d nonlinear dynamics is a rapidly growing field of research . in recent years<n> the nonlinear dynamics of qubits ( two level systems ) has attracted a lot of interest @xcite . a qubit is a two level quantum system ( qubit ) in the ground state which is coupled to an environment described by an energy spectrum which is non - equidistant : @xmath0 , @x we study the non - dissipative dynamics of a two - level system ( tls ) , which is weakly coupled to a nonlinear oscillator . to avoid the rotating wave approximation we diagonalize the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator hamiltonian in van vleck perturbation theory , hence avoiding the use of the rotating - wave approximation .<n> we restricted ourselves to the regime of weak nonlinearity , weak damping and moderate coupling of the nonlinear oscillator to an ohmic bath . in the linear case<n> we found a pronounced vacuum - rabi splitting of the dynamics . at low temperatures<n> this infinite hilbert space can be truncated such that the transition processes between the ground state and the two first excited energy levels of the qubits - non - oscillator system dominate the dynamics in contrast to the linear situation . as in the nonlinear case , this yields a pronounced rabi - splitting . <n> quantum information processing ( qip ) relies heavily on the interaction of a qubit with its surrounding environment . for this reason<n> the development of a solid - state qubit is one of the main goals of quantum information theory . among the candidate qubits<n> there are two types : superconducting qubits @xcite , we investigate the transformation properties of a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) in the presence of a gaussian white noise .<n> we show that the transformation matrix can be written as a sum of two terms , one of which is a purely nonlinear contribution , the other being a purely non - nonlinear contribution of the second order in the nonlinearity . using this transformation matrix<n> , we can derive the transformation rule for a given nl in terms of a transformation matrix of the form @xmath0 . <n> the transformation of a quantum state into a physical state is one of the most fundamental problems in quantum mechanics . in the classical theory of quantum mechanics<n> this transformation is given by the unitary transformation of the state into the physical state @xcite . for a unitary transformation to take place ,<n> the quantum state has to be prepared in a non - vanishing basis , which is itself a consequence of the hamiltonian structure of the system . as a consequence , for a quantum system the transformation<n> can not be carried out exactly , but it can be approximated by a linear transformation . on the other hand , in the case of a classical system , this linear transformation can be we present a theoretical study of the dipole - dipole interaction in a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms in the presence of a magnetic field .<n> we show that the interaction strength depends on the sign of the zeeman energy , and can be tuned by the field strength . in the case of a strong magnetic field<n> we find that the dipole interaction can be strongly suppressed , or even reversed , as the field is increased . <n> the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved , quantum phenomena are usually treated in a perturbative fashion . however , in many cases , such as in the quantum hall effect , perturbations can not be taken into account exactly . as a consequence ,<n> perturbations must be treated non -perturbatively in order to obtain the correct quantum states of a system . here , we study the interaction between a quantum system and a classical field in the framework of the linear response theory . we find a remarkable difference in the behavior of the system with respect to the classical field : the quantum field has a stronger effect on the system  we present a study of the angular momentum distribution of electrons in a double quantum dot ( dqd ) .<n> we focus on the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in the dot , which is responsible for the formation of a spin - polarized wave packet in the electron . using a non - perturbative approach<n> , we calculate the angular distribution of the electron wave packet , and show that it is strongly influenced by the so coupling . <n> double quantum dots ( dqrds ) are promising candidates for future spin qubits @xcite , due to their long coherence times , high spin polarizations and the possibility to control the spin state of the electrons by means of an external magnetic field . in recent years , a number of experiments have been carried out to measure the spin properties of double dqrs , using both conventional and non - conventional methods of electron beam characterization , such as time - of - flight ( tof ) spectroscopy , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xmath0  , mathcalo(alpha)$ ] we present a theoretical study of the optical absorption spectrum of monolayer graphene in the presence of an external electric field .<n> we show that the absorption spectrum is determined by the interplay between the evanescent modes of the graphene sheet and the thermal excitations in the surrounding medium . in the absence of an electric field<n> , the spectrum is found to be independent of the field strength , while for fields above a certain threshold , it becomes strongly dependent on the field direction . <n> graphene , a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has recently been the subject of intensive research @xcite due to its unique electronic , optical , and mechanical properties . at low temperatures ,<n> graphene exhibits a very narrow absorption spectrum @xmath0 , with a maximum value of about 1 ev at room temperature . on the other hand , at very high temperatures<n> the spectrum becomes broader and there is a corresponding increase in the effective mass of the carbon atoms , leading to the so - called mass gap@xcite . for graphene to be stable , however , this mass gap must be very small , of the order of 1 ev or less . to achieve this small mass gap  we investigate the optical properties of monolayer graphene by means of _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry calculations .<n> we find that the optical response of graphene depends strongly on the band gap , which is determined by the strength of the electron - phonon coupling . for a band gap of @xmath0 mev<n> , we predict a photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum with a sharp maximum at @ xmath1 , followed by a sharp drop of the pl intensity below this value . <n> graphene , a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its unusual electronic and optical properties @xcite . in particular , the high carrier mobility of graphene has led to the observation of a number of optical phenomena , such as the occurrence of sharp phonon peaks in the optical spectra of graphene monolayers ( mls)@xcite and graphene nanoribbons ( bnss ) , as well as the optical kerr effect in graphene microcavities@xmath2 , where the optical phonon mode of a ml is the phonon of a single layer of graphene . on the other hand ,<n> we calculate the dipole moment of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0rb atoms in the dipole - dipole interaction potential of a pair of optical dipole traps ( odts ) .<n> the dipole trap is composed of two one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical potentials , of which one is harmonic and the other is an harmonic oscillator . in the case of a 1d potential , we find that the bec oscillates with a frequency that is proportional to the amplitude of the harmonic one . for a 2d potential<n> , the oscillation frequency is determined by the amplitudes of both harmonics . <n> dipole traps @xcite are one of the most important non - adiabatic techniques for trapping ultracold atoms in optical dipole potentials and for simulating quantum many - body states of cold atoms . as a result ,<n> a large number of experiments have been performed using ultracold atomic beams and traps@xcite . however , it is still an open question whether these experiments are sensitive to the properties of the condensate or not. in this work<n> we study the behavior of a bec with respect to its interaction with an optical dipole trap . we we present the first measurement of the @xmath0-@xmath1 angular correlation function in a single - crystal carbon nanotube ( cnt ) .<n> the data were taken with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) at a cnt beamline at the cornell electron storage ring , where the cnt was formed in a carbon - oxygen ( co ) beamline . <n> we find that the angular correlations of the co beams are consistent with the previously reported rms angular correlation @xcite . however , we find a smaller rms correlation than reported in the literature , which we attribute to a systematic error in the stm measurements . in order to explain this discrepancy ,<n> we propose a model based on coulomb interaction between the electrons in the co nanotube and the effect of electron - electron repulsion , and we present our results in the framework of the non - linear sigma model . the measurement of angular correlations in single - crystalline carbon nanotubes ( scnnts ) is an important step towards the understanding of the fundamental properties of these systems . at present<n> , there is a large amount of experimental data available , showing the presence of short - range correlations @x we present a theoretical study of the dipole - dipole interaction in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0rb atoms in the presence of a magnetic field .<n> we find that the interaction strength depends strongly on the sign of the bec dipole moment , and that the dipole moment can be enhanced or suppressed by the field , depending on the nature of the interaction . <n> dipole - exchange interactions are fundamental to many quantum phenomena , including quantum teleportation , atom interferometry , atomic and molecular spectroscopy , quantum computation and quantum information processing . despite their importance ,<n> the fundamental nature of these interactions is still under debate . in this work<n> , we investigate the interaction of a bec with an external magnetic field in the framework of the non - equilibrium green s function formalism . for this purpose<n> we use the kubo formalism @xcite , which takes into account the interaction between the two becs , as well as the interaction with the field in its cross - section . we show that the field can be strongly modified by the exchange interaction , leading to a reduction of the strength of the coupling . as a result , the dipole we report on a measurement of the thermal conductivity @xmath0 of a carbon nanotube ( cnt ) by means of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .<n> the stm technique was used to perform a high - resolution , high - sensitivity measurement of a cnt superconducting tunnel junction ( stjst ) with a tunnel junction energy of @ xmath1 ev and an atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip with a tip - position angle ( ppa ) of @xcite . from the thermal conductance , we found that the junction is in the normal state with a temperature of t@xmath2 k , and the current - voltage characteristics of the junction are in good agreement with the predictions of the linear transport theory . <n> the measurement technique we used can be easily implemented in other superconducting tunnel junctions ( stts ) using stm and afm tip - positions as probes . as a result ,<n> the temperature and current characteristics of these junctions can be measured with high accuracy . in the past<n> , stms have been used to determine the transport properties of a variety of superconducting devices , such as superconducting junctions , superconducting niobium ( sn  we investigate the effect of the nonlinearity @xmath0 on the entanglement of two quantum states in a mixed state .<n> we consider the case of a separable mixed state in which the two states are separated by an energy barrier . in the linear approximation<n> we find that the entanglement is not affected by the nonlinearities , but is reduced when they are non - linear in the separability parameter . on the other hand , in the nonlinear case<n> the entanglement can be significantly affected by both nonlinearities and the barrier , and can even be completely destroyed . <n> quantum entanglement is an essential resource in quantum information processing and quantum communication @xcite . for a given quantum state<n> , there is an amount of information that can be extracted from this state , e.g. , by measuring the state of a physical system , or by performing a measurement on it . however , the amount of entanglement that a quantum system can generate depends on the state that it is prepared in , as shown in fig . [ fig : separ](a ) , where the state is defined as the maximally entangled state of the system in the state space , denoted by @x we present a method for the calculation of the photon - assisted decay rate @xmath0 of ultracold atoms .<n> the method is based on the solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation in the framework of the density matrix renormalization group . in this way<n> , we are able to calculate the decay rate in the whole range of the experimentally accessible parameter space . <n> pacs number(s ) : 42.50.pq , 03.65.vf , 32.80.pj , 05.30.fk , 42.55.ah , 12.20.ds quantum computation and quantum information have been the focus of intense research activity in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally . the development of quantum algorithms @xcite , together with the advent of state - of - the - art experimental techniques , has resulted in an impressive progress in the field of quantum information processing . however , it has not yet been possible to fully exploit the potential of quantum computers to solve certain types of computational tasks , such as factoring , entanglement distribution , and quantum teleportation , which have been demonstrated to be particularly challenging in the context of quantum computation we present the results of a calculation of the nuclear stopping power @xmath0 of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .<n> the calculation is performed in the framework of the perturbative qcd approach . <n> nuclear stopping is one of the most important observables in relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments . in this study<n> we focus on the investigation of the stopping power of ultrarelativistic heavy ions at lhc and rhic energies @xcite . to this end , we perform a calculation in the nonperturbative regime of qcd , using the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach to the equation of state ( eos ) of the collisional matter . here<n> we present results for the total stopping power as a function of the relativistic energy , obtained by solving the eos in the rmf formalism . as a result ,<n> we find that the value of the nlo nlo correction to the total stopped power is rather small , of the order of a few percent , but it is of the same order of magnitude as the value obtained from the gaussian ansatz , i.e we present a study of the interaction between a pair of @xmath0rb atoms and a single photon in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .<n> the interaction is mediated by the exchange of photons between the two atoms , which is described by the weinberg - salam ( ws ) photon - photon ( p - p ) potential . in the nonrelativistic regime<n> , we find that the energy of the emitted photon depends on the relative momentum of the two electrons in the system . as a result ,<n> the energy difference between the photon and the lowest lying excited state of the system can be large enough to change the sign of the rabi oscillations in the ws potential , but does not change the wave function of the excited state . <n> pacs numbers : : 03.70.+k , 03.65.bz , 12.20.ds , 14.20.dh in recent years , qed has attracted a lot of interest due to the possibility to study strongly correlated systems at the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from the relativistic to the non - relativistic regime @xcite . among the we present a calculation of the photon emission spectrum of @xmath0c , @ xmath1c and c@xmath2o in the energy range from threshold to 100 mev .<n> we show that the spectrum is strongly dependent on the experimental parameters , and in particular , that the energy of the emitted photon can be larger or smaller than the inverse photon energy , depending on the optical depth of the probe . <n> pacs numbers : 41.60.ap , 41.75.ht , 42.65.ky , 12.20.ds the study of the properties of light emitting diodes ( leps ) is one of the most important topics in the field of high - power , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy @xcite . in recent years<n> , several experiments have been carried out , mainly at philips , but also at chandrasekhar and at gsi , aiming to detect the emission of photons with energies from a few tens of mev up to a few gev , as well as the detection of the excited states of the lep nuclei . the main goal of these experiments is to obtain information on the properties we study the effect of the interaction of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with the electromagnetic field on the dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) at rhic and lhc energies .<n> in particular , we focus on the interaction between the perturbative and nonperturbative part of the qgp energy spectrum . we find that , in general , the energy spectrum of the collision of two heavy ions is modified in a non - trivial way . as a result ,<n> the total cross section of the reaction increases , as well as the rapidity distribution of the final state particles . <n> relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) is one of the most challenging problems of modern physics , since it is characterized by an extremely high cross section ( @xmath0 @xcite ) , high rate of occurrence of relativistic particles , and the need to fully resolve the collision zone in order to achieve the preservation of the initial state of the matter . in rhic<n> , it is expected that up to 100 pb@xmath1 of incident energy will be converted into the kinetic energy of the projectile , which leads to a very high we present a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculation of the ground and excited states of the spin-1 @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet .<n> the calculation is performed in the framework of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the wave function of the system . <n> we find that the calculated energy spectrum is in good agreement with the experimental value for the ground state , but the calculated excited state energies are significantly larger than the experimental values . in the case of the excited states ,<n> the calculated wave function is in better agreement with experiment than the one obtained in the previous calculations based on the conventional lda+lda+@xmath1 wave function , which is valid only for a restricted range of energies of the two excited states and only for vanishing internuclear separation , i.e. , no magnetic moment is required . the calculation of excited states is one of the most important problems in the study of quantum magnetism , as it is closely related to the experimental determination of the magnetic ground state @xcite , and also to the search for exotic states of matter , such as we study the dynamics of a quantum degenerate bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the bloch - redfield approximation ( fsa ) at low temperature .<n> we find that the bec undergoes a first order phase transition into a coherent superposition of two condensates , each with a different temperature , density , and chemical potential . <n> quantum degenerate bec has attracted a lot of attention during the past few years @xcite . in this system ,<n> the two components of the condensates are incoherent due to the competition between their internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , the bosons and the fermions , which leads to the formation of a condensate - fermion condensate ( fsc ) pair , as well as a condensate with bosonic and fermionic impurities , called bosonic fsc ( b - fs ) . due to this competition<n> , a fsc can be formed even in the absence of an external magnetic field , if the system is cooled down sufficiently far from its ground state , where the degeneracy of the bosonic condensates is lifted , so that the system can be described by we report on the experimental realization of a two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 modes confined to the two sides of a parabolic trap .<n> the bec was prepared by using a self - flux technique , and the condensate was observed to be in a quasi -

vanishing probability distribution for the number of atoms in the initial state . in the presence of dissipation<n> , we find that the probability distribution is modified and acquires a nontrivial form , that depends on the strength of the coupling between the atom and the field , as well as on the nature of the initial - state interaction . <n> the study of the time evolution of quantum systems is one of the oldest and most important topics in modern physics . since the seminal works of blum and louisell @xcite , a great deal of work has been done on this subject , both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . however , it is only in the last few years that the theoretical studies of quantum dissipation have become an active area of research , due to the advent of new experimental techniques and the development of new theoretical approaches @",

[ [ section ] ] since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , the search for new particles in the standard model ( sm ) has been one of the main topics of the lhc experiments , with much of the attention being focussed on the  electro we present the most recent results on the production of the z boson in proton - proton collisions at @xmath0 = 1.96 tev at the fermilab tevatron collider , using the full data sample collected during the 2010 and 2011 running periods .<n> measurements of the boson _ z _ transverse momentum , as well as the boson rapidity , transverse momentum and invariant mass are presented in the muon , tau , eta and eta+jet channels . <n> address = department of physics and astronomy , university of southampton , southampton so17 1bj , united kingdom the tevatron runs i and ii have produced a wealth of new data , providing new insights into the structure of the _ z _ and the underlying event .<n> we present analyses of jet production in _<n> z__+3 jets and drell - yan events at @xmath0 = 2 , 3 , and 7 tev , with particular emphasis on comparing the jets recoiling against the z to the jets produced in the hard interaction . in addition , we constrain the model of the multi parton interaction ( mpi ) in @xcite , which has been proposed as a possible explanation for the s - wave jets . <n> we also present the results of a study of underlying event ( ue ) analysis , in which we look at the source of hadronic activity , the parton fragmentation functions ( pdfs ) of the hadrons , as well as the mpi model in the two different monte - carlo generators used , namely , that of the opal and pythia groups . we study the impact of matrix element correction ( me ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath0 and @xcite monte carlo generators on the description of _ z _ ( + jets ) events at the fermilab tevatron collider .<n> we find that the nlo matrix elements do not significantly change the underlying event description , but do affect the prediction of the cross sections and the transverse momentum distributions of the jets . we present a study of the impact of matrix elements of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) monte carlo generators on the production of _ z _ ( + jets ) in data , @xmath0 , cdf , d0 and lhcb .<n> we find that the nlo matrix elements have a slight impact on the prediction of the differential cross section , but do not significantly change the transverse momentum or rapidity distributions . <n> [ cols=\",,options=\"header \" , ] ( 0,0 ) ( 340,205)utpt-97 - 03 ( 335,210)hep - ph/9702287 * impact of nlo generators on + jets production at the tevatron * * dae - gyu lee@xmath1 , sang - jin sin@xcite , ismail zahed@x.1 cm , yeon - yong kim@xxmath2 , da - neng gao@x<n> .6 cm _<n> @xcite the study of jet multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions at hadron colliders is an important test of the standard model ( we present the d0 and d0 _ z _ analyses on jet transverse momentum and cross section in @xmath0 , and compare the predictions with the data .<n> we also present the predictions for the cross section of _<n> z_+3 jets production at nlo ( powheg formalism ) and at lo ( me correction on ) . <n> the tevatron experiments have measured with unprecedented precision the production of z bosons in proton - antiproton collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev @xcite . here<n> we report the results of the analysis of the data collected by the d and the zeus detectors at the fermilab _ l_@xmath1 collider . in the context of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics ,<n> the z boson is one of the most important particles , both theoretically and experimentally , because of its crucial role in the quark and gluon structure of the universe , as well as in determining the masses of the fermions . at low values of the sm mass scale , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @x we present a study of the production of the _ z _ boson and jet recoil in @xmath0 collisions at the fermilab tevatron .<n> we use jet transverse momentum distributions from the cdf collaboration , data from the d0 collaboration and event generators pythia , phoebe , and phob , as well as next - to - leading order perturbative qcd predictions . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we present an analysis of the transverse momentum distribution of jets and the recoil of jets produced in the collision of two oppositely charged fermions at the tev energy @xcite . in this analysis , we use data from cdf , d0 and phoebe to subtract the leading jet contribution from the total cross section , in order to obtain a more precise measurement of the boson production cross section and of the jet recoil . to this end ,<n> we have used jet transverse momenta from the data of the d1 and d0 collaborations , combined with event generators phob and pythia [ fig . [  fig.1 ] ] and a jet recoil matrix element from d0 , @x we present a study of the production of the _ z _ boson in proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the monte carlo generators @xmath0 , with its standard model ( mc ) input parameters , and the updated _<n> z , _ with next -

7 tev<n> , the comparison shows that the behaviour of the two generators is different in different kinematic regions . <n> one of the main goals of the lhcb experiment is the study of the production of the z boson , that is the  missing link '' of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .<n> the production cross section is expected to be large enough to allow the detection of this boson . at the same time ,<n> if not detected , it would be a clear signal of new physics , such as supersymmetry , grand unification , extra dimensions , etc . the standard - model ( sm ) of electroweak physics ( ewp ) predicts the existence of a  z '' boson : a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) that decay the measurement of the production of the _ z _ boson in proton - proton collisions at the lhc and at the tevatron is presented .<n> the monte carlo generators @xmath0 , which give the cross sections up to infinite orders of qcd , and the mpi , that gives the matrix elements up to next - to - leading order , both give results that agree with the measured cross sections , in particular in the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the final state particles . <n> the extraction of the mass and the transverse momentum of the z boson from its decay into a bottom quark and an anti - quark is an important test of the standard model ( sm ) and of its extensions . in the early phase of lhc running ,<n> the production cross section and the properties of the particles produced in collisions of two protons at the center - of - mass energy of 7 tev were measured with a data set of integrated luminosities of up to 1.96 pb@xmath1 @xcite . at the end of the first data taking period<n> , the total integrated luminosity was measured to be 17.9 fb@xcite<n> . we perform a detailed study of @xmath0 _ _ z _ production at the lhc ( 7 tev ) and the tevatron ( 7 and 7 tesla ) energies within the perturbative qcd factorization approach ( pqcd ) .<n> we consider the production in the electron and muon channels , and the invariant mass distribution in the muon channel for the first time at a hadron collider . <n> our study is based on the monte carlo event generator , metropolis , which includes the full jet energy distribution , including the full transverse momentum distribution of the jets . for both the energy and the channel ,<n> we compare the results with mpi ( molecular dynamics ) simulation . in the case of lhc<n> , we find that , for the electron ( muon ) production , the mpi results are in good agreement with the experimental data , while for the muonic ( electron ) case we observe a slight overestimation of the total cross section due to the finite transverse momentum of the leading jets , especially for the large values of the transverse momenta of the electrons . with the first data we perform a detailed study of the production of the trilepton @xmath0 in the electron channel at the lhc and the tevatron .<n> we consider both next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions and next - leading - order ( nnlo)@xmath1 qcd predictions . in both cases<n> we use the monte - carlo event generator monte carlo ( mpi ) and the parton cascade model ( pcm ) with the glauber event generator ( gcm ) to calculate the cross sections and the transverse momenta of the produced particles . <n> the calculation of the total cross sections for the electron and photon channels is performed for the first time at a hadron collider ( lhc , 7 tev ) using the mpi and pcm codes , respectively . for the photon channel<n> we find that the perturbativity of the qcd gluon density is essential for a good description of the cross section , and that the nlo prediction is in good agreement with the experimental data , while the npqcd prediction is slightly too low . we present the results of the analysis of _ z _ production in hadron colliders performed in the d0 analysis .<n> we studied the influence of adding a next to leading order term in the monte carlo simulation for _<n> z_-boson production . in the @xmath0 formalism<n> , it was seen that the use of the nlo term , studied here in @xcite , improves the prediction of the cross sections of the processes , as well as the behaviour of the physics observables , specially in the region of higher transverse momentum . the implementation of the matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism also improves the description of the data in the high transverse momentum region , compared to the calculations in leading order without the correction . <n> we also performed the analysis in the muon channel , and we could see that there is a systematic behaviour lower than the tevatron data in mid - range transverse momentum of the _z _ boson . we compare the monte carlo predictions for @xmath0 _ _ z__+@xmath1 and @xcite , for the tevatron and lhc first run energies ( 7 tev ) , and show that the implementation of the matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism improves the prediction of the cross sections of the processes , as well as the behaviour of the physics observables , specially in the region of higher transverse momentum .<n> it was also seen that both @x<n> . <n> nlo and d0 analysis show a systematic behaviour lower than the sevatron data in the mid - range transverse momentum of the _z _ boson , compared to the calculations in leading order without the correction . we present a study of the _ z _ boson production in @xmath0 , and , for a more fundamental check of balance , in both mc generators , with the sum of the transverse momentum of all particles found in the event .<n> we perform a study to isolate the different effects of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) and hard scatters . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] the tevatron @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern have measured many properties of the bosonic parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which are related to the parton densities at the quark level . in particular , the pdfs of the partons in the proton and the hadrons have been measured , as well as those of the gluons and quarks in the qcd ( qcd ) sector . with the data , it is not possible to isolate all the effects of mpi and hard scatterings , or extend them below the cuts used in analysis . as a result ,<n> it is difficult to isolate them , but it is possible to perform some studies to we present an analysis of the di - electron invariant mass distribution from @xmath0 and @xcite , with the aim of constraining the contribution of the higgs boson to the gluon density in the universe .<n> the analysis is performed in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , which contains a higgs field in addition to the sneutrino and slepton . in this framework ,<n> the gluons couple to the photons of the qcd vacuum , and the contribution from higgs production is suppressed as the photon flux is increased . as a result<n> , we find that the standard deviation of the resulting gluon distribution is consistent with zero , within the uncertainties , at the level of 0.7% . <n> the study of di - electroweak processes at hadron colliders ( hics ) is an important tool in the quest for the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( e.g. , supersymmetry ) and in the determination of the fundamental constants of nature . at the tevatron and lhc , di - leptons are produced in the decays of top quarks multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) are studied in the context of the drell yan production .<n> it is shown that , in the balance , the mpi model with @xmath0 , @ x@xmath1 , _ _ z _ @xcite , and @x_xmath2 _ has a reasonable description for the production of the jets , but it disagrees with that of the ue model , especially in the lower jet region . <n> [ cols= \"  \" ,<n> ] in the last years , a lot of mpi models have been proposed , such as the multiplet model ( mmm ) , mmm@xcite and the wmsm , as well as the wsm+wmssm model . in this note , we will show that mpi is not a good model for drell - yan ( dy ) production , because it leads to too large production of jets . on the other hand<n> , it is possible to have a good description for both the leading jet and the sum of jets ( s / n ) we study the influence of the mpi model on the analysis of the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of _ z _ events at the tevatron and rhic .<n> we also compare the results with those obtained from the analysis without mpi . <n> one of the interesting features of the rhic physics program is the study of the process : @xmath0 , which has been proposed as a probe for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in particular , it is interesting to see whether , in addition to the sm contributions , one can extract new physics contributions from the non - sm processes . to this end<n> , we have performed a series of monte - carlo simulations of the processes : _<n> z_@xmath1 , _ s_++ - rm gev$ ] , and _ d_-rm t   -rm z ) , with the monte carlo event generators pythia and phoebe , as implemented in the cdf and d0 detectors . here<n> we present the results of these we perform a monte - carlo study of the mpi model in the sherpa event generators , and compare the results with the tevatron data .<n> we find that mpi significantly changes the shape of boson transverse momentum distribution in the low @xmath0 region , which is very sensitive to mpi . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the last two years , the cdf and d0 collaborations have published many measurements of particle production in proton - proton collisions at tev energies @xcite . among these measurements ,<n> one of the most interesting is the transverse momentum ( tm ) distribution of the drell - yan ( dy ) pairs in the z - boson mass region . at low transverse momenta , these dy pairs have a very broad transverse distribution , while at high transverse momentas , they have a narrow distribution . in order to understand the origin of these distributions , it is necessary to consider the production mechanisms of the produced particles , such as gluon - gluon plasma ( ggp ) , heavy quark - anti - quark plasma ( hhqp ) and the d0 experiment at the fermilab tevatron collider has measured the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charged pion , kaon , eta , and z bosons produced in p - p collisions at @xmath0 tev .<n> the measurements were performed in the proton anti - proton system at s**(1/2 ) = 1.96-tev using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 110.2 pb@xmath1 collected at the experiment s center - of - mass energy in the period from 2008 to 2010 . <n> the results are compared with expectations based on pqcd parton distribution functions , parton energy loss models and perturbative qcd predictions . in the standard model ,<n> the pion and eta rapidity distributions are proportional to each other , while the boson rapidity distribution is proportional to the product of the transverse momenta of the particles . for the bosons , however , the ratio of the boson and the transverse momentum of the produced particle is different in the three collision systems , indicating that the boson production is affected by the impact - parameter dependence of the parton density in the nuclear medium . the d",

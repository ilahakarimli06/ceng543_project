day universe . due to the high energy density of the dark radiation ,<n> its effect on the cmb can be quite small , however , since its effect is suppressed by the fact that most of the energy density is in the form of neutrinos which do not interact with ordinary matter ( e.g. , neutrinos , antineutrinos inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) are sensitive to the thermal history of the universe .<n> thus they can be used to probe the history of inflation . in this paper<n> , we calculate the spectrum of the inflationary gw , taking account of the effects of anisotropic stress , and discuss its basic features . <n> inflation is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , because it can naturally account for the currently observed cosmological parameters , such as the hubble constant @xmath0 , the amplitude of gravitational waves , as well as the cmb anisotropy and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) . among the extensions ,<n> the simplest one is the so -

baryonic , which means that its equation of state ( eos ) should not be baryon - rich ( @xmath0 ) , leptonic or photon - rich , since these eos are required to explain the current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) we study the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) process in which a small lepton is produced and then decays into visible radiation .<n> we assume that the small - lepton ( @xmath0 ) is produced at some time or has existed from the beginning , and that the decay rate of the small particle is suppressed by the initial ratio of the mass to the light quark mass . in this case , we find that the energy density carried by the small leptons in a comoving volume is proportional to the product of the ( small ) lepton mass and the ( large ) energy density at the time of the production . <n> _ introduction. _ the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite and the subsequent establishment of lepton number ( ng ) conservation laws have been some of the most important developments in particle physics during the past two decades . among many other things ,<n> neutrino oscillation experiments have played a key role in establishing ng as a fundamental law of nature @x<n> . however , the origin of the ng is still an open question . here<n> we study a different possibility , namely that the leptons are produced by the decay of a small we study the gravitational lensing ( gw ) by dark matter , motivated by models of particle physics . we find that the spectrum of the gw is insensitive to the details of the particle physics underlying the models .<n> thus , gw may be used as a probe of the underlying physics , independent of the specific model . <n> the gravitational ( gravitation ) lensing effect is one of the most striking manifestations of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe . in the standard picture of dm<n> , it is caused by the gravitational attraction between dark ( baryonic ) matter and dark ( anti - dark ) radiation , which are described by the hubble expansion rate @xmath0 , and the cosmological constant , the amplitude of which is inversely proportional to the energy density of the dark radiation @xcite . however ,<n> recent observations indicate that our universe is dominated by an invisible sector which is composed of non - interacting massive particles , weakly interacting massive ones ( wimps ) and ordinary matter . for a long time<n> it has been believed that the invisible sector does not dominate the universe and that wimps and anti - wimps are not important  we study the gravitational wave ( gw ) signals from the redshift @xmath0 after the epoch of recombination ( rd ) , the minimal dark energy ( md ) epoch , and the reionization ( rm ) era . we find that the spectrum of gws from the rd epoch to the md epoch is suppressed due to the presence of dark radiation . on the other hand , due to a brief period of thermal inflation which is caused by a scalar field , there is a steep change of the spectrum for gw with the wavenumber around 0.5 at the horizon after the decoupling of the thermal bath . <n> _ introduction_.@xmath1 recently , it has been suggested that the primordial universe may have a non - vanishing gravitational wave background .<n> this is called the gw background @xcite . in this letter<n> , we will show the case in which gravitational waves are produced in the process of recombination , minimal and non - minimal energy - transfer epochs ( the md , rd and md epochs ) and also in the non - interacting dark radiation which dominates the universe . here ,<n> we assume that the massive particle which recent observations of gravitational waves ( gws ) indicate that our universe is spatially flat .<n> we show that the flatness can be explained by a phase transition of a scalar field from a relativistic to a non - relativistic phase in the early universe . in the late universe ,<n> the late - time entropy production by massive particles makes the anisotropic stress in the horizon weaker and suppresses the gw frequencies . as a result<n> , we find a gw frequency of @xmath0 at decoupling , which is consistent with recent observations by the _ planck _<n> satellite . <n> gravitational waves are a powerful tool to study the early and late universe @xcite . the spectrum of the gravitational wave background is determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of the primordial universe and can be used to constrain the properties of dark energy , the dominant component of the universe in the present epoch , by using the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the large scale structure ( lss , see the review by keisuke yamamoto in this volume ) . however , in order to explain the recent observations , it is important to understand we consider the possibility that a phase transition in high energy physics is triggered by a coherent oscillation .<n> we show that the phase transition is characterized by anisotropic stress and entropy injection . in the case of a short period of thermal inflation<n> , the horizon entry due to the coherent - oscillation domination is twice due to thermal inflation , and the resulting gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum shows oscillatory behavior with its amplitude proportional to the transition frequency between the two regimes . for the modes which experience the second horizon entry twice ,<n> the amplitude of the gw spectrum is proportional to @xmath0 . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) icrr -

zero . <n> recently , we proposed a new class of gravity theories in which the cosmological constant is not a constant but a dynamical variable with a positive pressure @xcite . among them , quintuple field gravity ( qf ) models @x , which are characterized by the following properties : ( i ) scalar field , ( ii ) effective equation - of - state ( eos ) and ( iii ) dark energy , are described by the qf of qf models ; ( iv ) the eos and the pressure can be positive and negative , respectively ; and ( v ) there is a continuous phase transition from a radiation - dominated we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be expressed as the sum of adiabatic and isocurvature terms .<n> the former is proportional to the energy density of the universe while the latter gives the eos of dark energy in the early universe . as a result ,<n> we obtain the eo@xmath1 limit which is consistent with the recent result of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) collaboration . <n> dark energy ( de ) is one of the most attractive candidates for explaining the origin of the observed large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe , together with dark matter ( dm ) and baryons . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , dark energy is described by a cosmological constant @xcite , and it is believed to be the dominant component of the energy content of our universe at the present epoch . however , recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by the wmap collaboration indicate that the present universe is spatially flat and dark energy has a non - vanishing component , which is referred to as the  motivated by the recent result of the muon @xmath0 anomaly , we study the radiative muon decays of a light pseudoscalar higgs boson . we find that the branching ratios of the decays are suppressed due to the one - loop effect of a pseudoscalar higgs field . as a result ,<n> the branching ratio of the @xcite muon channel is enhanced by a factor of two , compared with that in the previous analysis .<n> we also show that the cp - violating branching ratio for the muonic decay of the higgs is suppressed in the case of a non - abelian gauge group . <n> recently , the observation of a muon anomalously large branching ratio ( a@xmath1 ) by the experiment e821@xcite has attracted a lot of attention not only from the theoretical side but also from the experimental one . in the context of supersymmetry ( susy ) , one of the most important issues is to find out whether the sm particles are light enough to have masses above the tev scale . to achieve this goal , many models have been proposed . among them<n> , supersymmetric models @x unified theories with a single right - handed neutrino ( @xmath0 ) in the mass eigenstate are consistent with the observed abundance of baryons and antibaryons in the universe .<n> we show that , in the context of supersymmetric theories , the mass of the right - hand neutrino is constrained by the requirement that the lightest neutrino in the theory should have a mass smaller than the lightest neutralino , thus providing a natural solution to the strong cp problem of neutrino oscillations . <n> baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bec ) , observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , is a direct indication of the existence of neutrinos . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , neutrinos<n> are massless and interact with each other only through the exchange of a single charged lepton @xcite . within the framework of supersymmetry ( susy )<n> , there is a natural mechanism to break the susy symmetry in the neutrino sector , i.e. , via the yukawa couplings to the left - handed ( r - parity - violating ) neutrinos @x<n> . however , this mechanism we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) can be expressed in terms of a single parameter @xmath0 , which is determined by the coupling constants of the dark matter ( dm ) to ordinary matter and baryons .<n> we find that the eos in the simplest supersymmetric ( susy ) models with the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is constrained to be very small by the recent dama and cogent results . <n> one of the most interesting problems in cosmology is that of the origin of the energy density in the universe . in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) ,<n> energy density is given by the kinetic energy of the particles , while in susy models , it is generally assumed that energy is generated by the interaction between the sm particles and the electromagnetic fields of the universe @xcite . on the other hand , in the minimal susy model of supersymmetry ( sugra )<n> , there is a possibility of supersymmetric particles interacting with the sm fields , so that they can be described by the so - called supersymmetric model ( ssmm ) with the following properties : @x we propose a supersymmetric @xmath0-triplet gauge model with a higgs - triplet higgs boson and a singlet fermion .<n> the higgs field is assumed to be massless , while the fermions are heavy . in this model ,<n> the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a triplet gauge boson , and the masses of the supersymmetric particles and the singlets are determined by the vacuum expectation values of the gauge bosons . as a result , the model predicts a mass hierarchy between the lightest and the heavier triplet lsps . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , due to the possibility of new physics beyond the sm , such as supersymmetry breaking ( smb ) and grand unification ( gut ) in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein )<n> . however , it is not clear how the sm can be realized without introducing new physics . the simplest and most natural way",

called copula estimation , in which one estimates the density by a kernel density estimator , which is then transformed into the domain of interest . the copula approach , first proposed by gauss in the 1950 s , is based on the idea that the density should be estimated by a product of two univariate gaussian kernels , one for each data point , where we present improved probit -

known spin - boson model , while in the strong - coupling regime , it is shown to give rise to a novel spin - liquid phase . <n> _ introduction : _ the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the major challenges of modern physics . due to the complexity of the problem ,<n> it is often necessary to resort to approximations , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite , or to ideas from quantum information theory , like the derivation of the wigner - seitz transformation ( wtt ) of the wave function of a composite system . for in this paper , we introduce a new model for the transfer of angular momentum between two parallel plates in contact with a heat bath .<n> we show that the transfer matrix can be expressed in terms of kummer confluent hypergeometric functions . using this model ,<n> we investigate the transfer properties of the two - dimensional lennard - jones fluid . in the limit of high viscosity<n> , this model reduces to a one - dimensional hydrodynamic equation . for low viscosity , it is possible to solve this equation exactly . <n> pacs numbers : 05.20.dd , 05.45.pq , 47.54.+r in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the problem of transfer of energy from one fluid to another @xcite . as a result of this interest , a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of transfer in hydrodynamic systems , both in equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium ( see , e.g. , refs . 1 , 2 and 4 for recent reviews ) . among the models that have been applied to this problem , one of the best known is the one introduced by saffman we show that a bardeen - type potential can be used to control the propagation of the spectrum of a single mode of a quantum system .<n> this is achieved by means of a finite bounce in the transfer matrix of the system , caused by the interaction of the mode with the potential . <n> [ [ introduction.- ] ] introduction .- + + ++ + + - + +<n> + + the study of wave propagation in potentials is one of the cornerstones of modern physics . in this context , the concept of a potential ,<n> i.e. a potential which can be written as the sum of two parts , is very appealing : the potential @xmath0 , which describes the wave function , propagates with the same speed as the velocity of light , @xcite . as a result<n> , a great deal of attention has been devoted to potentials having a definite spectrum , such as bardeen s , dirac s and delta - function potentials . among the latter , potentials with definite spectrum are of particular interest , because they can be employed to model systems such as atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs we show that a bounce in the spectrum of an atom interacting with a short - range potential of the form @xmath0 leads to a finite renormalization of the spectrum .<n> the amplitude of the renormalized spectrum depends on the strength of the interaction and is finite in the thermodynamic limit . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.ge , 05.45.pq , 42.50.ct , 32.80.pj in recent years , there has been an explosion of interest in the physics of atom - atom interactions @xcite . in particular , it has been realized that the interaction of a single atom with a background field can be described by a schrdinger equation ( sde ) , which can in some cases be cast as a potential , and in other cases by a wave equation ( weinberg ) with an effective potential . as a result ,<n> a variety of interesting phenomena have been observed , including the decoupling of a quantum system from its environment , the de broglie - bohm oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of an external magnetic field , as well as the formation of a  we present a systematic study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of a driven quantum system in the presence of a dissipative environment .<n> we show that the dynamics can be described in terms of an effective hamiltonian , _ _ i.e. _ a set of equations of motion in the reduced hilbert space , which are obtained by solving a generalized schrdinger equation ( eq . <n> ( [ thm ] ) ) in the case of an isolated two - level system in contact with a thermal bath . in this context<n> , we find that , in the thermodynamic limit , the dynamics is invariant under time reversal invariant transformations of the system s parameters , and that time reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the system under consideration , even when the system is far away from equilibrium . we also find that the time - reversal symmetry is broken even in the stationary regime , when the bath is initially prepared in a non - interacting many - body state , provided that the initial state is not a superposition of the ground state and the bath s eigenstates @xmath0 the dynamics of an open quantum system driven by an external potential @x the propagation of cosmological perturbations through a general relativistic bounce is studied in the case of a square root form for the scale factor .<n> it is shown that the curvature of the bounce is responsible for the divergence of the perturbation potential at some points , providing a first hint that one approach the bounce or as one approaches it , ceases to be the good quantum variable to work with . the spectrum of tensor modes and a comparison with other known transitions in cosmology<n> are also discussed . <n> it has been known for some time that the universe undergoes a transition from a radiation - dominated to a cosmological - constant - dominated phase @xcite . in the latter phase ,<n> the universe is filled with a large amount of cold dark matter ( dm ) , and the evolution of the dm is determined by the energy density in the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium ( igm ) at the time of the transition , which is called the cosmological bounce . at that time , the igm was in a vacuum state , with a small but non - zero curvature , as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) in the early universe . since then , gr has been gradually being modified , leading to a particle creation and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) interactions are considered in the context of quantum chaos .<n> it is shown that , in the case of @xmath0 particles , the bcs interaction and the bardeen potential can not be expressed in terms of canonically quantized operators . instead , canonical quantization is required in order to derive the effective action . in this case<n> , it is also shown that the effective velocity of sound diverges at the bounce and that this divergence is related to the time at which the divergences occur . <n> quantum chaos has been a subject of intense interest since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . since then , both theoretical and experimental aspects of the phenomenon have been the subject of intensive studies . at present , there is a great deal of interest in the study of the effect of chaos on the properties of matter , _<n> e.g. _ in condensed matter physics , statistical mechanics of elementary particles and the dynamics of vortices in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , to name only a few . from a theoretical point of view , one of the most important we present a new solution to the einstein - de sitter - salam problem in which the expansion of the universe is followed by the production of gravitational waves during the bounce .<n> the solution is free from singularities in the expansion history and does not violate the naturalness condition ( nec ) , thus leading to a bouncing era in which tensorial perturbations are not produced , and scalar modes are never affected , regardless of the underlying parameter values . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is based on the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time ( i.e. , a @xmath0cdm universe ) with a positive cosmological constant . in order to reconcile the predictions of the sm with observations ,<n> it is necessary to introduce some additional assumptions , such as the existence of a curvature singularity at the planck scale @xcite , or , alternatively , the presence of a vacuum energy , in the form of a negative cosmological constant ( cc)@xmath1 . among the latter<n> , one of the most appealing is that of a cosmological bounce , where the universe undergoes a transition from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated era we study the evolution of the gravitational potential in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe filled with a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath0 .<n> we show that , if the universe is initially homogeneous and isotropic , there is a smooth transition from a radiation - dominated phase to a phase of matter domination . in the radiation dominated phase ,<n> the potential for the bardeen graviton changes during the transition , but only insofar as the amplitude is concerned , leaving its spectrum unaltered . when only one field is present , the potentials for either of the variables are essentially undistinguishable and both coincide numerically with the inverse hubble size . <n> cosmology is one of the oldest , yet youngest fields of physics , and its most successful theoretical model is that of inflationary expansion followed by a period of radiation domination ( _ i.e. _ , a cosmological bounce ) @xcite . during this period of inflation , gravitons acquire a mass , which , however , is small compared to their vacuum expectation value . as a consequence , inflation is adiabatic and we study the evolution of the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations as they propagate across a bouncing universe . we show that the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations and that the potential @xmath0 is the quantity that matters in this context , in contrast with the inflationary paradigm for which the potentials are almost the same as at the relevant times .<n> we also show that for more than one field , the situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 04.50.+h , 95.35.+d the standard model of particle physics predicts the existence of an extra degree of freedom in the form of a massive fermion field @xcite . for a given wave number ,<n> the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , which is often phrased as  horizon exit '' , and the phrase  hubble crossing '' is used to refer to the crossing of the horizon . in the context of the early universe , however , this is not the case and the situation can be qualitatively different from what happens during inflation , at least in the region of we propose a new mechanism for the transition from an expanding to a contracting phase in a semi - classical field theory .<n> the mechanism is based on the fact that , in the early stages of the universe evolution , the scalar field acquires a non - vanishing kinetic energy in the contracting phase , which is followed by a bounce . in this way<n> , one obtains a mechanism for which the transition is compatible with the non - causal structure of the standard model ( nec ) , while at the same time being consistent with causality and the nec preservation . as an example , we show that this mechanism can lead to a spectral correction at the bounce if the bounce lasts less than the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with nec conservation , thus providing a counter - example to the claim that bounce transitions do not affect large scales of perturbations . <n> one of the main motivations for the study of the early universe was the hope of finding an explanation for the origin of the observed large scale structure , as well as for elucidating the nature of gravity itself @xcite . to this end , a number of models have been proposed in the literature , among which are inflation , scalar - tensor bouncing models of the universe require a high curvature phase in order for the gravitational wave spectrum to be unaffected .<n> this phase is followed by an unknown epoch which connects to the bounce itself , which should also be followed by yet another unknown epoch in order that the curvature to be negligible @xcite . in this short note<n> , we summarize the main results obtained in refs . <n> [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , in the context of the construction of a bouncing universe . in this paper , we show that thematre - bruxelles solution to einstein s field equations in a flat frw background with a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 can be rewritten in the form of a generalized second law of thermodynamics .<n> the new law takes into account the energy - momentum tensor of the universe , as well as the curvature of spacetime . as a consequence ,<n> the equation of state at the big - bang is modified , and the universe is no longer described by a spatially homogeneous and isocurvature friedmann - robertson - walker model , but by a quintessence - like model . <n> the study of cosmological perturbations is one of the most important problems of modern physics . in the last years<n> a great progress has been achieved in our understanding of the physics of the early universe @xcite , thanks to the development of statistical mechanics and the techniques of quantum field theory . at the same time , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the question of how to reconcile the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , which is the result of the we propose a new method to measure the transverse momentum of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the elliptic flow @xmath0 , which is measured as a function of the ratio of the transverse momenta of the collision products to the center - of - mass energy of the system . in this way<n> , the transverse flow can be determined with high precision . <n> epsf <n> pacs numbers : 25.75.-q , 12.38.mh , 13.85.hd epsf.def psfig.sty recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of transverse momentum distributions of ultra relativistic heavy ions ( hics ) at rhic and lhc @xcite . to date , hic data have been analyzed in terms of two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematical distributions , such as transverse momentum ( tm ) vs. rapidity ( rm ) , and elliptic - flow ( erf ) versus transverse size ( mm ) distributions . for t ms ,<n> the transverse - momentum distributions are found to be well described by : we present a table of classical functions from string theory .<n> this table , called the _ string table _ , consists of all the functions @xmath0 in the string table that arise in string theory as solutions of linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . <n> the purpose of this paper is to point out that the table is not complete , and that there are functions that do not belong to this table and that are not contained in any of the other tables . in particular , we do not have any table of functions for which the equations of motion are linearly independent , nor do we have any tables for which these equations do not depend on any parameter of the theory , or on the number of variables in the odes we are solving . we are interested in the complete list of all functions that arise from the linear equations of string theory in the form of equations that are linear combinations of odes @xcite . here<n> we will focus on the classical side of the subject , as we will see from the example given in table [ s .- m . abramowitz and i. m. ryshik , _ introduction to superstring theory ",

acyl myositol derivatives 5 , 6 and 7 , respectively . also , varied patterns of hydroxyl group protection can be obtained by the cleavage of ortho esters with reducing agents . we show that the conversion of orthobenzoate 3 to the 2-o - benzoyl derivative 6 proceeds via the intermediacy of a 1,2-bridged 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium ion .<n> orthoacetate 2 was prepared by treating myo - inositol with triethyl orthoacetate and ptsa in dmf under reflux as previously reported . treatment of 2 with aqueous tfa ( 10:1 ) gives 2-o-@xmath0 with complete selectivity in quantitative yield in mechanistic nmr and labeling experiments . in these studies , we found that acid hydrolysis of 2 leads to the selective formation of ester 5 , the latter presumably arising from adventitious water . we now report full details and extension of this work including mechanistic nmnr and labels . <n> _ keywords _ : anticancer agents , conversion , anticancer target , nmr acidic hydrolysis of orthoacetate triol 2 in deuterated tfa and cdcl3 was carried out in various solvents .<n> chelation - controlled regioselective protection of the c-4 and c-6 hydroxyl groups was achieved in excellent yield . in order to further investigate the high regioselectivity and also to further understand the observed deuterium incorporation , both the c-2 hydroxyl - free and protected orthoacetates 4,6-di - o - benzyl orthoacetate ( 12 ) and 2,4,6-tri - o-benzyl ortho acetate ( 13 ) were synthesized . <n> synthesis of 4 and 6 hydroxyl groups of the orthoacetate was also investigated . acid hydrolysis of 3 in dmf was used to synthesize orthobenzoate 6 , orthoformate 1 , and tribenzyl orthoacetate 13 .<n> the starting material was treated with deuterated tfa and the reaction was carried out in dmso as the reaction solvent . in c nmr ,<n> the species starting material showed up in trace amounts , but some intermediate species were not observed . additionally , h nmr spectra taken up to 5 days showed no peaks due to incorporation of deuterium into the methyl group of starting material , along with a minute amount of some other broad peaks , perhaps corresponding to an intermediate species . @xmath0as@xmath1 nmr was used to study the conversion of 2-o - benzoyl - myo - inositol ( 14 ) to intermediates involved in the acid hydrolysis reaction of orthobenzoate 3 .<n> we established that the acyl regioisomer 6 is not a migratory product of the hydrolysis reaction . a novel intermediate intermediate with the same thermodynamic stability as the intermediate ( )-14 was also observed . <n> # 1 we report the discovery of a new 1,2-bridged 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylium ion ( dioxolenium ion ) ( )-15 , previously reported in the literature as the ,-dialkoxybenzyl cation ( , )-16 .<n> the new dioxolanylium intermediate is found to possess characteristic downfield signals at 6.12 and 6.29 ppm , corresponding to h-1 and h-2 of the inositol ring protons , and the coupling constant between them is unusually large ( j12 9.0 hz , while j12 1.9 hz for orthobenzoate 3 ) owing to the incorporation of c-1 and c-2 into the five - membered dioxolintylium ring . 1,2-bridged dioxolanylium intermediates and products have been synthesized and characterized by means of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .<n> chelation - controlled regioselective protection of the hydroxyl groups of 3 was achieved using 4,6-di - o - methyl 2-o - benzoate product and deuterated tributyldimethyl sulfoxide ( tfa ) to afford high yield . <n> the formation of intermediates between dioxolonylium and orthobenzoate was observed by h nmr for the first time , and the structure was confirmed by c nmr measurements . in the presence of starting material or product , 1,2- and 3-bridged ion intermediates<n> were also observed , with the latter showing a slightly twisted boat conformation and aromatic vicinal protons . more stable 1,2-bridged dioxolanylium ion is produced by rearrangement of a 1,3- bridged dioxanylium ( dioxenium ) ion intermediate , when the 2-hydroxyl group in the starting material is free for instant rearrangement .<n> therefore , only 1- or 3-o - subsituted product is obtained , providing further evidence of the involvement of the 1,3-bridged ion in the initial stages of the acid hydrolysis . orthobenzoates were synthesized to facilitate nmr experiments , with the anticipation that the initial opening of the benzoate cage might be observed due to the absence of a 2-hydroxyal , thus preventing the formation of any 1,2- bridged intermediates or even a potential transient 1,2,3-cage structure . however , nmr was used to open the cage in the h and c nmr spectra , suggesting a rapid equilibration . we report nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies of 2,6,6-tri - o - benzyl 1,3,5-orthobenzoate and 2,6-di - di - cationic 1,3-dioxan-2-ylium in aqueous solutions of starting materials ranging in stoichiometry from starting material 24 to 26 .<n> treatment with deuterated transition - functional approximation ( tfa ) was used to obtain a dynamic equilibrium mixture of starting material and the respective , 1,3-bridged dioxanylium ion , demonstrating rapid equilibration of the starting material , ring - opening , and ring closure resulting in ring - closure acid hydrolysis of all starting 2, 6-di and 2-di products , as well as 1/3-o - benzoate ester products from the same starting material ( 25 ) , starting material with deshielded inositol and aromatic protons in the nmr spectrum . in the h nmr spectral range , treatment of 25 with deuterrated t fa again showed broad signals in the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) corresponding to deshielding of the carbons and the aromatic region of the orthobenzoates , again demonstrating a dynamic equilib acid hydrolysis of orthobenzoate 3 in tfa and dcm gives a minor yield of 8% where a trifluoro acetyl group was substituted at the c-5 position along with the 1- or 3-o - benzoyl major product .<n> this acylation at thec-5 position and not on the c-1 or c-3 positions also implies that the 5-hydroxyl group free for esterification by solvent may only be open to give a bridge between o-1 and o-3 , leaving the 5-hydrol group , which is protected by the 2-oh , free to be esterified . we have explored the formation of deuterium - incorporated orthoesters , orthoacetate 2 and orthoformate 1 , under various selective conditions , using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .<n> starting materials were first synthesized from a solution of orthoacetate and benzoate , with the benzoate ester at o-1 or o-3 , via a 1,3-bridged hemiorthoester intermediate 34 . under selective conditions used in opening ortho esters 2 and 3 onto the c-2 position ,<n> orthoformates 1 and 2 were also explored . <n> orthoacetate was studied first , followed by orthobenzoate 3 , both starting material and intermediate species being seen in the nmr spectrum . with a longer alkyl chain , a new orthoester was synthesized , and further studies were carried out with deuterated tfa : water and cdcl3 , the first species being studied after 3 days , along with very small amounts of products . we report the synthesis of a new 1,3,5-orthoester , myo - inositol orthobutanoate ( 4 ) , in high yield using deuterated tetramethyl fluoride alpha ( tfa ) and a catalytic amount of ptsa in dmf at 140 c , followed by quantitative yield and recrystallization in water and methanol for which an x - ray crystal structure was obtained .<n> the starting material 4 selectively opened to give the axial 2-o - ester product , 4-o - butanoate , under the above acidic hydrolysis conditions , as already established for orthoacetate 2 and orthobenzoate 3 . intermediates to many deuterium labeled synthetic analogues that could be used to study biologically important metabolic pathways or chemical reactions have been identified .<n> treatment of 4 in deuterated tfa for 24 h followed by the addition of water in the subsequent hydrolysis gave the 2-o - c(o)cd2ch2ch3myo - inositol as the major product ( over 92% ) with trace amounts of 2-o-@xmath0 butanoate 7 and 2-o(o-o)chdch2chi3m yo - inoositol , perhaps arising due to adventitious water . to confirm this , treatment of 5 in both deuterating tf and cdcl3 for 9 days and deuterate t fa and d2o for 9days and monitored by nmr spectroscopy for deuterum exchange over 9 days gave only decomposition and migration products . <n> = 1 acid hydrolysis of c-2 unprotected inositol - based orthoesters , apart from the orthoformate , was found to lead to the formation of a range of 2-o - acyl myo - insitol polyphosphates .<n> pentakisphosphate 11 could be synthesized from a 1,2-bridged 2-substituted-1,3-dioxolan-2-y , which was subsequently oxidized in situ by m - cpba . 6 could also be phosphorylated with the phosphitylating agent bis(benzyloxy)diisopropylaminophosphine in good yield ( 94% ) using 5-phenyltetrazole followed by oxidation . incorporation of deuterium into the -methylene group at inositol c-2 of an alkyl phosphoric ester ( 2-o - c(o)d2r ) is possible when the corresponding alkyl orthoester is treated in deuterated acid under anhydrous conditions , with deuterum exchange taking place before hydrolysis .<n> furthermore , using these observations , we describe a most efficient route for gram - scale synthesis of ins(1,3,4,5,6)p511 and 2-os(@xmath0o)-o - benzoyl ins(3,4,4,5)p59 via myo - inosositol 1,3,5-orthobenzoate 3 . we report on the high - resolution ( hrms / esi - tof ) x - ray spectra of a series of ultra -

induced changes in the redox state of cells is of fundamental importance in cell biology , chemistry , physics and biology . for example , the detection and quantification of the changes in redox state due to the coxsack -

sensitive flavoprotein ( nadh ) signal measured in normoxic rat lung cells .<n> rat lung treatment with kcn increased lung lactate / pyruvate by 22% . in the absence of kcn ,<n> lung perfusion with nadh increased lung surface nadh signal by 2% . when kcn was used to target the mitochondrial electron transport chain , the nadh fluorescence signal measured on the surface of the lung increased by 22% in comparison with treatment with no kcn and 22% in treatment with the metabolic inhibitors lipdh and lipdh . unlike nadh which has cytosolic and mitochondrial components sources of redox -sensitive flavo protein ( fad ) include succinate dehydrogenase ( complex ii ) , lipoamide dehydrogenase ( lipdh), and redox - insensitive flavo proteins ( ros ) including succinate , mitochondria , and mitochondria . since electrons channeled through complex ii produce 4-fold more mitochondrial superoxide than electrons channelled through complex i , an apparent decrease in complex ii activity could be a means by the cells to reduce ros formation under hyperoxoxic conditions . <n> [ [ section ] ] we demonstrate that stimulated glycolysis in rat lung tissue can be used to measure the lung surface fad signal .<n> fisher ab demonstrated that rat exposure to 100%  documentclass[12pt]minimal  , usepackageamsfonts$end document  increase in the lung lactate / pyruvate ratio . since this ratio is a measure of cytosolic ,<n> this study suggests that both tissue cytoplasm and cytoplasm are more reduced in hyperoxic lungs than normoxic lungs . <n> lung is one of the most important organs in the human body , and yet , its understanding and treatment are far from satisfactory . in this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that rat lung glycolysis ( lch ) can be directly measured in a physiological physiological environment . using rat lch in conjunction with fisher s method of stimulated lyman-@xmath0 ( fad )<n> , the fad signal was measured from the rat lung surface for 48 hours , as well as for 5 hours . from these data<n> it was possible to determine the fad in each tissue , which was found to be significantly reduced in the hyperox the hyperoxia -

law source number counts , and extended the formulation for general number counts by @xcite . in comparison with their own method , they claim to use a monte carlo approach to evaluate in that case . however , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , there is an expression for the fluctuations and we can utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . as a result , their setting assumes that the dispersion of the error does not depend on the source flux , even in such a simple case , but they pointed out that when the confusion noises dominate the error , the total noise can not be gaussian and gave a qualitative discussion on the problem . we clarified the difference between we discuss the physical meaning of  fluctuation ' and  confusion limit ' in a unified manner , which means that they occur in a same manner .<n> we derive the fluctuation and confusion probability distributions ( pdfs ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuation , and show that they are consistent with each other . <n> the cmb is the primary source of the primordial density perturbations . in the standard cosmological model ,<n> the primordial fluctuation pdf @xmath0 is proportional to the hubble constant @xcite , while the confusion pdf is related to the confusion limit of the source flux observed by a single instrument . on the other hand , in some cosmological models<n> , the primordial noise pdf is expected to be a power - law pdf , since the primordial fluctuations are proportional to hubble s constant , whereas the confusion - limit pdf is inversely proportional to it . as a result , _<n>  consistency of fluctuation pdfs between experiments ' _ , i.e. , how well a given instrument can constrain a given model with a given set of input parameters , is a key issue in cosmology , because a given theory can be tested by we propose a new method to obtain the number counts of point and clustered sources in a beam .<n> we formulate a source confusion limit as a function of the beam size , and obtain the confusion noise distribution by solving the monte carlo wave equation for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of sources . by applying the method to a recent experiment ,<n> we show that the confusion -

resolution imaging is to determine the position of the point sources in the image data . in order to distinguish point sources from clustered sources , we need to subtract the background image data from the point - source position data , which is a non - trivial task in practice @xcite . to solve this problem<n> , one can take advantage of the so - called _ source confusion _ , i.e. , the fact that the number count of a point source depends on the recent work has shown that the maximum number of counts that can be confused with a single source in a given data set is limited by the exponential of the number of times the source can be resolved to within the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .<n> we show that this limit depends on the character @xmath0 of the underlying number count . for sources described by a power - law ,<n> the confusion limit is given by the exponent of the cumulative count slope . in the case of clustered sources<n> , the limit is a cutoff signal . <n> the exponential number count ( xc ) law @xcite is one of the most widely used number - count counting laws ( lcs ) , along with the kolmogorov - smirnov law ( ksl ) and the log - log law ( tll ) of number - counts per spectral bin , which have been used to estimate the number density of luminous x - ray sources ( lsbs ) from _ quasar _ and _ pulsar _ data , and to derive constraints on the nature of the x - rays in these sources . however , it has been shown that in this paper , we study the confusion limit of single and clustered photon sources . for single sources ,<n> we derive an analytic formula for the confusion limits .<n> we also present an empirical rule of thumb for the @xmath0 confusion limit . <n> photon source is one of the most important sources of light in the universe . in recent years<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in using photons from different kinds of sources to perform various kinds of measurements , such as precision metrology , spectroscopy , and quantum information processing @xcite . among them , the measurement of the position and momentum of a single photon plays an important role . as a particular example , it is widely used in precision metrology to determine the position of the photon with a precision better than the measurement errors . on the other hand , as a source of coherent light , synchrotron radiation has been widely used for various applications , including precision measurements @x<n> . however , a photon beam from a synchrotron source is scattered by a beamline , which makes the beam pattern unpredictable , leading to the so - called beam confusion , i.e. the uncertainty of the in this paper , we study the beam - beam correlations in the confusion limit of the number counts .<n> we present an iterative formula for the general number counts and compare it with the exact result for a gaussian beam . we study the beam - size dependence of the number - count statistics for @xmath0 collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> we find that the beam size effect can be more important than the source - clustering effect , which is usually considered in the literature . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hics ) have been studied for a long time , since they are one of the most powerful tools to probe the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the strong - field regime @xcite . in rhic<n> , the pb - pb collisions are of particular interest because of their high rate and the possibility of such a large number of unbound particles in the final state . for the last decade ,<n> the rhic experiments have been the focus of intense theoretical and experimental efforts . due to the high luminosity and the large initial energy of the beams , rhic has become the leading source of inelastic neutron - proton scattering at rhic ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for recent reviews ) as well as for the inelastic x - ray scattering ( ines ) at x - in order to understand the distribution of infrared and submillimeter galaxies , it is important to have some knowledge of the source confusion limits for them , which can be estimated by various methods . here<n> we focus on the three - dimensional galaxy clustering , as a typical example of the related issues .<n> property of higher - order galaxy clustering still remains a matter of debate , hence we should introduce a certain closure relation to cut the sequence . generally , a hierarchical _ ansatz _ is employed for the correlation functions , both from phenomenological basis and theoretical considerations of bbgky equations . as we have discussed above ,<n> if the beam profile is a gaussian , and some specific functional form is obtained for @xmath0 , similar numerical computation can be performed in parallel with equation [ eq . : conf_general ] . in the infrared band , we can handle any point sources as far as we can have some information of their clustering . today , many large infrared or submillimeter missions are planned or in progress . for a comprehensive overview , see * ? ?<n> * ; * e.g. ? * ) . property we study the angular two - point correlation function of the _ iras _ @xmath0-band galaxies , @xcite .<n> we show that the correlation function is strongly affected by the clustering of infrared galaxies . for any depth of the survey ,<n> the contribution of higher - order clustering rapidly decreases with increasing depth , and this dilution of clustering is more effective for high - order correlations . <n> the angular correlation function ( acf ) of the galaxy distribution is one of the most fundamental observables in the infrared sky . in the last decade<n> , the number of objects detected in the mid - infrared ( mir ) and infrared ( ir ) bands has increased dramatically , reaching about one billion detected objects in the most recent surveys , including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , pan - starrs1 , _<n> spitzer_/mips , lsst , herschel_/spire , vlt / x - shooter , hst / isaac newton spectrograph ( hsst / acs ) etc ..<n> this rapid increase in the number density of infrared sources has the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope is an ideal instrument to study the large - scale structure of the universe , because it has a good collecting area of @xmath0 m@xmath1 .<n> we show that the confusion - related statistics associated with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy can be strongly affected by the correlation structure . in particular , we find that the statistics of the cmb asymmetries are significantly different from those of the large scale structure ( lss ) , which is a consequence of the strong correlation structure between the two . for example ,<n> the statistics related to the confusion of the galaxy number counts show a clear dependence on the slope of the power - law number count models , i.e. , the index of the integrated counts . on the other hand<n> , these statistics do not depend on the shape of the model , and they do not show any dependence on whether the counts are localized at the source , as long as the source is separated from the survey path . <n> cosmic microwave radiation ( cmr ) is one of the most important probes of the early universe @xcite . to we present a measurement of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution in the _ iras _ deep survey field .<n> we find that the galaxy distribution is statistically inhomogeneous , and the distribution is well approximated by a gaussian with a mean and a dispersion of @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 and @xcite , respectively , in the sense that the dispersion of the mean is larger than that of the variance . on the other hand ,<n> the distribution of the individual galaxies is well described by a single power - law , which is in contrast to the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) law for which the dispersion is much larger than the mean . <n> galaxies are good tracers of the large - scale structure of the universe : they are bright in the infrared ( ir ) , but they are dim in the optical ( uv ) and vice versa ( see , e.g. , * ? ?<n> * , etc . in the review , ] ; they are  dark matter ' objects ; and they are the most numerous ( by mass ) in the universe ( we present a new method to estimate the confusion noise in the infrared background , based on the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity .<n> our formulation is fundamentally based on this pdf , and it is the most suitable method of calculating it from the measured projected information . <n> first of all , we show that the effect of clustering can be very severe if the number counts are described by _ a single power - law_. we also found that the relative contribution of clustering to the total fluctuation compared with poisson component becomes larger for large @xmath0 . these are consistent with the results reported by @xcite for dusty galaxies at ir wavelengths . our central aim was to estimate _ the power spectrum _ of the confusion - limit flux , i.e. , the rms of confusion noise , which is the second - order quantity . since confusion noise is one of the most important quantities in cosmology , it is very important to know its properties , especially in the case of the infrared ( ir ) background . in the past few years<n> , a great effort has been made to measure the ir fluctuation from the galaxies , using various ground - based deep galaxy surveys by _ iso _ revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy counts .<n> the observed number counts of infrared galaxies can not be described by a power - law function . here<n> we present some theoretical models of infrared galaxy number counts at 90 and 170 @xmath0 m , which can be used to calculate the confusion limits of such realistic counts , and the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of such infrared galaxy sources . <n> _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_is a global , multi - wavelength infrared astronomical satellite launched in 2003 @xcite , with a collecting area of about 100 m@xmath1 and an effective wavelength range of about 1030 , from the far - infrared to the mid - infrared . since the iso satellite was first launched , iso has continued to provide deeper and deeper galaxy surveys , especially in the near - infrared and optical bands . in the optical band ,<n> the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2degsrs )@ xmm - newton have provided important insights into the galaxy distribution and evolution . we investigate the limits of the fluctuation analysis of infrared and submillimeter data . we found that the limit is not significantly affected by clustering , but the confusion limit is reduced up to @xmath0 % in the far - infrared .<n> we also find that the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the faintest fluctuation in the submillimeter wavelengths are affected by the clustering and confusion effects , and that the tail of the pdf becomes heavier than that in the infrared wavelengths . <n> fluctuation analysis is one of the most important methods to study galaxy evolution at high redshift @xcite . in this analysis<n> , we consider the number counts and the probability distributions of the number of detected objects , as functions of the fluxes , positions , redshifts , magnitudes and angular sizes of the sources . here ,<n> we focus on the limit of fluctuation analysis in the wavelengths of infrared ( ir ) , submillimeter ( smm ) and millimeter ( mm ) bands , which will be obtained by future infrared facilities such as _ astro - f _ , _ sirtf _ and _ herschel space observatory_. in the ir band , the the source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington . in this line , only the work of @xcite has made attempt to tackle the difficult problem and given solutions to a few simple cases . by making extensive use of the two - dimensional information of clustering , we have formulated the submillimeter source confusion as a function of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of _ iras _ galaxies , which is the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation .<n> we derived a useful result for the contribution of clustering to the fluctuation of the background at submillimeter and radio wavelengths . we studied the statistical properties of infrared galaxy confusion noise , which is caused by infrared galaxies with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .<n> we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical characteristics of the confusion noise caused by the sources with the prescribed correlation structure<n> . then we calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . at @xmath0 ,<n> the probability density function of the fluctuation intensity broadened by the clustering effect , i.e. , increase of the variance , was found . as for the probability at these wavelength bands , the peak probability also decreases up to @xcite . <n> the infrared galaxy ( ig ) population is one of the most important tracers of the large - scale structure in the universe . among them , infrared galaxies are of particular interest because of the fact that they are the most luminous sources in the near - infrared , and they have the largest number density at all ir wavelengths . in the ig population<n> , there are two kinds of sources : ( 1 ) _ a submillimeter galaxies are dusty starbursts , and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation . in this paper , we present a new method for the galaxy - galaxy correlation analysis of the _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf _ submillimeter surveys .<n> our method is based on the fact that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the submillimeter galaxy counts is strongly affected by galaxy clustering , which is caused by the tail of the probability generating function ( pgf ) . as a result ,<n> the galaxy correlation function ( gcf ) becomes heavier than that of the galaxy distribution . <n> we estimate the galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of present data , using the @xmath0-@xmath1 statistics . for the current data by _<n> astro -f _ , the best - fit values of the matter density parameter , m , are found to be , , ( m_rm k-1)$ ] and ( m - k-rm m-1), equiv  ( |u|leq 1),(endaligned ) we derive the first- and second - order cumulants for the fluctuation field of clustered sources .<n> these summary statistics are extensively used in the field of structure formation , especially for counts - in - cells analysis . here<n> we present how to derive these quantities from the laplace equation for the first - order fluctuation field , and from the kolmogorov - smirnov ( lt ) statistics for the second order field . in this paper , we propose a cumulant expansion method to calculate the cumulant of the second - order green s function of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) non - linear sigma model .<n> the method is based on the concept of generating function of cumulants . as an application ,<n> we compute the cumulants of the 1d ising model and the ising - xy model in the weak - coupling regime . <n> _ introduction. _ in recent years , a great deal of work has been devoted to the development of cumulant method ( cm ) @xcite , which can be regarded as a generalization of the standard cumulant ( cm)@xcite to cumulants in higher dimensions . in cm<n> , one generates a set of ( @xmath0 ) variables by summing over all the terms in the so - called cumulant generating function ( cgf ) of the first order , and then , by a suitable transformation , obtains the final ( final - order ) cumulant . the method has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems , such as 1d quantum spin chains , ising models , bose - we present a theoretical study of the transport properties of quantum dots ( qds ) formed by ultracold fermionic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices .<n> we calculate the conductance as a function of the dot size and the temperature , and compare the results with those obtained from a conventional fermi - hubbard model . in particular , we show that the temperature dependence of the optical conductance can be well described by a power - law , @xmath0 , with an exponent that depends on the quantum dot size . <n> ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice form a new class of quantum systems , the so - called quantum dots @xcite . as a consequence of the strong correlations between the atoms ,<n> quantum dots are subject to many experimental and theoretical problems , such as transport properties , thermal conductance , phonon spectra , quantum hall effects , electron - electron collisions , to name a few . for a long time<n> it has been believed that quantum dots should be insulators , but recent experiments have shown that they can also be insulators at room temperature . however , this conclusion was based on the assumption that we derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian for a spin-@xmath0 two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) coupled to a quantized magnetic field .<n> the resulting model is a generalization of the bec model , which is known to exhibit a topological phase transition at a critical magnetic field @xmath1 . in the low - temperature limit ,<n> the model reduces to the well - known kitaev - heisenberg model . as a result<n> , we obtain a closed - form expression for the ground state energy of the 2d bec in the presence of an external magnetic field of arbitrary strength . <n> _ introduction. _<n> spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in quantum many - body systems has been extensively studied due to its fundamental importance in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite , quantum simulation of quantum mechanics ( qm)@xcite and quantum computation ( qc ) ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) . among the various soi models , the one that has received the most attention<n> is the one based on the we present a study of the thermal conductivity @xmath0 of ultrathin ferromagnetic films of different thickness .<n> we find that the temperature dependence of the conductivity is well described by a power - law , with an exponent close to unity . for thicker films ,<n> the exponent decreases with the thickness of the film , indicating a transition from a thermal to a non - thermal regime . <n> ultrathin magnetic films ( ufms ) are of great interest because of their unique properties , such as very high critical currents @xcite , which may lead to a new state of matter called the  quantum hall regime ''@xcite or the so - called  anomalous hall regime '@xmath1 , where a large number of particles are expected to be trapped and/or excited . in order to investigate the properties of these novel states of matter , _ ab initio _ calculations have been performed on films of various thickness , ranging from a few tens of nanometers up to a few micrometers , and various magnetic fields , including those typical of ultra - thin ferromagnetic ( u , p ) films . here , we present results for the we present a numerical result for the confusion limit of a gaussian beam , which corresponds to the result obtained for the general case by @xcite .<n> we tabulate a numerical formula that shows the dependence of the  1/30 sources per beam ' rule of observational astronomers : the steeper the slope is , the more severe the confusion becomes . <n> the beam profile plays an important role in source detection algorithms . here<n> we show a useful analytic formula for the case of airy beam : @xmath0 , where the subscript c represents that the standard deviation of the beam is a numerical factor that depends on the details of the source detection algorithm and beam profile . for power - law source counts ,<n> we obtain an analytic expression for the corresponding confusion limit : (s_1),ds_1 int_s_2  s_2h(bm x2)mathfrakn(s_2)ds_2right ] w_2( bm x ) x_bm _2 ) d_b m x _1 d@xmath1 x_2$ ] . in this letter , we present a new approach to the problem of galaxy number counts in optical interferometers based on the theory of the point - field .<n> we show that the number counts of sources per beam of an optical instrument can be well approximated by a power - law , @xmath0 , with a slope @xcite . this power law can be derived from the angular correlation function of galaxies , which is known to obey a power law : the power law index is , however , a function of the angular size of the sources , i.e. , the number of galaxies per unit area . using this model ,<n> we predict that the galaxy number count in an interferometric instrument is proportional to the square root of the beam size , and we derive the theoretical prediction for the number count of a single source in a single instrument . we also show that this prediction is in excellent agreement with the data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . <n> interferometry is one of the most important tools in the study of large - scale structure of the universe . in the optical domain , there are two main types of we present a new technique for the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) , based on the application of two - point correlation analysis to a gaussian beam pattern on the sky .<n> we show that the exponent of the power - law source number counts is @xmath0 , and we derive an analytic expression for the angular correlation function , which is independent of the angular separation between sources , as well as the angular scale length of angular correlation , the standard deviation of the beam pattern and the signal - to - noise ratio of a signal . <n> we demonstrate the feasibility of our technique by applying it to a simulated gw background , consisting of point sources distributed uniformly over the sky and decaying according to a poisson process . in the context of gravitational wave astronomy ,<n> the search for gw - like signals has become a very active field of research in recent years @xcite . to date , there are several types of gw searches , including : type ia , type ii and type ib / ic , all of which suffer from the problem of non - detection . the type - ii gw search is the most promising , because it is robust against we present a novel approach to the problem of point source detection based on a laplace - stieltjes expansion of the number of sources in a beam .<n> the method is based on the inverse laplace transform of the distribution of the intensity of a point field measured in the presence of a classical point source , which is assumed to be detected in the same way as the classical point sources . to illustrate the method , we apply it to the analysis of data from the slac linear collider ( slc ) . <n> lhc <n> 1e@xmath0 ps . @xmath1 lhc 1e <n> ps @xcite the detection of point sources is an important step towards the ultimate goal of an all - particle , all - scalar , high - precision collider . in the classical case , it is well known that the average number of detected sources is proportional to the flux density of the sources , and that the differential source number counts are proportional to their flux density . however , in the lhc case it is not straightforward to determine the average correlation between the detected sources and to estimate the detection limit of a sample . as a result , we present the first results of a deep ( @xmath0 ) , wide - field survey of the large - scale structure ( lss ) carried out with the multi - mirror deimos instrument ( dfx ) on the 100 m telescope of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in la silla , chile .<n> the survey , designed to detect point - like sources down to a limiting flux density level of about 10@xmath1 mjy / beam , covers an area of @xxmath2 square degrees on the sky and reaches a depth of about 100 times the eddington limit . <n> the main scientific goal of the survey is the determination of the cosmological parameters , such as the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the mass function of the universe , and the evolution of the galaxy and its environment . in order to achieve this goal , we have developed a new method of source detection , which is based on the statistical exploitation of the random nature of the detected sources . using this method ,<n> we have performed a deep survey of a large area of the sky with a total integration time of about 4h , reaching a limiting we present the results of a search for point - like sources in @xmath0 , poisson , and gauss - bonnet beams produced by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> we show that the number of sources in each beam can be used to predict the confusion limit of the search , which is determined by the cutoff flux level used to define the cutoff of the beam s flux distribution . using a simple model for the correlation function produced by a single source , we find that confusion is reduced by a factor of two compared to the classical search . <n> relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments have produced a wealth of high - energy , high - intensity astrophysical sources in the last two decades @xcite . among these sources ,<n> point sources are of particular interest because of their ability to reveal the nature of the colliding particles . in this context<n> , it has been shown that the detection of a point source in a beam can reveal the position of the source as well as its charge , transverse momentum and transverse energy . however , the efficiency of this technique has been questioned due to a number of limitations of current state - of - the - art detectors",

known rxj0510.1 + 2323ab ( fwhm @x 4900 au ) . at the distance of the galaxy , the orbital separations of the two components are ( 0.53 pc ) and ( 0.38 au , 0.37 pc , respectively ; we estimate the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) and the new lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motion @xmath0 yr@xmath1 now provide a fresh opportunity to expand the census of cpm doubles , including systems with _ hipparcos _ components .<n> a systematic search of these new catalogs has yielded 424 new pairs of wide cpm binaries , increasing the number of known double systems from 1124 to 1124 . <n> the distribution of projected physical separations between the components of the wide binaries is consistent with a power law distribution of the form @xcite , with @x.1 , significantly different from pik s law , which gives rise to a power - law distribution with a slope of @x . for the sample as a whole , we find that the distribution in projected separations is well fit by the form : @x_lambda658/a$ ] , where the best - fitting constant is @x, ] = -1.35pm0.08rm s-1 , $ ] and the coefficients for the power laws are @x<n> .eps gsave newpath we use the very high completeness of the lspm - north common proper motion ( cpm ) catalog to obtain a statistically complete census of cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars .<n> the completeness is @xmath0 yr@xmath1 over the entire northern sky down to an apparent magnitude of 1 , and is even more complete in high galactic latitude fields . in these fields ,<n> the cpm completeness is estimated to be as high as 89% . <n> we find that the fraction of stars in cpm pairs with separations less than 1 arcminute increases with decreasing magnitude , while the fraction increases with increasing distance from the center of mass . at fainter apparent magnitudes<n> , the fraction is even higher , with the fraction increasing to 82% . for separations<n> less than one arcminute , we find no cpm companion to a main - sequence star brighter than a magnitude of 25.5 . using the proper motion vectors of the @xcite catalog of nearby stars and the nltt cpm catalog of stars with significant proper motions , which we re - analyzed with the superblink image - subtraction software , of 61,977 stars with proper motions greater the large sky area proper motion ( lspm ) survey currently has the largest catalog of proper motion stars in the northern sky .<n> the proper motion catalog contains more than @xmath0 stars with accuracies better than 1% , and the proper motions of these stars span a large range of galactocentric distances . in this paper , we present the first analysis of proper motions in the large area sky proper motion survey ( la spm - north ) , which has more than doubled the number of stars with proper motion measurements over the past five years @xcite . using a maximum likelihood fit to the lsam - north proper motion data ,<n> we show that there are now over 10,000 stars in this region with proper motions greater than 10% of the local standard of rest . among these stars , there are over 11,000 cpm pairs , or wide binaries with separations between 1 and 10 stellar units . of these wide binaries , about half<n> are newly discovered , as are about half of the newly identified proper motion binaries . <n> stars in binary systems are an important source of information about the distribution of stars on the sky , especially in regions of the sky where the density of we present an empirical analysis of the stellar proper motion distribution in the large synoptic survey - north ( lspm - north ) .<n> we show that proper motion pairings are more common among stars with larger proper motion than among stars of the same proper motion . also , proper motion pairs are more likely to be found in denser regions of the sky , such as clusters , groups and associations . <n> proper motion ( @xmath0 ) is the sum of the squares of the positions of all stars in the sky divided by the proper motion of the host galaxy @xcite . for a given stellar population ,<n> the distribution of proper motion with respect to the galactic plane is well described by a gaussian distribution , with a mean proper motion that is proportional to the square root of the distance from the center of the galaxy to the observer , and with a dispersion that is independent of the luminosity of the star . in the case of a population of stars , defined as the number of stars within a given proper motion interval , the distribution is skewed towards stars that are closer to us , in the sense that more stars are closer towards us at a given luminosity , i.e. , hipparcos parallaxes from the lspm - north region ( @xmath0yr@xmath1 ) have been interpreted as evidence for large - scale structure ( lss ) in the form of compact pre - main sequence ( cpm ) pairs .<n> we show that the distribution of pairs in the catalog is consistent with a distribution of cpm pairs that is _ chance _ , i.e. , formed by chance in a pre - processing process , and not resulting from gravitational lensing or lensing - induced lensing . <n> the discovery of a large number of high proper motion objects ( hsdos ) at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) has been interpreted in terms of large scale structure @xcite . in the context of galaxy formation and evolution ,<n> the saao is the world s largest single source of astrometric and photometric data , with more than 2000 sources detected so far , most of which are globular clusters ( gc ) . at the same time<n> , there is a growing consensus that large scale structures are present in the milky way ( mw ) as well , in the sagittarius - wide binary systems ( wbs ) are binary systems in which the orbital period of the components is comparable to or larger than the period of each star in a single system .<n> these systems are expected to be common proper motion binaries ( cpm ) , since they are characterized by the same proper motion ratio , @xmath0 , and hence the same orbital period . here , we report the results of a search for cpm binaries in the _ gaia _ proper motion catalog . using n - body simulations ,<n> we show that the proper motions of stars in the gaia catalog are too low to support pairs of stars with orbital periods larger than 0.12 yr@xmath1 , the lower limit of the catalog s lower limit . instead , pairs with larger orbital periods are most likely to be chance alignments , resulting from the superposition of two stars in a cpm state . <n> the search is conducted in a parameter space defined by the ratio of the proper motion differences of the stars to the distance between the centers of their orbits . in the parameter space<n> explored , there exists a limit beyond which the density of chance alignment pairs exceeds that of cpm doubles the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) , currently under construction in southern arizona , will survey an area of the sky @xmath0 deg@xmath1 , including the northern celestial equator , with sufficient angular resolution to detect the motion of stars on the sky with a high degree of confidence .<n> the proper motions of stars in this region are expected to be very similar , making it possible to search for pairs with large differences in their proper motions , so - called cpm doubles . here<n> we report the first results of such a search , using a series of n - body simulations to identify pairs which are chance alignments , or pairs whose proper motions are such that they should have the same probability of being double stars , as a function of the time over one year from the start of the survey . in the first year of operation ,<n> we have identified 17 double stars with projected separations between 1 and 10au , and proper motions between 0 and 1000kms@xcite . <n> the large area survey ( lat ) is an ambitious , wide - field , high resolution survey of the northern galactic plane ( lp ) @xcite ( see  we present the first results of a systematic search for wide ( separations of a few au ) multiples in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> our search is based on a new method of searching for orbital motion caused by the difference in proper motion between the components , and is designed to be as sensitive as possible to the presence of contamination from chance alignments . <n> we report the discovery of a new triple system , lspm j0722 + 0849s ( hip 35756 ) , with an orbital period @xmath0 days , an orbital velocity of 735 km s@xmath1 and a common proper motion of the two components . in addition , we report on the detection of 4 new wide multiples , all of which have not been observed before in other catalogs : cpm j0805 + 4715 , cpm l1551 + 4321 , lhss j1802 + 4307 and lsam j2334 + 4522 . since the advent of nasa s _ kepler _ space telescope , a large number of binaries have been discovered as multiples of nearby stars @xcite . we report the discovery of a new class of double - lined spectroscopic binaries , which we term cpm doubles , consisting of a pair of main sequence stars that have very large proper motions ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) .<n> the angular separation of the two components is only a few milliarcseconds , and their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are consistent with being at the same distance , thus indicating that they are physically unrelated and thus likely to be cpm binaries . <n> spectroscopic binaries ( sbs ) are stellar systems in which the primary and secondary components have very different _<n> proper motions _ and thus similar _ radial velocities _ , as well as _ surface _ temperatures and _ atmospheric _ properties . in most cases ,<n> however , they are also very similar in other respects , such as , for example , their luminosity function , chemical composition , rotation rate , etc . the primary star s or secondary s<n> proper motion is measured from the method of radial velocity ( rv ) @xcite , while the rv of the secondary star is derived from its _ velocity _ @ we have searched the _ hipparcos _ catalog for wide pairs of stars ( cpm ) in the direction of the galactic plane ( r.a . , @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) .<n> our search yielded 158 candidate pairs , of which 55 were rejected as true pairs based on their angular separations , colors , proper motions , or parallaxes . of these 55 pairs<n> , we found 2 new pairs that are likely to be physical pairs . \"<n> a complete list of all cpm pairs with more than two components is given , as well as a table of the lspm catalog number of the primary , its catalog number , and the estimated parallax error in milliarcseconds , the angular separation between the components , their proper motion in r. a. and d. the proper motion of each component in a cpm pair is also given . in this paper<n> we report the results of our search for very wide pairs ( with separations greater than 100 au ) of stars in the galactic field . for each star s proper motion , color , optical -

class of single - lined spectroscopic multiples , each multiple consisting of a single , isolated , main sequence star with a companion in a short period ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) orbit . in this paper<n> , we present a search of the cpm catalog for multiples with separations in the range 0.1 - 1 kpc for stars with periods of 1 - 100 days . for a complete list of systems<n> see fig . 1 . we report the discovery of a new cpm binary in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , which we have identified as a pair of hot subdwarf b stars .<n> we have measured a parallax of @xmath0 for the primary star , and a color - magnitude diagram for the secondary , showing that it is likely to be a late - type dwarf on the standard main sequence or on the white dwarf cooling sequence , but at a distance from the sun that is inconsistent with the distance to the primary . <n> this is the first binary discovered by the automated cpm finder ( a.k.a . cpm ) , a program we have developed to find and study binary systems among the stars listed in the lspm - north catalog @xcite . in this paper , we present the cpm - discovered binary , as well as the results of a search for other possible cpm binaries . secondary stars can be used as probes of various stellar phenomena , including masses and ages , rotation , mass loss , and more . here<n> we investigate the distribution of secondary stars in the vicinity of the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequences .<n> we find that most secondaries lie close to either the standard main sequence or the cooling white dwarf sequence . <n> stars with masses @xmath0m@xmath1 are found to span a wide range of evolutionary stages , from subdwarfs to supergiants . in the late sdss class ,<n> the upper main sequence is dominated by red dwarfs @xcite , while in the lmc , it is primarily dominated by dwarfs of spectral types later than k5 @x<n> . the majority of white dwarfs are substellar , with spectral types ranging from m6 to m8 @x , but a significant number of them are hot , helium - burning dwarfs , which have not yet been explained in terms of stellar models . by the end of the t tauri phase , they have lost most of their hydrogen and helium envelopes , making them unlikely to be pre - main sequence stars we use _ hst _ wfpc2 @xmath0 and _ hipparcos _ fos images to study the companions to white dwarfs and to red dwarfs .<n> we find that the white dwarf companions are on average 0.11 mag above the main sequence , while the red dwarf companions lie on average 0.42 mag below the standard main sequence with a dispersion of 0.95 mag . <n> comparison of the positions of the objects derived here with the positions derived from a similar analysis by @xcite shows that the two sequences are physically related , and that the distance differences between the components are typically only 0.12 mag , with an rms dispersion of 0.05 mag ; this is the smallest dispersion found to date for any component of a stellar system . the physical relationship between a stellar pair and its companion is a fundamental property of stellar systems . in the milky way ,<n> this relationship is best understood in terms of the fundamental parameters of the stars : mass , radius , temperature , surface gravity , mass - loss rate , roche lobe filling factor , etc .@xcite in the solar system , these parameters are known to be related to each other by the in the course of the _ hipparcos _ catalog search , we found that there are typically @xmath0 unresolved pairs of main sequence stars or subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood , with separations ranging from 0.055 - 0.08 pc .<n> we have been conducting a similar survey in the galactic plane , finding pairs with secondaries that consistently fall on the main sequence when placed at the primary s distance , and another 11 pairs that are  uncertain '' , lying between the standard main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence . here<n> we present the first results of this survey , which has now doubled the number of known binary systems . we report the results of a search for wide cpm binaries among known spectroscopic subdwarfs .<n> we find no new pairs with separations larger than @xmath0 , with the exception of hip 35756 ( g 89 -

_hipparcos<n> _ secondaries ; 130 are wide binary pairs ; and 122 are new wide binaries , reported here for the first time . for the triples listed in genzel et al . <n> ( 2004 ) , we determine proper motions using the rnltt and lspm - north data ; for the quadruples we use the lds and luyten s catalogs . of the 400 triples with _<n> hipparcros _ <n> secondaries listed , 208 are listed in gc 04 ; these stars are indicated with a  gc '' flag in table 3 . some 134 of these were also listed in luytens s ld s catalog . we find 26 additional pairs not listed in the _gc _ catalog , and 130 new wide we have conducted a search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars in the proper motion range @xmath0 mas yr@xmath1 , and have recovered essentially all the pairs listed in the gc04 catalog .<n> we have identified virtually _ all _ known _ _ cpm companions to main sequence stars within a relatively large range of angular separations , down to an apparent magnitude of about 2 . within the limits of our search area ( the northern sky )<n> , we have found a total of 27 new pairs , 4 of which were not included in gc 04 . in the southern sky ,<n> our search has found an additional 22 pairs ; we are likely to find many more pairs among these . <n> the discovery of the galactic center ( gc ) by owens valley observatory ( ovba ) in 1996 @xcite has transformed our understanding of the structure of the inner galaxy . since then , much effort has been devoted to understanding its structure , particularly in the light of the _<n> trigonometric parallax _ ( td ) method of parallax measurement . at present , there are more than @x the lspm - north has a lower limit @xmath0 yr@xmath1 for the detection of companions to main - sequence stars in the galactic disk .<n> we extend this limit to a maximum distance of 100 parsec , and find that the distribution in projected orbital separations of the _ hipparcos_+_hipparcos _ pairs is statistically complete at this distance . <n> proper motion selection is the dominant proper motion effect in the study of galactic stellar systems . because transverse velocities of stars are strongly dependent on mass ,<n> proper motions are also sensitive to proper motions of secondaries . in the limit of zero - velocity stars , the number of companions is greatly increased . at lower transverse velocities , secondaries are more numerous , but secondaries at larger distances are less likely to be detected because they are lost in the glare of their bright primaries @xcite . as a result , only a small fraction of stellar pairs with secondaries will be detected in a proper motion survey , even if their projected separations are as small as a few percent . since the lower limit of the detection limit of our ls pm - north ( @x <n> @x.0 yr we report the results of a search for companions in close ( @xmath0 pc ) , high proper motion binaries .<n> we find pairs with projected orbital separations in a range of distances between 15 pc and 30,000 au , which extends beyond the canonical upper limit for wide binary systems @xcite . while our sample spans only 1.3 orders of magnitude in @math1 , we are sensitive to a larger range of projected angular separations and the majority of our pairs are found in relatively close systems . we find that the distribution in absolute magnitude and distances of the cpm secondaries is quite different from that of the field population of single stars . in the magnitude limit of the lspm - north catalog ,<n> the secondaries are clearly dominated by m dwarfs , in other words they are of similar masses to their primaries . if we restrict our sample to pairs with separations less than the limiting magnitude of the _ hipparcos _ secondaries , the distribution of absolute magnitudes and distances is much more dependent on the distance of the pair . <n> binaries in which the primaries are main sequence stars or g dwarfs are very rare ; in fact , they are rare in general . we report the results of a search for wide ( @xmath0 ) hydrogen - burning cpm secondaries in a catalog of proper motion secondaries obtained with the hydra multi - object spectrograph on the wiyn telescope at kitt peak national observatory .<n> we find one new wide binary , and confirm the existence of two previously known wide binaries in our sample , both of which were previously known to be in a triple system . <n> the luminosity function of the secondaries is consistent with that of field stars , but it is significantly different from that of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood . in the magnitude distribution of the cpm<n> secondaries , we find a deficit of low - luminosity objects compared with the field luminosity function , indicating that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as secondaries than they are in the field population . if we assume that the formation mechanisms for wide binaries are biased against secondaries of very low mass or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries<n> , then we find that the absolute magnitudes of secondaries are correlated with mass , suggesting that wide binaries may be formed initially with both stars in a wide binary we report the results of a search for hydrogen - burning cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars north of the celestial equator with proper motion @xmath0 , parallaxes , and an accuracy of better than 10% .<n> we have determined that our northern - sky census was statistically complete for systems within 100 pc and proper motion ( yr@xmath1 ) of _ primaries _ , with luminosities of at least @xcite . from our sample of cpm pairs with primaries , we can now estimate the multiplicity fraction of wide binary systems in the solar neighborhood . we find that the probability for the disruption of wide systems is higher for lower - mass secondaries . <n> wide binaries are binaries in which the two or more stars in the orbit are separated in the same direction , but the separation is not equal to the projected , orbital separation between the components . in a wide binary system ,<n> the primary and secondary stars are drawn from the same mass function , so that gravitational interactions with the environment disrupt a number of systems over time . if one assumes that both components in wide binaries initially follow the field luminosity function <n> , then the ratio between the observed ( we present the results of a systematic search for wide multiples in the wide binary / multiple frequency distribution of stellar systems in the solar neighborhood , based on a sample of _ hipparcos _ objects with distances @xmath0pc .<n> we find that wide binaries / multiples with separations in excess of 10 au are present in at least half of all stellar systems with a typical primary star , i.e. a typical , nearby star . more specifically , we show that the fraction of wide binaries with separation @xcite is valid for systems in which the primary is a g dwarf with absolute magnitude in the range of magnitudes of the wide binaries observed in the literature . <n> binary stars are the most common stellar system in the galaxy , and their formation and evolution is a key factor in our understanding of the evolution of the solar system . in particular<n> , the formation of close binaries is believed to be a result of the gravitational instability of stars , while wide binaries are thought to be formed by the merger of two stars that have gained angular momentum due to the gravitational attraction of each other . the majority of stars in wide binaries ,<n> however , do not form this way , as we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars .<n> we find no evidence for cpm companions , and set an upper limit to the fraction of wide pairs that is consistent with _ pik s law_.<n> if one believes that star formation processes initially yield a distribution of wide binary systems , then our data reveals the range of maximum extension of the law . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : binaries : general open clusters and associations : individual ( ngc1333 , ic 348 ) . we report the results of our search for wide companions to _ hipparcos _ stars in the large synoptic survey north ( lspm - north ) .<n> we find that the observed luminosity function of the faint secondaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity functions of the field , single star population . in particular ,<n> the secondaries are dominated by fainter k - m dwarfs , while fainter , lower - mass companions clearly dominate over companions of similar masses and luminosities . <n> the observed distribution of projected separations is consistent with _ pik s law _ ( @xmath0 ds ) for systems with orbital separations up to a projected separation of @ x@xmath1 au . beyond that range , the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a power law , with the break occurring as interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they are formed . common proper motion ( cpm ) binaries have been identified among stars with proper motions ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) in the ucac2 catalog of @xcite .<n> the cpm companion of each star has a distance measured in 100 parsecs and is at least 5 milliarcseconds from the star in proper motion . <n> the orbital separations of cpm companions of _ hipparcos _ stars can be as small as a fraction of an arcsecond . we present the results of a survey for variable stars using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> we find that the fraction of variable stars with blue colors is higher in the subgiant branch than in the giant branch , and that the majority of the variable stars are blue . <n> the variable star fraction is found to depend strongly on the inclination of the source , with blue variable stars having a higher percentage of tilted tails than red variable stars of the same intrinsic colours . in the high inclination channel ( @xmath0 )<n> the fraction is highest for blue variables , while in the low inclination channel , it is lowest for red variables . the subdwarf density at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath0 ) is found to increase with the distance from the centre of the host galaxy , contrary to the expected decrease due to galactic rotation .<n> this may be due to the higher mass of the stars in the host galaxies , or to the fact that the stars are more massive and therefore have larger radii at higher densities . in any case , the increase in density increases the probability that a sub - millimetre source will be detected in the survey . <n> stars : low - mass x - rays : general galaxies : star formation the subdwarfs discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are found to be predominantly old and metal - poor .<n> this is in contrast to the findings of the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , which show a wide range of ages , from a few hundred myr to a billion years . <n> the discovery of old , metal - rich dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies is a major step forward in our understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe . however , many dwarf galaxies discovered so far are too old to have formed in the big bang , and many more are in a post - big - bang stage , where the metallicity of the interstellar medium has yet to be fully understood . in order to understand the formation of the first stars and galaxies , it is important to study the chemical enrichment of the ism in the early universe , especially in the sub - dwarf phase , during the early stages of its evolution . the chemical abundances of the gas and dust in dwarf galaxies can be used to determine the initial chemical composition of the early ism , as well as we present first results from a survey of subdwarf gravitational lensing by extragalactic sources detected with the _ einstein _ and _ chandra _ x - ray telescopes .<n> the fraction of the total sky covered by lensing is found to increase with source redshift , with more than half of the objects with redshifts @xmath0 showing lensing signatures . <n> the number density of sub - chandra / einstein sources ranges from 10@xmath1 to 10@xx , depending on the source , and the total number of detected sources is estimated to be at least 100 , based on the data from the hubble deep field north . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the formation of gravitational lensed systems , due to the possibility of using them as natural laboratories to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and their interactions with the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . at present , most lensing studies are focused on sources detected in the gravitational redshift range of a few to a few hundred , but there are also a number of gravitationally lensed sources detected at higher redshift<n> . some of these sources are likely to we present the results of a survey for subdwarfs and their host galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> the survey covers a total area of @xmath0 arcmin@xmath1 , including both point - like and extended objects . in most cases , the number of detected objects is higher than expected from the expected number of quasars and other point sources . however , we find that a large fraction of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is due to sub - dwarfs , and that the fraction may be higher in some cases than expected . <n> galaxies : clustering ; x - rays : general ; stars : kinematics and dynamics ; dark matter ; sub - luminosities ; ism we show that the gravitational redshifts of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) can be used to measure the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) .<n> we find that cvs with masses in the range @xmath0m@xmath1 are easily detected by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and can therefore be used as standard candles to probe bh masses in extragalactic systems . <n> the mass range of bhs that can be probed with the hst is much wider than that of the standard candles , and therefore cvs can provide a powerful probe of bh mass . in the standard model ( sm ) of the galaxy , the bh mass is assumed to be unity . however , recent observations have shown that many cvs are found to have masses below this minimum value , which raises the question of whether the sm is accurate enough to probe their masses accurately . here<n> we report observations of cvs that have been used to test the sm and find that most cvs have masses that are too low to be measured by the sm , but are still detectable by the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) at we show that the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , which are believed to be powered by accretion from a compact object , can be strongly affected by the accretion - driven wind from the accreting star .<n> if the accretion rate is high enough , the wind can ionize and heat the star , and the hmxb may be driven into a state of ionization equilibrium with the ambient medium . in such a case ,<n> the mass - loss rate can be as high as @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . <n> accretion onto compact objects , such as stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) and x - rays binaries ( xrbs , with low - mass companions ) is believed to occur through a combination of two processes : ( i ) accretion of matter onto the central object ; and ( ii ) angular momentum transport due to the wind . during accretion onto a bh , a large fraction of its mass is lost in the first stage of the process , while during the second stage , most of the mass is retained in the system , at least to the extent that the bh is still bound",

matter interaction , namely , the nakamura - chiorescu - harmans ( kovh ) interaction .<n> we have realized a system of two coupled two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) , each with a single - electron gas ( beg ) core , in a high - finesse gaas / algaas heterostructure . by applying a gate voltage<n> , we have created a gaas - algaa heterostructure with a high quality factor ( @xmath0 ) and a high density of states ( dos)@xmath1 . <n> light plays an important role in the development of modern technologies , such as semiconductor lasers @xcite , light emitting diodes ( ed ) @x<n> . however , it is also known that light interacts with matter in a non - linear way , which has led to the discovery of a number of new phenomena . among them , there is a new kind of interaction that has been recently discovered , known as the katsumura -chiorescu ( kch ) or the kovacovic - levitov ( we report on the experimental realization of a two - component bose - einstein condensate of bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 pairs confined in a harmonic trap .<n> the atoms are confined to a two dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , and the interaction between the bosonic modes is described by a time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . in a recent paper @xcite , we reported the experimental observation of a 2d bose _ einstein _ condensate ( bec ) of bosons trapped in a 1d harmonic potential @x<n> . the condensate was observed to form a ring - like structure , with a diameter of about 1 mm , centered on the position of the center of mass of the bosons . <n> the experimental results are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions , showing that the bec can be created in a controlled way . since the first theoretical prediction of the existence of a bec by johnson , bishop , chow , frunzio , majer , koch , girvin , & schoelkopf , the field of bec has been the subject of intense theoretical we study the ground state properties of the tian - lloyd model on the simple cubic lattice .<n> it is found that the model has two types of ground states . in the first type of ground state ,<n> the system is in a dimerized state and the dimerization energy is much lower than that of the second type of state . for large values of the lattice constant @xmath0 , the system undergoes a first - order transition from the dimerized to the non - dimerized phase , which is in agreement with recent experiments . <n> recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of the phase diagram and the properties of some molecules in the periodic and quasi - periodic potentials @xcite . among them , it is of great interest to understand the behavior of molecules in potentials which are close to the so - called second - order phase transition ( sopt ) , i.e. , where the energy gap between the first and the second order ground states of the system vanishes and the system enters into the ising - like universality class . on the other hand , in the presence of an external parameter , such as temperature or pressure , there is we study the dynamics of a dissipative two - level system in the strong coupling regime .<n> we focus on the time evolution of the steady - state distribution function , @xmath0 , of the reduced density matrix , and show that it is described by a generalized caldeira - leggett ( gl ) equation . by numerically solving the gl equation<n> , we find that the steady state is characterized by the existence of an infinite number of metastable states , whose number depends on the coupling constants and on the strength of the dissipation . <n> the study of quantum many - body systems is one of the most active areas of research in modern physics @xcite . in this context ,<n> the concept of dissipation is of central importance , as the system - environment interaction leads to the loss of coherence and fluctuation of the system s state . as a consequence , in the regime of strong dissipation , typical experimental features of a quantum system , such as the thermalization and the emergence of a steady state , can not be directly observed . on the other hand , quantum dynamics , where the system is in contact with its environment , exhibits a number of interesting features , we present a new approach to the study of the quantum statistical properties of a bose - einstein condensate in an optical trap .<n> the method is based on the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the condensate in the presence of an external magnetic field . using this method<n> , we derive a closed - form expression for the distribution of the number of atoms in the trap , as a function of time , for arbitrary values of the interaction strength . <n> the quantum statistics of light has been the subject of considerable interest during the past few years @xcite . in this context ,<n> the bloch - siegert ( bs ) equation , a generalization of the well - known louisell - shannon ( mv ) equations , has been used to study the quantum properties of light . the bs equation describes the interaction of a two - level system with an external field @xmath0 , which is the sum of two components : a mean - field component and a gaussian - like contribution from the mean - free - path of the system . here<n> we present an alternative derivation of the exact solution of this equation ",

jets is important for lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) searches at the lhc , as well as for the search for new physics effects in the gluon sector of the standard model ( sm ) . at the tevatron @xcite ,<n> a signal was found in the invariant masses of the jets in the forward region of the event , with a large double peak in the transverse momentum distribution , which was interpreted as evidence for the presence of a higgs particle with a mass above the sm prediction . in the slac linear collider ( lc ) at cern , a much larger signal was observed in the same transverse momentum region , but with a much smaller double peak , suggesting that the origin of the signal is different from what was predicted by the sm . with the upgraded lc detector , it will be possible we present an analysis of the dijets in @xmath0 collisions at 13 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and compare it with the analysis of jets at the fermilab tevatron .<n> the analysis is performed in full qcd with the monte - carlo event generators pythia andburner . <n> the study of dijet events at the lhc is important for two reasons . on the one hand ,<n> the large amount of data allows us to perform detailed studies of the properties of the jets , which can be used to constrain the kinematics of the central rapidity region of the collision , as well as the transverse momentum of the leptons in the lepton - pair - creation process @xcite . in particular , it is possible to disentangle the contribution of the leading jet from that of the next - to - leading jet , to obtain better constraints on the jet model parameters , such as couplings , masses , mixing angles , etc.,@xcite on the basis of the combined analysis of all the available dijet data , including the results from the slac linear collider , the t in this talk , we discuss the comparison of the drell yan production in the @xmath0 , @x , , and models with multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) .<n> it is shown that these models can be better tested in the context of the ue analysis . <n> [ cols= \"  \" ,<n> ] in the last two years , the tevatron experiments have collected a large amount of data on the production of the top quark and the bottom quark in proton - antiproton collisions at the center - of - mass energies of tev . in the proton - proton collisions , there are @xcite three types of measurements : drell - yan ( dy ) measurements , heavy quark ( hq ) and anti - quark production measurements ( hq ) as well as single and double parton ( dp ) production measurements . the dy and hq measurements have been reported by atlas and cms , respectively , while the hq and dp measurements are reported by the cms and atlas collaborations . for the hq and dy production , both atlas and we present a combined analysis of jet multiplicity in @xmath0 collisions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the analysis is performed in full qcd at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant , and includes contributions from the full set of jets in the initial state , as well as those produced in the quark and gluon stages of the sfermionization of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and in the subsequent decay of the lsp into a higgs boson and a jet . <n> we present an analysis of the jet multiplicity distribution in the lepton+jet final state in the framework of the minimal susy standard model @xcite . in this model ,<n> the leptons and jets are generated in the same way as the quarks and gluons in the standard model : they are produced at the top quark energy , are confined to the top of the lepto - jet pair and are subsequently allowed to propagate through the rest of the hadronically decaying lepton and jet system . as a result  we perform a monte carlo study of particle production in _ z _ and _ p _ collisions at the lhc in the framework of the mpi model .<n> we find that mpi significantly affects the production of particles in the low transverse momentum region , which is very difficult or even impossible to access with tevatron data . while such a low @xmath0 region is experimentally difficult or difficult to access , it is clearly a very sensitive region for mpi tuning and data with mpi cuts as low as possible are very interesting . <n> one of the most interesting topics in the study of supersymmetry ( susy ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the minimal susy model ( mssm ) @xcite , the susy breaking scale is set by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs boson , and the mass of the lightest neutralino is given by the sm value . as a consequence , sparticle production is very sensitive to the vevs of the neutralinos : while the sm prediction for the lightest we report on the use of the monte - carlo event - by - event generator sherpa to generate dihadron ( @xmath0 ) , diphoton , e-@xmath1 , and drell - yan / z - boson events at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies . <n> monte carlo ( mc ) event - generation tools are essential tools for the analysis of the data from the lhc experiments , especially for the measurement of the boson transverse momentum distribution , which is a key observable for understanding the properties of qcd matter at high energy .<n> however , mc events are subject to various sources of systematic error , such as the treatment of shower profiles , the choice of the mc event - selection criteria , as well as the choice and size of the shower duration . in this letter<n> , we will report on herpa , a new event - generator for mc events generated with the event - shaper , for the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron @xcite . for the first time , event generation tools based on mc are used to study the transverse momentum and mass distribution the d0 experiment at the fermilab tevatron collider has measured cross sections for the processes z / gamma+jets+x ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) and e+e- + x ( e,e,x , z , gamma ) produced in p - p collisions at the center - of - mass energy s**(1/2 ) = 1.96-tev .<n> the results are compared with the corresponding data from the cern sps and rhic energies . <n> * introduction . * in a series of publications @xcite , d0 ( d = dnf ) collaboration has reported measurements of the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) of inclusive and differential cross sections ( dc ) for several processes ( z - gamma , jet , x , e- , and e-+x ) , produced in proton anti - proton ( proton - proton ) collisions at s*(1/2)=1.96-mev , using data collected by the d experiment . in this letter<n> , we present the comparison of the results obtained by d0 with those obtained by the",

robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with negligible curvature ) as well as the evolution of gravitational waves . here ,<n> we study how the background affects gw spectra  we study the spectrum of gravitational waves ( gws ) in the context of general relativity ( gr ) .<n> we introduce polarization tensors into the einstein -

driven phase transition in the early universe are discussed .<n> we show that , in the presence of relativistic particles , the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the spectrum at the horizon entry of the gw is directly related to the equation of state at the onset of inflation , and can be used to probe the physics in the very early universe . <n> _ introduction._@xmath0 if the universe underwent a phase transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion in the recent past , it was pointed out @xcite that the spectrum of gravitational waves at the epoch of the transition could be very different from that in the present universe due to the anisotropic stress caused by the vacuum polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . in order to reveal the nature of this anisotropy , future space - based gw detectors such as _ planck _ and _ agile _ will be most sensitive to the high - frequency part of the gravitational wave spectrum , where the spectral index @xmath1 is expected to be close to unity . the _ gravitational wave space telescope _ ( _ gwgs  we study the backreaction of dark radiation on gravitational waves ( gws ) in the robertson - walker ( rd ) and minimal - density ( md ) universes .<n> we show that the rd and md universes have different backreaction effects on the gw spectrum . in the case of rd universe ,<n> the overall normalization of the spectrum is suppressed by the presence of the  dark radiation , '' which may be massive and/or non - interacting relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of our interest . on the other hand , in the md universe<n> , the evolution of the total energy density of the universe is not affected by the dark radiation due to the anisotropic stress at the horizon entry in the universe . <n> dark radiation ( dark matter ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , and it has been studied extensively in order to explain the origin of dark energy and dark matter ( dm ) . however , it is not clear whether the dm and dark radiation are interacting or not @xcite . also , there is no direct evidence for the existence of dm or dark we study the gravitational waves ( gws ) produced by a wimp dark radiation ( rd ) scenario , which is an extension of the standard model of particle physics .<n> we show that , in the case of the rd universe , the wimp dark energy ( i.e. , dark matter and dark radiation ) dominates the total energy density of the universe and the amount of dark radiation is very small . in this case<n> , we find that the gw spectrum is suppressed by the effect of rd radiation . <n> the wimp ( electron - positron ) dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most attractive candidates for the cold dark matter(cdm ) which is needed to solve the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) problem and to explain the origin of structure formation ( cf ) in the early universe @xcite . among the wimp models ,<n> the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm)@xcite is the most promising due to its naturalness , low - energy physics , and the possibility to directly test the nature of the dark matter . however , it has been pointed out by several groups that the wimps do inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) are sensitive to the thermal history of the universe .<n> thus they can be used to probe the history of inflation . in this paper<n> , we calculate the spectrum of the inflationary gw , taking account of the effects of anisotropic stress , and discuss its basic features . <n> inflation is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , because it can naturally account for the currently observed cosmological parameters , such as the hubble constant @xmath0 , the amplitude of gravitational waves , as well as the cmb anisotropy and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) . among the extensions ,<n> the simplest one is the so - called minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) with a non - abelian gauge symmetry , which is characterized by a compactified gauge group and a higgsino - like scalar field . for the successful realization of the minimal supersymmetry ( susy ) and the cp - violation in the sm , it is important to understand the origin of the sparticle content , in particular , that of the higgs sector . the inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) are sensitive to the thermal history of the universe .<n> thus they can be used to probe the phase transition , entropy production and dark radiation . in this paper , we show that the ratio of the gw frequency at the cosmic time at the transition to that at the horizon scales as @xmath0 , which is independent of the symmetry breaking potential , the equation - of - state parameter of the scalar field responsible for inflation , and the duration of the inflationary period . <n> inflation @xcite can drive a phase transition in the universe by breaking the scale invariance of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ; for example , in the standard inflationary scenario , a period of inflation is followed by a transition from the vacuum energy to the inflationary energy density . as a result ,<n> the primordial power spectrum has a bump just before the transition ; the amplitude of the bump is proportional to the hubble parameter at the time of the transition and it increases with time . on the other hand , if the symmetry is broken by a non - abelian symmetry , e.g. , by the presence of an extra scalar field , we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation - driven phase transitions .<n> we show that , if the duration of thermal inflation is long enough , there is an oscillation in the gw spectrum just before the phase transition , which is from the fact that entropy production occurs at a certain time . after the oscillation<n> is over , the spectrum scales as @xmath0 for the mode entering the horizon at the non -

suited for studies of cosmology , especially in the context of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , where the density of matter is comparable to that of dark energy . for a long time<n> it has been believed that the bbn is the origin of the observed large scale structure of the universe , but this idea has recently been called into question @x if dark matter is the dominant component of the universe , then dark radiation will be produced by the decay of dark matter .<n> we study the decays of dark radiation produced by two types of particle dominance . in the first case<n> , the dominant particle dominates the universe and decays into dark radiation , while in the second case it does not , but decays in a characteristic way . <n> dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite , and it has been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and experimental work in the last two decades . despite the tremendous effort ,<n> the dm puzzle is still unsolved . to find the exact mechanism of dm dark radiation<n> is still an unsolved problem . at the same time , there is a general consensus that if dm exists , it should be non - baryonic , which means that its equation of state ( eos ) should not be baryon - rich ( @xmath0 ) , leptonic or photon - rich , since these eos are required to explain the current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) we study the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) in the @xmath0 supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) . in this model ,<n> the lightest cp -

to - scalar ratio in the early stages of the cosmological evolution .<n> we show that it is determined by the time at which the horizon exits the inflationary era , and not by the primordial value evaluated at the time after the horizon exit . <n> [ [ section ] ] in a recent paper @xcite , we have shown that in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , the primordial tensor to scalar ratio is given by the universal power spectrum ( wsr ) of scalar perturbations . in this paper<n> we will show that this result can be generalized to the case of tensor perturbations in the presence of tensor modes . as an example we will consider tensor modes of perturbations with wavenumbers which go far out of the horizon , but which re - enters the horizon because of the exponential growth of the scale factor . here ,<n> in the present form of the spectrum , it will be expressed in terms of fourier - transformed perturbations of the wavenumbers of the perturbation , which are constant until they re - enter the horizon and hence are constant in time outside the horizon ( prim ) . on the other hand  we study a possibility that gravitational waves ( gws ) from inflation leave the horizon at different epochs .<n> we show that the effective energy - momentum tensor of inflationary gw s has a minimum at the time when the horizon exits at the rd era , and that the minimum tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath0 at that time . as a result ,<n> the tensor spectral index is larger than unity at the same time , which may have observable consequences . <n> the observation of gravitational waves from inflation @xcite is one of the most important observational tests of inflation . in the standard model of the early universe ( sm )<n> , it is expected that the primordial curvature perturbations , the so - called gravitational waves , are the sources of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the large scale structure ( lss)@xcite . on the other hand , in non - inflationary models of structure formation , such as gravitational waves of type ia supernovae ( snia ) and type ib / c supernovae(sn ) , they are the main sources of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao  primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) may have entered the horizon before the big bang and injected entropy into the early universe .<n> we show that the effective energy density and spectrum of inflationary gw s are sensitive to the presence of entropy injection : the higher the entropy injection rate , the larger the effective gw spectrum . for adiabatic , isocurvature perturbations<n> , we find that the spectral index of the tensor spectral index is @xmath0 . <n> the observation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies has established that the universe is currently in an expanding phase . in the standard cosmological model ( ccm ) ,<n> the hubble constant is proportional to the scale factor , and the cmb is filled with baryonic matter and radiation . however , it is not clear if the universe was filled with a perfect fluid at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite . if it is , then the universe may have been filled with an exotic form of matter called  dark energy . ''<n> dark energy is characterized by a negative pressure , a negative cosmological constant , as well as if the universe is filled with a perfect fluid at the present epoch , the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum may have a short period of thermal inflation .<n> the tensor - to - scalar ratio may be as large as @xmath0 at the end of the thermal inflation if the equation of state at the horizon is not too different from that at the beginning of the rd era . in this case ,<n> the present value of the present gw spectrum is proportional to the hubble parameter and the density parameter of the matter at the time of horizon entry . <n> _ introduction _ if the present universe is dominated by a cosmological constant , neutrinos would be nonrelativistic and their mass would be zero @xcite . as a result , there is a possibility that the universe may have had an early phase of accelerated expansion , called the  dark ages '' . at the same time , in the standard model ( mssm ) of particle physics , all neutrinos are massive and their masses are nonzero . the gw problem can be successfully solved by assuming that the dark ages are caused by the vacuum energy injected during the early period of the accelerated expansion @x we consider a scenario in which a brief period of thermal inflation is followed by a phase transition .<n> we show that the gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum at late time after the phase transition is proportional to @xmath0 , which is independent of the equation of state of the matter at the end of the thermal inflation . in the intermediate frequency region ,<n> the gw spectrum is also proportional to the inverse of the spectral index of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , and thus it can be used to distinguish different models of the early universe . <n> it is well known that the universe which is homogeneous and isotropic at the present time is in an early stage of evolution , called the minkowski spacetime . at the early stage , the universe is dominated by a cosmological constant ( qc ) , while at the late time the qc starts to dominate and the universe enters the matter dominated era ( md era ) @xcite . as the universe evolves , its energy density and the hubble parameter continuously increase , until the present value of the energy density is equal to the critical energy density , denoted as the reheating energy , at which the transition from the md era to we study the gravitational waves ( gws ) from a phase transition in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with matter dominated before thermal inflation .<n> we show that the gw spectrum has an oscillatory feature , which is caused by the additional  horizon exit '' and  entry '' processes of gw modes compared with other modes . in the intermediate frequency region ,<n> the spectrum is proportional to @xmath0 , where the ratio of matter energy density to the vacuum energy instantly goes to radiation after the phase transition . as a result , in the case where the universe is a frw universe , the amplitude of the spectrum in this region is roughly the same for different frequencies . <n> although the global picture of the gravitational wave spectral shape is well known , actually there appear oscillatory features in the gaussian gw spectral shape . here , we show more detail on these features . [<n> fig_pt_rd_twin ] _ introduction. _<n> _ it is well - known that the universe can be filled by  dark energy '' , i.e. , vacuum energy of the universe instantly goes we study gravitational waves ( gws ) produced by a phase transition in thermal inflation .<n> we find that the gw spectrum exhibits oscillatory features . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1([#1 ] ) if the universe is dominated by a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) before the phase transition , the spectrum of gravitational waves is expected to be nearly scale - invariant . on the other hand ,<n> if it was dominated by some other constant ( e.g. , vacuum - energy ) , their spectrum may be inhomogeneous . in the latter case<n> , there may be  bumps '' in the spectrum , which are caused by the oscillatory nature of the gravitational waves . as a result , in the case of thermal inflation the spectrum may have peaks or troughs , depending on the parameters of the model . #<n> 1@xmath1#1 there are two types of models for the early universe : @xcite one is the standard grand unified theory ( gut ) which is based on a single non - minimally - coupled higgs field , and we consider the possibility that gravitational waves ( gws ) at the phase transition in thermal inflation are damped by the vacuum fluctuations of the scalar field .<n> we show that in the case of md universe ( before thermal inflation ) and in the presence of a scalar field with a mass @xmath0 , the gw damping is so strong that the gap between two neighboring gw peaks is of the order of the hubble radius . in the md case ,<n> such a gap can be as large as several tens of microarcseconds . <n> _ introduction _ in a recent paper @xcite , we considered the possibility of gw damped oscillations at the cosmological phase transition during thermal inflation ( see also the text below ) , and showed that such a possibility can be realized in a simple model of inflation with scalar field ( see ref . 1 ) in the simplest version of this model , inflation is driven by a vacuum fluctuation of the field which is coupled to the gravitational field of the friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) spacetime . here<n> we consider a more general scenario , in which the vacuum fluctuation has a mass smaller than the mass of the frw we propose a new model of the late - time acceleration of the universe , in which the universe enters a new phase after thermal inflation . in this model ,<n> the universe starts from a decelerating phase , which is called the pre - big - bang ( p - b ) phase .<n> we show that the universe can reach the accelerated expansion phase after the transition from the p -b phase to the inflationary one . at the transition<n> , the universe is filled with a mixture of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryonic matter , and the hubble parameter is around @xmath0 . <n> recently , a lot of attention has been paid to the scenario of the early universe driven by thermal inflation ( tbi ) @xcite , where the universe begins from a non - accelerating phase before thermal inflation starts . after the phase transition , it takes a very long time for the universe to reach the radiation era , because the energy density in the universe before the thermal inflation is very high . on the other hand , when the universe goes to the radiation epoch , its energy density is much lower than that in the early era . as a result  we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be written as a sum of adiabatic and isocurvature terms .<n> the former is proportional to the energy density of the eos and the latter corresponds to the pressure of the dark matter in the universe . as a result ,<n> the transition from the dark to the baryonic energy takes place at a scale much larger than the horizon radius of the source , and the transition temperature from the radiation - dominated era to the dark - matter dominated one is of the order of the planck temperature . <n> the origin of the energy scale of the universe is one of the most fundamental problems in modern cosmology . in order to explain the recent cosmological observations , such as the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the galaxy , it is desirable to have an understanding of the mechanism of energy transfer from the early universe to the present epoch . to this end , we need to understand the nature of the so - called dark energy ( de ) , which is the essence of the standard model of particle physics  we propose a class of quintessence models in which the universe is filled with dark energy whose equation of state ( eos ) is given by @xmath0 . in these models ,<n> dark energy is non - relativistic and its energy density is proportional to the eos of the universe .<n> the spectrum of the density perturbations can be steeper than that of the cosmological constant , and the transition from the early to the late - time universe can be accelerated . <n> [ [ section ] ] in recent years , a lot of attention has been paid to the problem of the origin of the dark energy ( de ) , which is the dominant component of the energy density of our universe @xcite . the nature of de is one of the most important unsolved problems in cosmology . on the one hand , it has been suggested that the universe may be filled with a mysterious exotic matter called dark energy , whose energy density has to be much larger than the dark matter energy of the milky way ( mw ) because of the gravitational effects of the de , but this is in conflict with the observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by the wilkinson microwave aniso we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 can be expressed as the sum of adiabatic and isocurvature terms .<n> the former is proportional to the energy density of the universe while the latter gives the eos of dark energy in the early universe . as a result ,<n> we obtain the eo@xmath1 limit which is consistent with the recent result of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) collaboration . <n> dark energy ( de ) is one of the most attractive candidates for explaining the origin of the observed large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe , together with dark matter ( dm ) and baryons . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , dark energy is described by a cosmological constant @xcite , and it has been considered as a candidate for the dark matter . on the other hand , in the framework of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) model , the wimp can be regarded as a dark energy which is a mixture of cold and warm components . among various wimp candidates , quinn dark energy model ( quin we propose a new dark matter candidate , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , which can be stable against annihilation into dark matter and dark energy .<n> the wimp mass is determined by the wimp couplings to ordinary matter , and can be as large as @xmath0 tev . in this scenario ,<n> the primordial nucleosynthesis is naturally suppressed due to the annihilation of the wimp . on the other hand , in the leptonic sector , the lepton asymmetry is predicted to be large enough to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe without the need of dark matter . <n> dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most interesting topics in particle physics since it is the main component of the energy density in the universe . since the establishment of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , dm has been the main focus of cosmology and particle physics research . however , it is well known that the origin of dm is still an unsolved problem . among various dark matter candidates , there is a candidate named wimp ( or sneutrino ) which has we propose a new mechanism for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( gut ) .<n> the mechanism is based on the introduction of a new right - handed ( inverted ) fermion , the sneutrino , with a mass around the gut scale , @xmath0 tev , and a sfermion yukawa coupling to the neutrinos , which breaks susy invariance and leads to the bao with a bao of the order of the planck scale . <n> * introduction . *<n> the baryon number asymmetry ( bna ) is a direct manifestation of the symmetries of the theory . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the bna is given by the ratio of the electron ( positron ) to the neutron ( anti - neutron ) number in units of the unitarity triangle , or , equivalently , by the number of baryons per unit volume in the universe @xcite . here , _<n> i.e. _ , we we propose a new mechanism for dark matter annihilation , based on the coupling of dark matter to the higgs field of the standard model of particle physics . in this scenario ,<n> the dark matter is accelerated to relativistic speeds and its energy density is boosted by higgs self - interactions .<n> we show that this mechanism naturally leads to a suppression of the energy density of higgs bosons in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , which can account for the excess of high energy neutrinos observed by the planck collaboration . <n> the discovery of neutrinos by the pierre auger observatory @xcite @xmath0 years after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provides the first direct evidence for the existence of a non - zero mass dark matter ( dm ) component in the universe . at the same time , it is clear that our universe is dominated by baryonic , leptonic and hadronic dark matter , the so - called dark energy , whose energy density has to be comparable to the kinetic energy of the baryons and leptons . as a consequence , dm is a viable candidate for the dark sector of the cosmic web , and the origin of the we show that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) can be expressed in terms of a single parameter @xmath0 , which is determined by the coupling constants of the dark matter ( dm ) to the standard model ( sm ) particles .<n> we also show that this eos can be written as the sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the hubble parameter of the sm , and the other is a function of the energy density of the dm in the early universe . as a result<n> , we find that the eos in the sm can be made arbitrarily small . <n> recently , the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy by the boomerang and wilkinson microwave anistropy probe ( wmap ) experiments has been reconsidered @xcite . in the cmb data ,<n> the temperature of the radiation is measured to be very close to zero , while in the wmap data the temperature is found to be as low as -40 k. the origin of this anisotropic cmb temperature is still an unsolved problem in cosmology . to solve this problem , it has been suggested that the origin we propose a new type of dark matter candidate , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .<n> we show that the wimp mass can be as low as @xmath0 gev if it is weakly interacting with the standard model ( sm ) particles and its dark matter ( dm ) constituents . in this scenario ,<n> the dm particles are weakly coupled to the wimps and the wimp - dm coupling can be made arbitrarily small by the combined effect of wimp overabundance and wimp decay into the sm particles . <n> the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) is the most natural candidate to explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the observable universe ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein )<n> . however , it suffers from a number of theoretical problems , one of which is the overabundance of neutralinos in the galactic halo , which can not be produced by the sm . as a result , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) has a very small mass , and its properties",

?<n> * chapter 9 ) and @xcite . in short , the initial @xmath0$]-supported variable of interest is transformed through the probit function into a variable whose support is unconstrained , and the density of that transformed variable is estimated and an estimate of the initial density on @xxmath1 $ ] is obtained by back - transformation . this method appears very natural and yields very good results , provided that the estimation step in the transformed domain is carried out with care , as the results in the simulation studies showed . extending the idea to the copula case<n> , this paper proposes and studies a new , kernel -type estimator for copula densities . it is , in probit - transformation back - estimation of the copula @xmath0 of the standard normal cdf of the gaussian copula on the real line is considered .<n> the main idea is to estimate the density of the vector of interest by back - transformation , that is , to obtain an estimate of its density on the transformed line . the asymptotic theory of the proposed estimators is developed , and the point of smoothing parameter selection is also addressed . <n> the estimators are asymptotically ( i.e. asymptotically ) equal to the product of two copula density estimators , one of which is the usual normal copula and the other a copula of the joint cdf , as long as the latter has unconstrained support . in this case<n> , the former can be considered to be the probit transformation estimator , which yields very good results , provided that the estimation step in the transformed domain is carried out with care . as a consequence ,<n> it is shown that the two - copula - transformation estimators yield very good estimates of the density in the whole domain of interest , even in the presence of strong outliers . for the standard copula cdf<n> we introduce the notion of the gaussian copula , that is , the copula @xmath0 of a euclidean space which is invariant to an increasing transformation of its margins .<n> the idea is that , if the co - dimension of the euclidian space is not greater than a given threshold , one can estimate the density of a _ bona fide _ copula by estimating its density on the interior of a suitable lebesgue - a.e . <n> space . in this paper<n> , we prove that the joint copula density of such a copula is uniformly bounded , up to the second order , in the case of copulas with unbounded density . also , under mild assumptions , it is shown that the partial derivatives of the joint density are uniformly bounded as well , even in the cases of unbounded copula densities , provided that the dimension is at least two . the concept of _ dimension _ in statistics<n> was introduced by john hutchings in his celebrated book on statistics , * ?

called copula estimation , in which one estimates the density by a kernel density estimator , which is then transformed into the domain of interest . the copula approach , first proposed by gauss in the 1950 s , is based on the idea that the density should be estimated by a product of two univariate gaussian kernels , one for each data point , where the problem of estimating the probit - transformation kernel copula density in a transformed domain is considered .<n> it is shown that , under certain conditions , using pseudo - observations on the transformed domain does not affect the asymptotic properties of the  ideal ' local log - linear copula - density estimator . <n> [ [ section ] ] since the seminal work of shannon @xcite , the density estimation problem has been one of the main challenges in the theory of partial differential equations . in recent years<n> , there has been an explosion of interest in this problem , both from the theoretical side , as well as from the practical side . from a practical point of view ,<n> the problem is crucial for the design of robust and efficient algorithms for the estimation of the covariance matrix of log - transformed gaussian noise , and for the analysis of the corresponding lyapunov exponents @xmath0 . for this reason , in the last few years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of this problem in the nonlinear regime , where the nonlinearity is of the order of the inverse log - size . the main contribution of this work is the derivation we consider the problem of estimating the density of probit - transformation kernels in the @xmath0-domain from pseudo - observations .<n> we propose two estimators : the local log - linear and the standard kernel copula density estimators in the hat domain , and an improved  improved ' version of the probit density estimator in the standard domain . <n> we show that , compared to the  naive ' estimator , these two new estimators act on the boundary behaviour as well . in the case of the hat version ,<n> we derive a closed - form expression for the density estimator and show that it improves on the basic kernel estimator by adjusting for the local slopes . as a consequence , it is automatically free from any unbounded terms . [ [ section ] ] density estimation is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory @xcite , with applications ranging from quantum key distribution ( qkd ) to quantum teleportation ( qm ) and entanglement distillation ( e.g. , in quantum error correction ( eec ) , entanglement generation ( eig ) or quantum metrology ) @x . the density estimation problem is , however , notoriously difficult to solve the problem of approximating the density of non - negativecopendentcopden sets is considered .<n> it is shown that the usual local log - linear estimator can be made asymptotically unbiased by using a suitable  local ' polynomial differentiation . a new cross - validation criterion<n> is introduced to select the polynomials to be transformed , and two new density estimators are derived . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / + + _ introduction : _ non - positivecopdens @xcite are nontrivial examples of chaotic systems , arising in many areas of science and engineering , such as biology , chemistry , physics , acoustics , materials science , computer science and bioinformatics . in this paper<n> , we consider the estimation of the density @xmath0 of a nonnegativecopden set , that is , the set of all non - zerocopden pairs of co - compactly supported conformal maps of the unit interval , from a given data set . for a given set of maps ,<n> the density is defined as the maximum of the covariance matrices of the maps ; this is a fundamental problem in non - linear algebra  estimators of the copula density , a central quantity in density functional theory , play a central role in many areas of science and engineering .<n> it is well known that local log - quadratic probit - transformation kernel copula - density estimators are asymptotically unbiased , that is , they achieve the optimal rate of convergence as the bandwidth increases . here<n> we show that this is not the case for non - local ( non - quadratic ) transformations . for these transformations ,<n> the optimal bandwidth order is shown to be @xmath0 , which is slightly stronger than the order of convergence for local transforms . as a result<n> , we obtain a new class of estimators that are unbiased at any bandwidth , in contrast to all previously known local transformations that are biased at any order . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of estimating the density of a quantum state is central to many fields of physics , including quantum metrology , quantum information processing , and quantum optics @xcite . in this context , estimation of copula densities is of crucial importance , as they are the only non - linear density functionals that can be used to estimate the state s density  density estimation in the @xmath0-domain is known to be biased when approaching the boundary of the domain . here<n> , we show that this bias can be significantly reduced by fitting a local log - quadratic polynomial .<n> this is achieved by combining probit transformation and local polynomial modelling . <n> density estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in statistical physics , which has been the subject of intense research in the last two decades @xcite . in this context ,<n> the main difficulty is related to the following : * ? ?<n> * theorem [ eqn : theorem]*theorem * : fshat ] and assumption [ ass : assumption4 ] : @xmath5 here , the density of a sample of size _ at most _ , @x , is given by the product of the mean squared error ( mse ) of a covariance matrix associated with the density estimator and the variance of the estimator . for the sake of clarity , here<n> we only consider the case where the sample size is the sum of two terms : the first one is proportional to the variance , and the second one is a probit transformation and local log - quadratic density estimation in the @xmath0-domain are shown to reduce the boundary bias problem for copula density estimation .<n> in addition , a cross - validation method is suggested to choose the bandwidth matrix in such a way that the bias reduction is automatic . <n> density estimation is one of the most important problems in statistics , where it is crucial to estimate the density of a mixture of variates as accurately as possible while keeping the mean squared error ( mse ) as small as possible . in practice<n> , one typically has to estimate this mixture in a copula form , e.g. using a beta kernel , or alternatively , estimate it using a multivariate estimator , such as the bernstein estimator @xcite . for the latter ,<n> the main difficulty is that the variance of the estimator tends to grow unboundedly when approaching boundaries , which can lead to interpretability issues and computational burden . as a result , there are a number of bias reduction methods proposed in the literature , see for instance * ? ?<n> * chapter 4 , * chapter 5 * , and *<n> chapter 6 * . here<n> we will focus on the problem of estimating the copula density of a density field in a transformed domain is considered .<n> the main focus is on correcting for the bias introduced by the boundaries between the transformed and the original domains . in the univariate case<n> , we show that a simple adjustment of the nearest - neighbor bandwidth can stabilise the variance of the estimators towards the boundaries . for the gaussian kernel ,<n> the same bandwidths are shown to be equally effective . <n> the estimation of copulas in transformed domains has received a lot of attention in the recent literature @xcite , see for instance the chapter * ? ?<n> * chapter 4 , as well as the references therein . the main contribution of this paper is to provide a correction to the boundary bias in the estimator of the density field @xmath0 in the transformed domain . here<n> we deal with univariate and non - univariate density estimators , in the case where the domain can be transformed either to a fixed or to a transformed set of boundaries , respectively . to estimate<n> the density , one needs to take into account the proportion of observations actively entering the estimation process out of the sample , or equivalently , the probit - transformation kernel copula density estimators ( pde ) are widely used in many areas of science and engineering .<n> however , they have been shown to be subject to a number of fundamental limitations , such as the existence of spurious bumps . in this paper<n> , we introduce a new class of pde which we call  improved pde ' , which we show to be free of these limitations . <n> pde are based on the observation that the copulas associated with the transformed matrix , in the domain of interest , are _ independent _ of the transformation matrix . as a consequence ,<n> they are free of interpolation errors and , more importantly , do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality : they do not depend on the choice of bandwidth matrix ; they are independent of the sample size ; and they are much smoother in the tails than their fixed - bandwidth counterparts , especially in the case of high - dimensional systems . moreover , compared to standard pde methods , it is much more stable along the boundaries : this is achieved through the use of unconstrained bandwidth matrices , avoiding the occurrence of  spurious bumps ' . * we present a simple and effective approach to the estimation of the true copula density in one - dimensional euclidean space .<n> it is based on the use of local log - quadratic modelling , which allows a reduction of the bias order by a factor @xmath0 , that in turn allows a larger smoothing parameter to be used . in particular , we show that estimators based on this approach are remarkably good at recovering the shape of the underlying copula , while maintaining a visually pleasant amount of smoothness . <n> * key words : * copulas , bias order reduction , real -

general.cfg , , we consider the problem of estimating the two - point density function @xmath0 in two dimensions from observations .<n> it is well known that , in contrast to estimating the density of a single point , estimation of the density from observations of different points is in general not trivial . in this paper<n> , we propose a general procedure for estimating @x , based on a bandwidth matrix , which is optimal for univariate estimation , optimal for bivariate estimation and asymptotically optimal for two - dimensional estimation . <n> estimation of density functions is an important problem in many fields , such as biology , econometrics , statistics , and traffic forecasting @xcite . for estimating density functions ,<n> one needs to estimate the mean density , or equivalently , the  density of interest ' , of the subset of the observations that contain the information on the density function . to estimate density functions from a set of observations , one usually needs to select a subset of them , for example , from the set of all the observations of interest that have the same density function ( see , e.g. , * ? ?<n> * section 5.3.3 ) . we propose a new class of estimators for univariate and local log - quadratic functions of density in two - dimensional euclidean space .<n> the estimators are based on a novel cross - validation procedure , in which the density estimator is built on the univariate log - linear function of the density , while the local quadratic function is estimated bivariately . in the case of univariate density estimation ,<n> the proposed estimators have close - to - optimal rates of convergence . <n> density functionals ( dfts ) are widely used in many areas of science and engineering , as they are the basis of a wide range of applications in biology , chemistry , physics , engineering and biology @xcite . despite their widespread use , however , there is still a lack of understanding of the role played by local geometry in the estimation of functionals of interest in these systems . for instance , it is well - known that local geometry does not necessarily ensure the correct normalization of the functionals , and that there is , indeed , a class of functions that can not be directly estimated from a given set of data . on the other hand , for functionals that are to be in this paper , we study the problem of optimal bandwidth selection in the setting of sparse nonlinear dynamical systems . we show that , in one and two dimensions , it is possible to select the bandwidth matrix in such a way that the underlying density is bivariate normal , that is , @xmath0 is the gaussian copula . in the fixed - bandwidth case ,<n> the same result is obtained .<n> we also show that it is not always possible to find the optimal  smoothing parameters ' in terms of the covariance structure of the density . <n> _ introduction : _ nonlinear dynamics , the study of the response of nonlinear systems , is an active area of research , with many branches of research in both theoretical and experimental biology . among the most important of these branches , and in spite of its wide range of applications , are the following : ( i ) modelling and prediction of the nonlinear response of biological cells @xcite ; ( ii ) the characterisation of the dynamical response of complex systems @x<n> ; and , most notably , ( iii ) characterization of the dynamic response of artificial neural networks ( ann ) @ monte carlo simulations results are presented to compare the practical behaviour of probit - transformation estimators with that of their main competitors . specifically , 12 estimators were considered : the  mirror reflection ' estimator , as suggested in @xcite , is the first attempt at nonparametric copula density estimation , and remains a common choice for ( ostensibly ) correcting boundary bias . it is , therefore , taken as benchmark . a first bandwidth matrix was obtained from the   augmented ' data set ( made up of @xmath0  observations ' spread over an area 9 times bigger than the area of interest ) via the normal reference rule , then the final matrix is obtained by multiplying the former by a correction factor , which depends on the effective sample size and range .<n> this technique , based on a twofold univariate cross - validation optimisation problem , was found to be more stable numerically than one based on optimising a full , bivariatecross - validation criterion . in addition ,<n> the suggested procedure , using a twofold , cross - validated optimisation problem ( optimised numerically , not univariate ) , seems to be an acceptable choice for selecting the bandwidth matrix in this note we show how probit - transformation matrices can be estimated from a multivariate data set , and how bandwidth selection can be done in such a way that the resulting matrix is close to optimal . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of finding a good probit transformation matrix @xmath0 for a given multivariate dataset @xcite is still not completely understood .<n> it is well - known that a matrix obtained from a  normal ' data set can be transformed into a matrix with better properties . on the other hand , in the case of univariate data sets ,<n> it has been shown that it is not always possible to find a good matrix to estimate the transformation properties of a given probit . in the univariate case , for example , it was already shown that the  naive ' estimators of the probit transformations performed well , but not very well in the multivariate case . here , we show that a simple amendment of the latter estimators performs much better , so that they can be considered as good candidates for estimating the probits in a multivariate dataset . as an example of an application of these new estimators ,  cross -

'' ] ] the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase . in the present article ,<n> the article aims at examining whether the assumption that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion ,' _ i.e. _ to insure that the transition matrix is  invariant .'' ] we find that this is not the case , with the result that the bounce does not have any significant effect on the large scales which are relevant for today s astrophysics . for a fixed fourier mode , we find @x we examine whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is independent of @xmath0 in the pre big bang perturbation spectrum calculations is generically valid . for this purpose , we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce . we choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref . <n> @xcite .<n> we do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase . therefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the expanding phase with flat spatial sections , _ i.e. _ as already considered in the literature . we study the propagation of gravitational waves ( tensor and scalar ) in a universe with a bounce , _<n> i.e. _ when the scale factor of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe is rescaled such that the curvature of the spatial sections vanishes at the bounce .<n> we show that in this case , gravitational waves are affected by the bounce in a qualitatively different way than in the case of scalar modes , and that the violation of the null energy condition is necessary to ensure the preservation of the spectrum of long wavelength modes . <n> the main goal of this article is to show that a bounce can be a useful tool to control the properties of the gravitational wave ( gw ) propagation . in particular , we are interested in the following question : does a bounce affect the propagation properties of gw modes ? <n> this question is relevant to a wide class of models , ranging from supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) to theories beyond the sm , such as string theory , grand unified theories ( gut ) , supergravity and more recently , extensions of so - called @xmath0-essence @x in this article , we present a new approach to the bouncing universe , based on the use of the null energy condition at the bounce .<n> this is achieved by the introduction of a real scalar field , which is responsible for the non - gaussian behavior of the scale factor . in the case of closed spatial sections ,<n> we show that the bounce can be described by the solution of the einstein equations with a single scalar field only , _<n> i.e. _ it can be a bounce of the form @xmath0 , where the field equation @xcite is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the square root of the hubble parameter . <n> the study of the evolution of the universe has reached a mature stage now , thanks to the accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the large scale structure ( lss ) , provided by the observations of the type ia supernovae ( snia ) and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) at the center of our galaxy , as well as to the improved description of the physics of the early universe obtained by means of the cosmological constant ( @x we show that the distance scales of cosmological interest now , as measured _ via _ the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , can be significantly perturbed by the presence of matter in the universe .<n> we find that , in this case , the perturbations of the metric and of the spatial sections of the three -

negligible cold dark matter ( cdm ) component , which in turn is responsible for the anisotropic behavior of the cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations , and for the large scale structure ( lss ) of the cosmic web @xcite . in order to account for the observations , however , one has to modify the standard model of particle physics , _<n> i.e. _ we have to assume that the quarks in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are not completely decoupled from the rest of the matter : in this paper , we we show that , in the framework of flrw cosmology , the evolution of the universe is determined by the deformation of the 3-sphere .<n> this deformation , being nothing but a global motion of the center of the @xmath0-sphere , is pure gauge mode and , from it , one can construct a master equation for the bardeen potential . in the matter sector ,<n> the deformation is described by two gauge - invariant quantities , called thebardeen potentials . for simple form of matter with no anisotropic stress ( this is the case for a scalar field ) , we find that the master equation is the same whatever the curvature of the spatial sections is . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.-k , 04.50.+h , 95.36.+x one of the most striking predictions of general relativity is that the spacetime of the early universe will be flat @xcite . since then , various cosmological models have been proposed . among them , friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models , which are closely related to einstein s theory of gravity , have been extensively studied we show that the einstein - klein - gordon equations can be used to study the dynamics of a scalar field in a curved space - time .<n> the scalar field is described by a bardeen potential , which can be identified with the hubble scale . in some regimes of the parameter space ,<n> the potential is equivalent to the sound velocity . <n> pacs numbers : 03.70.+k , 11.10.wx , 05.30.-d , 51.10.+y , 52.35.ra in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the study of quantum effects in curved spacetime @xcite . at present , this interest is mainly due to the possibility of using these effects in the context of quantum information processing , for example in the formulation of quantum error correction codes . the standard model of particle physics<n> is based on the gravitational interaction between two particles , one of them being a bosonic field , the other being a fermionic field ; the interaction is supposed to be short - ranged and repulsive , so that the fermions can be treated as classical particles . for a description of the interaction , it is it is shown that , in the limit of a vanishing cosmological constant , a parametric oscillator equation of motion can be derived for the modes of the laplace - beltrami operator .<n> the form of the equation is very different from the usual one , and has the traditional form of an equation of the parametric oscillator , _ i.e. _ of a _ mode number _ , which is , indeed , much smaller than unity in any inflationary scenario . in the present context<n> , we are particularly interested in the case of a universe that is almost flat . <n> pacs : 04.20.jb , 98.80.cq , 11.27.+d it is now well - established that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , with the current value of the hubble parameter , @xmath0 , close to its historical and cosmological high values . at the same time , there is mounting observational evidence that the density of matter in the universe , as measured by the cmb anisotropy , is significantly lower than that predicted by the standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model @xcite  inflationary cosmology is studied in the framework of quantum cosmological perturbations .<n> it is shown that , in general , initial conditions that are well - motivated in the context of quantum cosmology are not easily obtained in the presence of cosmological curvature . in particular , it is not possible to set up initial conditions in the inflationary regime _ without _ introducing a non - trivial term in the effective potential . <n> inflation is one of the most striking manifestations of the quantum - mechanical origin of gravitation . at present<n> , there is a consensus that inflation is the _ only _ viable mechanism to explain the present acceleration of the expansion of the universe , _<n> i.e. _ it can not be due to the vacuum energy associated with quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field of the scale factor @xmath0 , or , more generally , of the vacuum gravitational field itself , which is , indeed , the  only '' non - vanishing degree of freedom in the quantum theory of gravity . the inflationary paradigm @xcite is based on the idea that the energy density associated with a vacuum energy of the order of the hubble constant is the cosmological constant of the present epoch , and we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a bouncing phase of accelerated expansion .<n> this phase corresponds to a de sitter - like period in the history of the universe , and is preceded by a period of decelerating expansion , which is followed by a bouncing epoch in which the scale factor oscillates around its minimum value . in this bouncing phase ,<n> the perturbations can be decomposed into adiabatic and isocurvature components , with the latter corresponding to a scale that grows linearly with the wave number . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 04.50.+h , 95.35.+d it has been known for some time now that the standard model of particle physics , in the form of a homogeneous and isotropic scalar field , is inadequate to describe the behavior of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation at the present time . at the same time , there is growing evidence that our universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion that started with a big - bang singularity @xcite . as a consequence , the scale of the initial fluctuations of the scalar field is expected to be smaller than its present value @xmath0 . we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the bouncing universe scenario .<n> we show that , contrary to inflation , there is no fundamental reason why the equation of state should be close to vacuum , so that the scale factor of a bouncing universe can behave in a very similar way to that of an inflationary universe . in particular , we find that the bounce characteristic conformal time @xmath0 is of the order of the planck time , _<n> i.e. _ much smaller than the plank time . <n> cosmology is one of the most studied subjects in modern physics . at present<n> , it is widely accepted that our universe is dominated by an inflationary phase , which is characterized by a nearly scale - invariant equation - of - state @xcite . on the other hand ,<n> much is still unknown about how the universe evolves from a non - inflationary state to the present day , and about the nature of the perturbations which are responsible for that evolution . among the most promising candidates for the latter<n> is the so - called  bouncing universe '' scenario , in which the initial state of the universe is much more complicated than in the inflationary case : it is we present an expansion of the planck - scale potential for a scalar field in terms of its planck mass and planck coupling constant .<n> this expansion is based on a de sitter - like solution , and it is valid for a wide class of bounces , including de sitter and quasi - de sitter ones . in the strict de sitter limit ,<n> the potential has a constant value , but it oscillates with a very small amplitude around its central value . for more general bounces<n> , we find that the amplitude of the oscillation can be much larger than the potential s central value and is bounded below by a constant , independent of the conformal time of the bounce . <n> there is a growing interest in string theory and in extensions of it beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . among the simplest extensions , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )<n> is one of the most attractive , as it has the advantage of being able to solve the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) problem at the same time . within this class of models , _<n> i.e. _ , models with @x we present an exact solution to einstein equations with a scalar field in a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background .<n> the solution exhibits an inflationary phase with an equation of state @xmath0 , which is the exact counterpart of the inflationary de sitter solution . in the case of a de sitter like expansion ,<n> the initial conditions for the scalar field are identical to those of a constant scalar field potential , and the universe starts at either a maximum or a minimum of the potential . <n> .2 in the standard inflationary scenario , the expansion of the universe is driven by a phase of de sitter - like ( or quasi - de sitter ) expansion which ends in a big - bang singularity . at the bounce , _<n> i.e. _ , at the point where the scale factor vanishes , it is assumed that the energy density in the field is non - zero and that there is no more de sitter expansion : this is the so - called null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite . however , this condition can not be satisfied in the presence of an inflationary scalar field : indeed , in einstein we present a simple inflationary model in which the universe experiences a regular bounce .<n> we show that this scenario leads to an effective potential for density perturbations which is very simple even if the universe starts at a de sitter - like bounce : scalar perturbations can be amplified by only a nonvanishing amount . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 11.27.+d , 04.50.+h 2 recently , there has been a lot of interest in inflationary cosmology @xcite . among these models ,<n> one of the most attractive is given by the so - called @xmath0 model , in which inflation is driven by a scalar field . in this model<n> , it is shown that the universe can start from either an inflationary minimum or a maximum of the potential , depending on the initial conditions for the field , and it can end up in either of these regimes . for a specific choice of initial conditions , the model leads to a de - sitter bounce , i.e. , a smooth transition from a quasi - de sitter to a fully - inflationary expansion , with a non - vanishing amount of kinetic energy in the scalar field ( see fig . [ p we show that scalar perturbations can be amplified by bounces in the expansion of the universe .<n> such bounces can occur in the slow - roll approximation , in which case they are de sitter - like bounces . in this case , the bardeen potential mode oscillates while passing through the bounce , reflecting the nondomination of the potential at this point . as a result ,<n> the effective potentials for scalar density perturbations are modified , and the amplitude of the perturbations is increased . <n> inflation is one of the most attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , as it provides the seeds for the formation of structure , provides the initial conditions for the standard cosmological model ( cms ) and can be tested against observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and large scale structure ( lss , see e.g. refs . @xcite for a review of the current state of the cmb and other cosmological probes )<n> . however , inflation does not work in the standard way , i.e. it does not amplify perturbations by any amount . instead , it is usually assumed that the universe experiences slow - roll inflation is studied in the framework of a scalar field theory with a double expansion around a de sitter - like bounce . the scalar field potential and its first derivative at the bounce<n> are found to be proportional to @xmath0 .<n> the de sitter parameters are in a certain sense similar to the traditional slow - rolling parameters . <n> pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 11.10.lm , 12.60.jv + + keywords : inflation , scalar field , slow roll + + the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is based on the lagrangian @xcite . in its simplest form ,<n> it contains only two free parameters , the mass and the speed of light , which are the parameters of the scalar potential and of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , respectively . for inflation<n> , these two parameters must be non - zero , in order for the inflation to be stable and to be consistent with the predictions of the sm . to this end , it is natural to ask what happens to the free parameters when the initial conditions are modified , so that the new coupling constants are no longer constant we study the spectrum of a scalar field in a bounce .<n> we show that , if the bounce occurs at the minimum of the scalar field potential , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the spectrum and the bounce conditions . in the case of a symmetric bounce ,<n> the spectrum is determined by the einstein - klein - gordon equations . if , on the other hand , the bounce is not symmetric , then the field theory can not describe the spectrum . <n> pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 11.10.kk , 12.60.jv + + keywords : scalar - tensor gravity , field theory in bounces , spectrum of scalar fields the gravitational collapse of an initially flat space - time leads to the formation of a non - gravitational structure , a bounce or an event horizon @xcite . for a field theory to make sense , it is necessary to have a field theoretic description of the bounce and , as a consequence , to be able to describe its properties , in particular , its kinetic energy , @xmath0 , which is the quantity that most often comes to mind to describe the physics of we propose a new mechanism for the generation of primordial density perturbations in the early universe .<n> the mechanism is based on the existence of a bounce in the evolution of the universe due to the presence of a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of a scalar field . at the bounce<n> , the scalar field acquires a negative effective potential , and the vacuum becomes unstable . as a result ,<n> the amplitude of the perturbations is enhanced . in this paper , we show that this mechanism leads to a spectrum of primordial perturbations that can be generated in the context of the standard @xmath0 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite is the most studied and paradigmatic example of non - perturbative quantum field theory . despite its success in describing a large variety of physical phenomena , such as the quark and lepton condensates , superconductivity , dark matter , etc .@xcite , it suffers from a number of theoretical shortcomings . among these<n> is the lack of a natural mechanism to generate non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the vacuum state of the sm . we present a quartic approximation of the spatial section of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological model in which the curvature of the space - time is treated perturbatively .<n> we show that the curvature can be non - negligible right after the bounce and that it can strongly affect the subsequent evolution of the universe . in particular , we find that : ( i ) the bounce can be connected to a radiation - dominated era ; ( ii ) it can occur in a regime where the curvature is large compared to the hubble parameter ; and ( iii ) there is a region in the parameter space where this curvature can not be approximated by the first term of the taylor expansion . <n> the spatial sections of the flrw model have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite with the aim of finding out how they might be affected by the presence of matter and radiation in the early universe , and , if so , in what way they might evolve . among the different approaches that have been proposed ,<n> one of the most promising has been the so - called _ flrw bounce _ , which is based on the idea that the we present an exact solution to the einstein - hilbert - maxwell equations describing the evolution of the scalar field perturbations during the bounce of the big bang .<n> the bounce is driven by the curvature of the spacetime at the time of the bounce and is preceded by a phase of slow roll inflation . <n> pacs numbers : 04.50.+h , 98.80.cq , 11.27.+d the standard model of particle physics , as we understand it , is characterized by the vacuum energy density @xmath0 , the cosmological constant , and by the lagrangian , which is the time derivative of the metric . in the framework of general relativity , this implies the existence of a curvature , _<n> i.e. _ , a spacetime curvature which is proportional to the gravitational constant . as a consequence ,<n> if one takes into account the curvature in the standard cosmological model , one obtains the standard hot big bang ( bhb ) , in which the energy density of the matter in the universe is much larger than that of the curvature . however , if one also violates the null energy condition , or if one allows for a non we study the time evolution of the free fermion propagator in a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of a scale factor .<n> we show that , for a generic scale factor @xmath0 , the bec undergoes a phase transition from a de sitter - like phase to a  bounce '' phase in which the position of the particle in the bulk of the condensate changes . in the de sitter phase , this phase transition is of second order , while in the bounce phase it is of first order . <n> pacs numbers : : 05.30.-d , 05.45.mt , 03.65.sq in recent years , much effort has been devoted to the study of time evolution in condensed matter systems @xcite . for a system of bosons in one dimension ,<n> this includes , in particular , spin - boson models , fermionic condensates , and models of interacting fermions , see e.g. refs . and references therein . on the theoretical side , one of the most important problems is to understand the behavior of these systems in the long - in this letter , we present a new method to compute the conformal time dependence of the fluctuations of a scalar field .<n> this method is based on the solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations with a potential that has a bounce at some value of the coupling constant , which is determined by the shape of the potential . the height and the position of the central peak and of the wings of the fluctuation spectrum<n> are computed as a function of the bounce radius , and are compared with the results obtained by other methods . <n> pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 11.10.wx , 98.80.cq , 12.20.ds in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the problem of the interaction of a gravitational field with matter . in particular , it has been realized that gravitational waves produced in the center of a rotating black hole can be considered as a kind of  matter - antimatter '' effect , since they can propagate in the gravitational field of the black hole and can interact with the matter perturbations produced at the hole s center @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> astrophysical observations of gravitational waves can be used to determine we show that scalar field perturbations can be exponentially amplified in a bounce .<n> the amplification is due to the violation of the null energy condition at the bounce which leads to a non - symmetric potential for the scalar field . in the case of a symmetric bounce ,<n> the potential has a finite height and its height increases unboundedly as the bounce proceeds . as a consequence , the spectrum of perturbations is modified and large scales can be modified . <n> scalar field fluctuations are exponentially amplified when there is an interaction between the field and the environment , _<n> i.e. _ when the interaction is of the form @xmath0 , where the interaction range @xcite is the planck length . for a free scalar field<n> , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the energy density and the amplitude of the field fluctuations , see e.g. [ eq .

lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology @xcite , with the aim of providing as much information as possible in order to compare with observations . at the core of this confusion<n> is the fact that , despite the simplicity of the formalism , it is not clear how to propagate perturbations perturbatively in general relativity , let alone how to do so in a non - inertial frame of reference , such as that of a flrw universe . as a result ,<n> a number of approximations have been made in the literature , some of which have been found to it is shown that quantum mechanics can be used to provide a bounce in the potential of a quantum system .<n> this is done for the case of the scale factor , where it is found that the potential is everywhere well - behaved , but that there is an ambiguity in the variables used to perturbation the system , indicating that the correct quantum variable to work with is not the wavelength but rather the curvature of the spectrum . <n> it is well - known that the motion of a particle under the influence of a force @xmath0 , such as a gravitational force , can be described by a quantum mechanical action @xcite . in this context<n> , the concept of a bounce was introduced by einstein , who was also able to show that the wave function of the system can be expressed in terms of the position and momentum of the particle , as well as the position of the center of mass of the wave ( see _ e.g. _ , _ phys . rev . lett . * 85 * , 2845 ( 2000 ) ] . since then , various forms of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) equation have been particle creation and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer (  bcs ) interactions are considered in the context of quantum statistical mechanics .<n> it is shown that , in the case of @xmath0 fermions , the time evolution of the particle distribution is given by the solution of the schrdinger equation for a particle in a one - dimensional periodic potential . in this case , bardeen s interaction with the _ cooper _ <n> spin is shown to be irrelevant for the particle creation process , while it plays an important role for the bcs interaction . <n> the problem of particle creation in quantum mechanics has been of considerable interest since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . among the various mechanisms proposed to create particles ,<n> one of the most appealing is the so - called _ bose - einstein condensate _ ( bec ) , where the particles are assumed to be bosons and the interactions between them are given by a _<n> cooper_-schrieffer type potential , _ i.e. _ a bardeen potential that is the sum of two terms : a fermi - dirac term and a gaussian term  we present a new solution to the einstein - hilbert - wheeler - dewitt equation describing the evolution of the universe during a bounce in which the bardeen potential is dominated by the gravitational wave generated during the bounce .<n> the transition from the radiation - dominated to the scalar - dominated era is found to be compatible with other known cosmological transitions . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , based on the weinberg - salam ( ws ) lagrangian , predicts the existence of two scale - invariant degrees of freedom , the higgs and the electroweak gauge bosons , at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite . in order to reconcile this prediction with observations ,<n> it is natural to suppose that the universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion , which was followed by a contraction , or bounce , when the expansion became dominated by gravity . since the bounce is expected to be short - lived , as a consequence , it can be regarded as the beginning of a new era in the history of physics . during this period of time , _<n> i.e. _ the era of the cosmological bounce  we show that the standard @xmath0cdm model can be made compatible with all known observational constraints on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy by allowing for a transition from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated era deep in the radiation era .<n> the transition is driven by the violation of the n - body condition ( nec ) , and can be described by a bouncing universe : the tensor and scalar modes are not affected by the transition , while the tensor modes are affected both before and after the transition and , in particular , the amplitude of the bardeen potential is not modified at all . in order to make the transition as natural as possible , we need to assume that the three - space curvature is negligible at the time the transition occurs . <n> _ introduction._@xmath1 recently , there has been renewed interest in the possibility that the universe may undergo cosmological bounces due to the fact that the cmb temperature is beginning to deviate from its present value @xcite . at the same time<n> , it is becoming increasingly clear that , at least in the context of inflation , our universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion , which the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution to the einstein equations describes a bouncing universe after a period of decelerating expansion .<n> this solution , however , does not apply in situations where more than one scalar field is present , because of the presence of a potential barrier , which prevents the spectrum from hitting the bardeen potential and from exiting the horizon . in this paper<n> , we study the evolution of the spectrum of perturbations with a bardeen - like potential during the transition from radiation to matter in the early universe , and we find that the spectrum is , in general , insensitive to the details of the potential , but can be very different for different fields and different conformal times . <n> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , based on a single scalar field @xcite , describes a wide variety of situations in cosmology , including early and late - time acceleration , density perturbations , gravitational and electromagnetic waves , the cosmological constant problem and the nature of dark energy . for a review of the current status of the problem , see refs.@xcite and refs . @xmath0 . we study the evolution of the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations as they propagate across a bouncing universe . we show that the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations and that the potential @xmath0 is the quantity that matters , in contrast with what happens during inflation .<n> we also show that for more than one field , the situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential . we propose a model in which the universe undergoes a short ( @xmath0 ) phase transition , referred to as bounce , during which the kinetic energy of the inflaton field vanishes .<n> this transition is described by a delta - function transfer matrix which , in the pure de sitter case , is identical to the one obtained in the usual inflationary paradigm . in this model<n> the potential for the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations is completely determined as a function of the hubble scale at the time of the bounce and it is radically different from the one in the inflationary paradigm for which this potential is almost identical . for the perturbation variables , we find that this bounce transition to both a previous contracting phase on one side and to the usual radiation dominated phase later on the other side , can affect large scales of perturbations . <n> the evolution of the universe during and after the bounce is one of the central problems of modern cosmology @xcite . during this period of time ,<n> the expansion phase of the standard model ( sm ) is followed by a phase transition ( called bounce ) during which a fraction of the energy is transferred to a scalar field , called kinetic energy , which is zero at the bounce in a series of recent papers , we have pointed out that there is a regime in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well - behaved , _<n> i.e. _ in the einstein frame , and that this can be used to construct a complete model of the universe , in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the kinetic energy of the scalar field .<n> this mechanism does not violate causality ; it does _ not _ violate causality in the sense that causality is not violated , nor does it violate the nec preservation of the spectrum of gravitational wave . in this paper<n> we provide a more detailed analysis of this mechanism , emphasizing its relevance in view of string motivated models of the pre big bang bounce , as well as in the context of the gravitational wave spectrum . <n> [ [ section ] ] the purpose of this paper is to point out a new mechanism for generating an inflationary bounce in a semi - classical theory of gravity , based on the bardeen s mechanism @xcite , which has the following features : ( i ) the bounce is not a consequence of causality violation ; ( ii ) it does not depend on we construct a model of the universe in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well suited .<n> it is shown that the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation , namely the need for a high curvature phase , which we have seen may drastically modify the physical predictions . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) there has been a lot of recent interest in the physics of bouncing universe models @xcite . in particular , it has become clear that bouncing cosmologies may provide a viable alternative to inflation for the generation of the observed density perturbations ; for instance , in the context of string - motivated scenarios , bouncing universes may provide an explanation for the low scalar spectral index in the cmb anisotropy spectrum , and may also provide a mechanism to solve the apparent tension between the amplitude and phase of the primordial tensor to scalar ratio in the @xmath0-cold dark matter scenario . as pointed out by f. finelli in a recent paper , there is a regime in which the theory of gravity is completely different from that of general relativity , where neither variable is bounded at the bounce ; this shows that there is no in this paper , we show that thematre - bruxelles solution to einstein s field equations in a flat frw background with a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 can be rewritten in the form of a generalized second law of thermodynamics .<n> the new law takes into account the energy - momentum tensor of the universe , as well as the curvature of spacetime . as a consequence ,<n> the equation of state at the big - bang is modified , and the energy density at the present time is smaller than it is in the standard model . <n> pacs number(s ) : 04.50.+h , 98.80.-k , 95.35.+d it has been known since the early days of general relativity ( gr ) that , contrary to what is generally believed , the universe is not in equilibrium . at the same time , it is well - known that the dynamics of the gravitational field is non - stationary , due to the presence of gravity itself @xcite . in order to understand how gravity could have formed in the early universe ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) we propose a new mechanism for the formation of the large scale structure of the universe , in which the energy density associated with the vacuum energy during the dark ages is enhanced by the vacuum fluctuation of the hubble constant during inflation .<n> the mechanism is based on the assumption that the vacuum term in the scalar field equation of state ( eos ) , which is responsible for the generation of the vacuum fluctuations , is coupled to the kinetic energy of the gas component of the primordial density perturbations . in this paper<n> , we show that this mechanism can naturally account for the observationally determined values of the matter - energy density ratio , @xmath0 , as well as for the amplitude of the power spectrum of gravitational waves . <n> # 1#23.6pt # 1 # 1#1 # 1 ( ) # 1([#1 ] ) the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wmap satellite @xcite have significantly improved our understanding of the early universe . at the same time , it has become clear that the anisotropic nature of the present - day universe is a matter of intense debate : is the universe in a decelerating or accelerating we show that , contrary to common belief , the @xmath0-functions of string theory can not be written as products of real numbers .<n> in particular , there is no _ a priori _ requirement that real numbers be real ; instead , we prove that any real number can be expressed as a product of two real numbers and a real function . <n> string theory has enjoyed a long and successful history , in part due to the availability of a large number of different mathematical tools , such as the table of integrals and products @xcite . in recent years , however , it has become clear that string theory is not a simple set - up , but a theory of many interacting particles and fields , which is a natural generalization of general relativity ( gr ) , as well as of quantum field theory ( qft ) and its generalizations . at present ,<n> one of the most important problems in cosmology is to understand the structure of the universe , and in particular the origin of structure in the early universe . to this end , a number of mathematical tools have been developed , some of which are well - known , others are less well - in this paper , we present an algorithm for the construction of a table of rational functions .<n> the algorithm is based on the gauss hypergeometric function method . <n> rational functions are the basis of many applications in physics , chemistry and biology . in particular<n> , the rational functions of interest in these areas can be constructed from the following three families : rational numbers , rational sine and cosine functions , and rational gaussian and lorentzian functions @xmath0 , where the _ a _ stands for the product and _ b _ for the difference between two given numbers . for the purposes of illustration ,<n> we focus on the classical example of the euclidean torus , but the method can be generalized to the study of other periodic structures , such as the periodic table of the chemical reaction @xcite , or the periodic tables of a number of isotopes of helium , for which rational numbers are known to be the ground state . as an example of application of the method , here we will present a family of rational numbers which are the ground states of the hydrogen atom , proton , neutron , ion and helium-3 .",

bacterial bacterial infections , such as bacterial pneumonia ( bp - pneumonia ) , bacterial  infections in staphylococcus aureus ( s - a - s ) or escherichia coli ( ec - ec ) infections . <n> * purpose :<n> * in this study , we investigate the effect of different bacterial signaling pathways on pfr in both normoxic and hyperoxic lungs . + * methods : _ first , _ in order to understand the mechanism of prf , a new set of measurement protocols are developed for the detection and quantification of the presence of different signaling pathways in bacterial lungs , which are known to be important for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia , as well as for the estimation of the lung s * background : * pulmonary fibrosis ( pfr ) is an epidemic that affects approximately one billion people in the developing world .<n> it is characterized by a progressive loss of sensation , weight , and energy , as well as shortness of breath , accompanied by chest pain , swelling , fever and irregular pulsations . in children under one year<n> , pfr can lead to loss of functionality of the entire body , including the eyelids , nose and mouth . <n> * purpose :<n> * in order to understand the underlying mechanisms of pfr and to develop effective therapies to treat pfr in children with pulmonary fibrosis , we investigate the effect of different parametrizations of a drug for treating pfr on the lung s response to that drug . * methods : _ in addition to improving the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the body s ability to respond to parametrize the drug , the proposed therapies may also be used to improve the quality of life of children with pfr by reducing or eliminating side effects , improving the stability of the drug with respect to environmental factors , or reducing the impact of environmental factors on the disease state . +<n> _ we investigate the effect of non -

increased nadh . <n> [ [ section ] ] pulmonary fibrosis ( pf ) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the u.s . due to lack of effective treatment options for patients with pulmonary fibrosis @xcite , there is a growing interest in the development of therapies that can improve the quality of life and prolong the life of the patient . among these<n> , pf is often considered to be the most promising as it has the potential to significantly reduce the morbidity and death rates in patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis , as well as to the effect of kcn on fad and nadh signals in hyperoxic lungs was compared with that in normoxic lungs .<n> kcn was added to lung perfusion with pcp ( nadh , fad , and fad@xmath0 ) in a way that was similar in both the qualitative and quantitative sense . in addition , the addition of pcp was found to have no qualitative or quantitative effect on fad or nadhsignals . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] [ [ section ] ] in recent years , much effort has been devoted to improving the quality of life of patients with pulmonary fibrosis ( psf ) using : ( 1 ) improved assessment of pulmonary fibrosis using _ in -

life time ,<n> most vertebrates are believed to be born with one or two complex hydrocarbons in their bodies . for some time<n> , it has been believed that only a few complex hydrocarbons are present in the human body , however , recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that there are in fact more than one complex hydrocarbons present this paper demonstrates the utility of optical fluorescent imaging for evaluating the effect of subacute rat exposure to hyperoxia on the redox state of lung tissue in a non - destructive manner in isolated perfused lungs . the results suggest a hyperoxie - induced decrease in complex i and ii activities , and demonstrate the ability of this approach to detect a change in mitochondrial redox state in the early phase of hyperoxic lung injury , when histology is not different from that of normoxic rats . <n> lung injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans .<n> one of the most significant factors contributing to the morbidity and death rates in this population is the co - existence of two or more complex pathogens , such as hiv , nemo and escherichia coli ( eccellhei ) , which are present in about one percent of the population in the developing world . due to the high intracellular osmotic pressure ,<n> the elasto - c@xmath0h ( e.g. , @xmath1h ) gradient in the mitochondria plays an important role in the transport of oxygen and other chemical elements in the lung tissue . in this study<n> , we studied the effect of hyperoxia , kcn , and rotenone on the complex i redox state in intact and non - intact hyperoxic lungs .<n> we measured the change in mitochondrial malate - aspartate ( nadh ) signal in the presence and in the absence of these agents for 48 hours following 48 hours of hyper oxoxia or kcn treatment in lungs with different degrees of complex i activity . in addition , changes in nadh signal were measured following the addition of kcn to pcp - treated normoxic lungs for 24 hours . <n> mitochondria plays an important role in the mitotic response to kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) damage and infection , as well as in the regulation of blood flow in the central nervous system ( cns ) , including in diabetes @xcite . as a result<n> , it is known that mitochondria plays a key role in many cellular processes , such as the formation of the lysozyme @xmath0 , which is an important mediator of kh formation in dna . however , the mechanisms by which mitochondria control their own fate are not well understood , especially in the context of lung oxidative stress has been shown to be associated with a variety of cellular processes including , but not limited to , the generation and destruction of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , carbon dioxide , nitrogen vacancy , and other chemical species in the atmosphere .<n> recently , it has been demonstrated that exposure to high levels of oxidative stress in the air causes a decrease in lung aconitase activity , gardner et al . <n> [ arxiv : cond - mat/0409144 ] reported . in this study ,<n> the hyperoxia - induced change in complex i activity and complex i redox state was measured on the surface of the lung of rats exposed to a high level of rate exposure . we report on rat exposure to 100%  documentclass[12pt ] minimal  usepackageamsmath$use packageamssymb ,  usepackagepmsbsy  ( )  + gardner et al . <n> ( 2012 ) [ 24 ] reported a 73% decrease in lung aconitase activity after 24 hrs of rate exposure , and reported a change in the complex i redox state in rat lung enzyme .<n> however it is not known whether this impairment to aconitae activity persists after 48 hrs of exposure . in this study<n> , we report that lung enzyme activity and complex i -

induced injury , and the decrease in rate of complex i using rotenone decreased ros generation in the cells ( @xmath0 ) , . <n> in addition , oxidation of cardiolipin could lead to increase in the loss of electrons at complexes i and i , which is sensitive to ros , in addition to damage to mdna and as a result compromise complexi activity . oxidative phosphorylation of the complex i complex in lung homogenates is known to contribute to alveolar development arrest .<n> however , recent studies have shown that hyperoxia - induced increase in the rate of ros formation could also cause direct damage to complex i activity , which is sensitive to ros . here<n> , we investigate the effects of hyperoxie - induced oxidative phosphorylation on mdna , a transcription factor that codes for the protein complex i in mitochondria , and on mitochondria superoxide formation , another subunit of complex i , using _ ab initio _ calculations and _ in vivo _ experiments . <n> we find that ros phosphorylation is significantly reduced by hyperoxiopolyacetylene ( phi ) and that phi has little effect on the rate at which ros is formed . in addition , phi does not significantly increase the phosphorylation rate of the mitochondrial superoxides formed at complex i.<n> we conclude that the combination of these effects is sufficient to explain the experimental observations , including the role of phi in the development of lung diseases such as lung cancer . since the discovery of lung cancer @xcite , much effort has been devoted to understanding the fad channel has been proposed as a possible mediator of alveolar development arrest .<n> however , recent experimental studies have shown that fad is sensitive to lung tissue concentrations of atp . in this study ,<n> fad and atp were studied as a potential mediator of lung disease using inducible atp from air saccharomyces in healthy rats as a control experiment . <n> fad was measured in response to lung treatment with either normoxic or hyperoxic metabolic inhibitors , and was found to be sensitive to atp content , atp concentration , lung tissue concentration of fad , as well as metabolic inhibitor concentrations . as a result , the fad signal amplification was measured relative to the baseline signal for the fad and nadh channels , indicating that lung treatment was not a primary factor in fad amplification . +<n> pacs numbers : 87.10.+e , 87.23.kg + + _ keywords : _ adenosine triphosphate ( atp)@xmath0alveolars , oxidative phosphorylation , metabolic inhibitor , fad + the goal of this study is to investigate the effect of fad on lung function using a rat model that mimics lung disease in order to the fad signal , which tracks the complex mitochondrial complex ii activity , is measured in rats exposed to either hyperoxia or kcn in lungs from rats with either normoxic or hyperoxic lung treatment .<n> it is found that in the presence of kcn , the change in fad signal following the addition of hyperoxoxia was 56% lower in hyperoxiic lungs than normoxc lungs . it could be that lung treatment with pcp , that simulates the flow of reducing equivalents through the chain , fully oxidized the chain and as a result exposed the difference in the capacities of complex ii betweennormoxic and hyperoxics . <n> living cells track complex mitochondrial activity in order to perform biological functions . in humans ,<n> the complex mitochondria are located in the mitochondria of the adenosine triphosphate ( ad)- and carbon dioxide ( c@xmath0o ) complex , also known as complex iv , and in the case of carbon dioxide , in the guanine complex ( gc ) , complex ii , , etc @xcite . for example , lung mitochondria track complex i activity in rats , while in mitochondria the complex iv activity in carbon dioxide is we present a novel , single - shot , non - invasive assay for measuring the complex ii redox state in the presence of hyperoxia and oxidant concentrations .<n> the method is based on the measurement of the change in the fad signal induced by hyperoxias , as a function of the oxidant concentration , in the absence and presence of a lysozyme . in this assay ,<n> the electron acceptor ( dcpip ) was exposed to the same concentrations of succinate and oxaloacetate ( oaa ) as the mitochondrial isolates from both normoxic and hyperoxic lungs and as a result exposed the difference in the capacities of complex ii between normoxc and hypermoxic lungs . <n> the ability to detect the presence or absence of oxidant - induced changes in the redox state of cells is of fundamental importance in cell biology , chemistry , physics and biology . for example , the detection and quantification of the changes in redox state due to the cation occlusion of cations ( cation - anions ) in the solution of borates @xcite is of great importance for the study of lung diseases , which are characterized by a high level of oxidative stress  in this paper , we report a decrease in the rate of ros formation in hyperoxic rats treated in the superficial layers of normoxic lung .<n> we measured the change in fad and nadh fluorescence in the presence and in the absence of hyperoxia using a new assay . in rats with lung treatment with kcn , lung lactate and pyruvate increased by 4-fold and 22% , respectively , compared to rats without lung treatment , suggesting that lung activity is increased in the hyper oxic regime . however , the depression observed in fad signal in this study is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with a 4-fold decrease in complex ii activity . since electrons channeled through<n> complex ii produce 4-fold more mitochondrial superoxide than electrons channelled through complex i , this apparent depression in complex i and complex ii activities could be a means by the cells to reduce ros production under hyperoxiic conditions . <n> ros is one of the major cellular processes involved in the formation of connective tissue , and is responsible for @xmath0 of all the connective tissue mass in vivo . at physiological conditions , ros can form spontaneously in cells of all levels , including those with only one or two levels @xcite fisher ab demonstrated that rat exposure to 100%  documentclass[12pt]minimal ,  usepackageamsmathfonts /use packageamssymb$,$ ] stimulated glycolysis resulted in a 4-fold increase in lung lactate / pyruvate . in this paper , lung perfusion with kcn increased lung surface nadh signal by 22% in normoxic lungs . unlike nadh which has cytosolic and mitochondrial components sources of redox - sensitive flavoprotein ( fad ) including succinate dehydrogenase ( complex ii ) , lipoamide dehydrogenase ( lipdh ) and electron transfer flavo protein ( etf )<n> , this paper demonstrates that most of the measured lung surface fad signal is from complex ii. however , as previously discussed , the lung surface signal is dominated by complex ii and not by nadh . <n> [ [ section ] ] lung activity is regulated by a complex network of chemical reactions and chemical signaling pathways that occur in the lung tissue .<n> the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that kcn , an enzyme involved in lung glycolysis , increases the signal of lung surface enzymatic reactions . in this study , we investigate the effect of hyperoxia on lung histology , hemodynamic and functional endpoints measured with rat exposure to xenon . the present study document that lung tissue cytoplasm is more reduced in hyperoxic lungs than normoxic lungs .<n> thus , coupled with the data , the data document that both tissue cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments are more reduced , and in some cases , more unequal , in the hyperoxics than in the normoxics . the hyperoxia -

mills theory , and the gauge coupling is proportional to the mass of the gauge field . here<n> we give an overview of the results , including a new proof that the solutions are in fact supersymmetric . in the process<n> we also give a short review of the recent work of the authors on duality walls , duality trees and fractional d - branes , as well as of work by benvenuti , franco , sparks and kazakopoulos . we discuss the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) solution to the supergravity duals of @xmath0 super yang - mills ( ssg ) gauge theories .<n> the solution describes the baryonic branch of a supersymmetric ( susy ) family of conifold manifolds . <n> [ [ section ] ] the ks solution @xcite is a solution of the susy gravity duals ( gsd ) of the supersymmetric yang - lee and su(n)-gsu(n+m ) theories , which are dual to each other in the standard model ( sm ) at the one - loop level . in the simplest version of the solution ,<n> the gauge group is su(@xmath1 ) , and the gauge coupling is su(2 ) or su(3 ) in the bulk , while in the second version , the gauge and matter groups are susy and susy respectively in the boundary and in the scalar sector . here<n> , we describe the solution in detail , showing that it is a sasaki - einstein ( einstein - like ) manifold and that the gauge we construct a warped conifold in @xmath0 super yang - mills theory .<n> the construction is based on a recent result of kutasov , parnachev and sahakyan @xcite . <n> _ introduction _ in supersymmetric gauge theories , one of the most important issues is to understand the mechanism of electric - magnetic duality ( emd ) , i.e. , the non - perturbative mechanism by which electric and magnetic symmetries are converted into each other in a dual way . the emd mechanism has been extensively studied in gauge theories of the standard model ( sm ) as well as in theories beyond the sm ( see , for example , refs . * 45bc * , 1 ( 1996 ) and the references therein )<n> . however , in the case of non - sm gauge theories such as susy ( see for example the references above ) it is much less well understood . in particular , it is well - known that in susy the gauge group is not the same as the higgs field , and the gauge transformations are not dual to each other . on the other hand ,<n> the in this talk , we summarize our recent results on moduli stabilization in matrix models and their applications to the chiral ring phase in supersymmetric gauge theories . <n> the purpose of this talk is to give a brief overview of some of the recent developments in the field of matrix models @xcite .<n> we hope that this contribution will be useful for non - specialists , especially the readers with an interest in the non - perturbative dynamics of gauge theories and especially the role of moduli in them , as well as to those working on related problems . in the last few years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in using holomorphic techniques to solve matrix models in order to understand the structure of the moduli spaces of the theories that describe gauge interactions at the unification scale . among these<n> are the supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories which are central to our understanding of the physics at the planck scale , and in particular to the @xmath0 super yang - mills ( ssm ) theory , which describes gauge interactions in the standard model ( sm ) and in the minimal supersymmetric extension of it ( mssem ) . for a review of the current status of the we discuss the duality between the @xmath0 super yang mills theory and the standard model on a warped , cascading throat . <n> * hep -

frequency ( rf ) sources .<n> we find that the fluctuation field is overdispersed compared to that of unclustered sources , and the concept of confusion noise and confusion limit is formulated in terms of the field overdispersity . <n> pacs numbers : 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.65.hw , 43.25.+a intensity fluctuations in electromagnetic fields have been studied for a long time @xcite . in recent years<n> , it has been realized that the intensity fluctuations can be measured by radio - wave interferometers (  rf - ifets ) , which are arrays of small number of antennas , @xmath0@xmath1 , for each ion beam . for rf - iifets<n> . however , the measurement of intensity fluctuations is limited by the confusion limit , i.e. the limit of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the detection of the fluctuations is much smaller than that of the total fluctuation field . to overcome this limitation ,<n> it is important to take into account the fluctuations of in this paper , we show that the _ confusion limit _ can be formulated as the fluctuation field overdispersed compared to that of unclustered sources . it is a natural result that @xmath0 is the same as that of _ unclustering sources _ , which is called the  confusion limit ' . <n> the concept of confusion noise and confusion limit is closely related to the fluctuation fields .<n> we formulated the confusion limit for a power - law source number counts , and extended the formulation for general number counts by @xcite . in comparison with their own method , they claim to use a monte carlo approach to evaluate in that case . however , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , there is an expression for the fluctuations and we can utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . as a result , their setting assumes that the dispersion of the error does not depend on the source flux , even in such a simple case , but they pointed out that when the confusion noises dominate the error , the total noise can not be gaussian and gave a qualitative discussion on the problem . we clarified the difference between we discuss the problem of _ confusion _ and _ blending _ raised by @xcite .<n> the term  confusion limit ' is related to the former phenomenon , and consequently , confusion limit flux is weaker than the noise flux for bright sources . however , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , we have an expression for the fluctuation field , which allows us to utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . <n> [ firstpage ] cosmology : diffuse radiation , dark matter the detection of diffuse radiation is one of the most important tasks in observational cosmology . in recent years<n> , various experiments have been carried out , such as cmb anisotropies , galaxy redshift survey , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) and ground - based vlbi observations . among them , the _ planck _<n> experiment is the most promising due to its high sensitivity to the high - mass x - ray sources in the local universe . on the other hand ,<n> there are many other experiments , in a recent study by @xcite , it was found that the number counts of @xmath0-ray point sources in the beam of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) are significantly different from those of unclustered and clustered sources . in this letter , we show that this difference is not due to the difference in the number of counts between the two types of sources , but rather due to their different clustering properties .<n> we also show that the difference can be explained by the fact that there are two or more clustered sources with fluxes fainter than the beam power . <n> the number count of a point - like source in a beam is an important quantity , which can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of the emission region of the emitting particles . as a result<n> , the precise number counts can be obtained not only from the position of the detected point source but also from that of its flux , provided that the beam structure is known . for example , by combining the position information of all the detected sources in a ccd image , one can distinguish the point sources from the background . on the other we propose a new method to obtain the number counts of unclustered point and clustered sources , based on the difference between the confusion noise flux and the confusion limit flux .<n> we express the limit signal strength as an upper cutoff of the integration in the second - order cumulant formulae , and derive the general relation between the beam size and the source confusion limit . <n> confusion noise is a kind of background in the image data in a real situation , which is introduced in order to extract the true number counts from the confused number counts @xcite . in a recent study ,<n> it has been shown that confusion noise provides a significant advantage in the estimation of the number count of a point or a clustered source , when the number of the clustered sources is smaller than @xmath0 , or the beamsize is larger than the beam - size - dependent confusion noise threshold . here<n> we present a general method to calculate the confusion - noise - threshold relation in the case of a ccd - based ccd imaging system , where we have a large number of ccds in the beam , such as the ccd ccd camera , for example . as a result<n> , we can estimate the number recent work has shown that the maximum number of counts that can be confused with a single source in a given data set is limited by the exponential of the number of times the source can be resolved to within the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .<n> we show that this limit depends on the character @xmath0 of the underlying number count . for sources described by a power - law ,<n> the confusion limit is given by the exponent of the cumulative count slope . in the case of clustered sources<n> , the limit is a cutoff signal . <n> the exponential number count ( xc ) law @xcite is one of the most widely used number - count counting laws ( lcs ) , along with the kolmogorov - smirnov law ( ksl ) and the log - log law ( tll ) of number - counts per spectral bin , which have been used to estimate the number density of luminous x - ray sources ( lsbs ) from _ quasar _ and _ pulsar _ data , and to derive constraints on the nature of the x - rays in these sources . however , it has been shown that we study the confusion limit of a single source and a clustered source of gaussian beams .<n> we derive an analytic formula for the limit and discuss its relation to the so - called empirical rule of thumb for the source size . <n> the limit @xmath0 is defined as the ratio of the number of photons in the beam to the source s size @xcite . in this limit<n> , the number ( @x ) of photons per beam is called confusion limit , and it is defined by the product of the effective beam size and the fwhm of the beam . for single sources ,<n> we show that the limit is given by the formula [ eq : nc_power ] , which is a generalization of the classical confusion limit given by eqs : conf_lim_sigma and _equiv_-omega_rm eff  s_d s = alpha h(theta ) nonumber & equiv & s - gamma  ( ) + int_0s_,endaligned ; ] for clustered sources  in this paper , we propose a method to determine the confusion limit of single and clustered radio sources .<n> the method is based on the concept of the _ confusion threshold _ , which is defined as @xmath0 in the standard confusion limit , and is valid for arbitrary number of sources , arbitrary frequency of the radio emission , as well as arbitrary orientation of the source relative to the observer s line of sight . as an example<n> , the limit is calculated for the free - free and the clustered ion beam . <n> pacs numbers : 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.65.sf in recent years , radio astronomy has become a very active field of research , both from a fundamental and a practical point of view . in the field of radio astronomy ,<n> the fundamental limit of the confusion @xcite , i.e. the limit at which no information can be extracted from the acquired data , has been one of the main topics of the past few years . from a practical viewpoint , there is a great deal of interest in the development of radio interferometers , for example , in order to detect gravitational in this paper , we study the number counts of the gaussian beam in the confusion limit .<n> we present an iterative formula for the general number counts . as a result ,<n> we obtain the number of number counts @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the previous results . <n> recently , a new field of laser - based quantum information processing ( qip ) has emerged , so - called quantum communication ( qc ) @xcite . in qc<n> , quantum channels are combined into a quantum channel , and then the quantum channel is converted to a classical channel . to achieve a quantum network , it is essential to have a reliable method to transfer the quantum state from one quantum channel to another , such as number of quantum channels , number of rounds of computation , etc.@xcite in the case of quantum teleportation , the teleportation protocol is based on the entanglement of two quantum states , e.g. entanglement of teleported states of two parties , one of which is alice and the other one bob , in alice s computer . for teleportation of quantum states from one party to the other , there is we study the beam - size dependence of the number - count statistics for @xmath0 collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .<n> we find that the beam size effect can be more important than the source - clustering effect , which is usually considered in the literature . <n> relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hics ) have been studied for a long time , since they are one of the most powerful tools to probe the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the strong - field regime @xcite . in rhic<n> , the pb - pb collisions are of particular interest because of their high rate and the possibility of such a large number of unbound particles in the final state . for the last decade ,<n> the rhic experiments have been the focus of intense theoretical and experimental efforts . due to the high luminosity and the large initial energy of the beams , rhic has become the leading source of inelastic neutron - proton scattering at rhic ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for recent reviews ) as well as for the inelastic x - ray scattering ( ines ) at x - we study the angular correlation function of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) .<n> we find that the galaxy correlation function on the sky can be well approximated by a power - law , @xmath0 , with a slope of @xcite , which is shallower than the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks)-@xmath1 correlation , but steeper than the two - point correlation function . <n> galaxy clustering is one of the most important observational properties of the galaxy population . in order to understand the clustering of galaxies , we need to know the correlation functions of the galaxies . to this end ,<n> we have performed a series of numerical experiments for angular galaxy correlation functions , both analytically and numerically , by using a set of publicly - available data sets , _<n> e.g. _ , dr7 ( see , for example , * ? ?<n> * ) and the first data release ( dr1 ) of the subaru / suprime - cam ( suic ) survey . here<n> we focus on the galaxy clustering , the source confusion limits for galaxies in the forthcoming infrared and submillimeter galaxy surveys are calculated .<n> we show that the confusion limits of @xmath0 m surveys will be strongly dependent on the depth of the surveys , and will be at the level of a few percents of the characteristic depth . <n> the infrared galaxy distribution is a powerful tool to study the galaxy formation and evolution in the universe @xcite . in the infrared band ,<n> galaxies are mainly disk galaxies , but in the submillimeter range , star - forming galaxies are also present . at the millimeter and centimeter wavelengths , the galaxy distribution can be approximated by a gaussian , which is a result of local inhomogeneity of the initial mass function ( imf ) . on the other hand , in the near - infrared , where galaxies are predominantly disks , there is a strong dependence of the imf on the wavelength , i.e. , galaxies are more likely to be detected at shorter wavelengths . the angular correlation function of infrared galaxies is known to be strongly affected by the clustering of galaxies on the sky and by the confusion of infrared surveys . today , most of the studies on the distribution of we investigate the clustering properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies in the _ planck _ era .<n> we find that the cmb is significantly more strongly clustered than the diffuse x - ray background ( dpbg ) , and that the degree of clustering increases with the angular size of the detected cmb sources . we show that the correlation function of the angular cross - correlation between the cmbs at different flux levels has a power - law form , @xmath0 , where the exponent is given in terms of the flux correlation function at a given angular scale . at the highest fluxes ,<n> the angular correlation function is described by a log - normal distribution , while at the lowest fluxes the distribution is a power law with an exponent that depends on the angular scale of the survey . <n> cosmology is entering a new era with the launch of the planck satellite , which will provide the highest angular resolution and sensitivity ever achieved for a cosmological signal . in the planeck era<n> , we will measure the anisotropic diffuse radiation from the entire sky at an unprecedented angular resolution @xcite . for the first time , this high angular resolution will allow us to the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope is an ideal instrument to study the large - scale structure of the universe , because it has a good collecting area of @xmath0 m@xmath1 .<n> we show that the confusion - related statistics associated with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy can be strongly affected by the correlation structure . in particular , we find that the statistics of the cmb asymmetries are significantly different from those of the large scale structure ( lss ) , which is a consequence of the strong correlation structure between the two . for example ,<n> the statistics related to the confusion of the galaxy number counts show a clear dependence on the slope of the power - law number count models , i.e. , the index of the integrated counts . on the other hand<n> , these statistics do not depend on the shape of the model , and they do not show any dependence on whether the counts are localized at the source , as long as the source is separated from the survey path . <n> cosmic microwave radiation ( cmr ) is one of the most important probes of the early universe @xcite . to the _ iras _ galaxy survey shows a good fit to the euclidean slope ( slope index @xmath0 in differential counts ) , and we can safely fix the slope of the model @xcite to be 2.5 above the flux ( flux - dependent clustering in gradual way ) of _ qmw galaxy counts .<n> the confusion - related statistics for the cases with and without clustering are estimated . in order to calculate the confusion limit with clustering , we approximate the clustering of the whole sample galaxies evaluated at a  fiducial ' flux , which is fainter than the point source detection limit , in principle , toward infinitesimally faint flux . fluctuation consists not only of the detected sources but also of unresolvable sources fainter - than detection limit (  fluctuation in principle ' :  in principle it ' means  if ' the source is not detected , it will be too faint to be confused , ' etc . ] . we found that the  confusion limit ' of the clustering strength of the sample galaxies is about 0.5 jy at a flux of 50 mjy . [ firstpage ] galaxies : clustering cosmology : we present a clustering analysis of the _ iras _ infrared galaxy sample , and show that the effect of clustering on the confusion - limit flux is large .<n> we find that the rms of the confusion noise is larger than that of unclustered case , especially when the cumulative number count slope @xmath0 of the infrared galaxies is close to 1 . <n> clustering of galaxies is one of the most important issues in the study of the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . in the local universe ,<n> the void probability is very small , so that the probability of finding a very low intensity at a certain position ( closely related to  the void chance ' ) increases when clustering takes place . on the other hand , in the distant universe <n> , the probability for finding a low intensity is very large , thus , a large fraction of the total infrared luminosity is expected to be in the form of infrared fluctuation . as a result ,  confusion noise ' , which is the noise due to the confusion of infrared galaxy distribution , will be amplified significantly , making it difficult to detect all the infrared sources in the universe . recently , there we present the effect of clustering on the confusion noise of infrared number counts of dusty galaxies , based on the simple model of the spatial two - point correlation function of galaxies .<n> our central aim was to estimate the power spectrum of the fluctuation in the submillimeter and radio background , and we considered only the second - order statistics , i.e. , confusion limit . we found that the clustering makes the confusion limit much shallower than that of unclustered case . actually , the broadening of the probability density function ( pdf ) by clustering is very strong , which result in a large variance of fluctuation pdf . in summary , it is shown that clustering can be very severe if the number counts are described by _ a single power - law_. the relative contribution of clustering to the total fluctuation compared with poisson component becomes larger for large @xmath0 . these are consistent with the results reported by @xcite for dusty galaxies at ir wavelengths . <n> [ sec : firstpage ] infrared ( ir ) number counts have been one of the main sources of information about the large - scale structure of the universe , especially in the radio and submillimeter ( submm ) bands deep galaxy surveys by _ iso _ revealed some striking features of the infrared galaxy counts .<n> the observed number counts of infrared galaxies can not be described by a power - law function . here<n> we present some theoretical models of infrared galaxy number counts at 90 and 170 @xmath0 m , which can be used to calculate the confusion limits of such realistic counts , and the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of such infrared galaxy sources . <n> _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_is a global , multi - wavelength infrared astronomical satellite launched in 2003 @xcite , with a collecting area of about 100 m@xmath1 and an effective wavelength range of about 1030 , from the far - infrared to the mid - infrared . since the iso satellite was first launched , iso has continued to provide deeper and deeper galaxy surveys , especially in the near - infrared and optical bands . in the optical band ,<n> the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2degsrs )@ xmm - newton have provided important insights into the galaxy distribution and evolution . the _ sirtf _ and _ astro - f _ missions will provide a great opportunity for the fluctuation analysis of number counts in the far - infrared . here<n> we investigate the effect of clustering and evolution of dusty galaxies on the confusion limits that can be obtained .<n> we find that clustering does not affect the confusion limit significantly . on the other hand ,<n> fluctuation analysis is required to estimate galaxy evolution from the analysis of the data that will be obtained by _<n> sirtf_. <n> _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ _ @xmath0 m ) is one of the most powerful tools for number count analysis because of its wide field of view , high angular resolution , and wide energy range . in the near future , it will provide not only the most accurate number counts , but also the best estimates of galaxy evolution at high redshift @xcite . to achieve this goal , one has to take into account the effects of noise and systematics , which are inevitable in the data analysis . at present , most of the noise studies are based on power - law number counts at the 1-@xmath1 level . however , in the future we investigate the statistical properties of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation from dusty starburst galaxies .<n> we find that the probability of finding a small flux density is increased by the effect of clustering , and that the maximum value of the probability density is shifted to a lower value than that expected from the classical formula . for the estimation of the galaxy confusion effect in future submillimeter large surveys<n> , we present a new formula for the two - point correlation function of submillimeter galaxies , which takes into account the clustering effect . source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington .<n> fundamental assumption of the formulation is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky . however , this assumption is not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe . _ iras _ galaxies , clustering increases the confusion limits from 20 % to 100 % , depending on the adopted assumption for the spectral energy distribution of galaxies . in this work , by making extensive use of the methods related to the point field theory , we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae ,<n> we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure . as a first application , the submillimeter source confusion from power - law galaxy number counts is calculated . we found that the contribution of clustering to the confusion is significant , especially for the counts with an airy psf . for galaxy clustering , a hierarchical _ ansatz _ was adopted , and the higher - order correlation functions were calculated in the we studied the statistical properties of infrared galaxy confusion noise , which is caused by infrared galaxies with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .<n> we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical characteristics of the confusion noise caused by the sources with the prescribed correlation structure<n> . then we calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . at @xmath0 ,<n> the probability density function of the fluctuation intensity broadened by the clustering effect , i.e. , increase of the variance , was found . as for the probability at these wavelength bands , the peak probability also decreases up to @xcite . <n> the infrared galaxy ( ig ) population is one of the most important tracers of the large - scale structure in the universe . among them , infrared galaxies are of particular interest because of the fact that they are the most luminous sources in the near - infrared , and they have the largest number density at all ir wavelengths . in the ig population<n> , there are two kinds of sources : ( 1 ) _ a submillimeter galaxies are dusty vigorous starbursts , and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation . in this paper , we present a new method to estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf _ submillimeter surveys .<n> we find that the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the submillimeter galaxy number counts decrease up to @xmath0 % and the peak probability up to@xmath1 % , respectively , when we consider the effect of clustering , which is caused by the dust extinction of submillimeter bright galaxies . as for the pdf at these wavelength bands ,<n> the peak probabilities also decreases up to a few percent , but the tail of the pdf becomes heavier . <n> this effect may not seem very severe , because present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics . however , it must keep this effect in mind when we estimate galaxy evolutionary from the fluctuations of the data . we will also apply our method to future submillimeter large survey . our analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated complex cosmological models . in this paper , we study the statistical properties of the probability generating function ( pgf ) , @xmath0  equiv , sum_n=0infty(sf p_n n[k ] ) $ ] of a stochastic process with a gaussian initial condition .<n> we show that , in contrast to the pgfs , the distribution of the moments of the _ mean _ value of the random variable is not a random variable , but it is a _ poisson process _ , where the mean and the variance of the variance are independent of the initial conditions . <n> pacs numbers : 02.50.-r , 05.40.-a , 89.70.+c _ introduction _ in statistical mechanics , a random process is characterized by a probability distribution which is a sum of independent moments . in the case of a deterministic process ,<n> the moments are independent random variables , and the distribution can be described by a poisson distribution with a mean and a variance that depend on the initial condition @xcite . however , for a stochastic here we present the derivation of the first- and second - order cumulants for the fluctuation field of clustered sources .<n> these summary statistics are extensively used in the field of structure formation . in this paper , we propose a cumulant - based method to generate the cumulant of any order in quantum statistical mechanics .<n> the method is based on the concept of generating cumulants , i.e. , cumulants of order @xmath0 , from a set of cumulant variables . here<n> , the first - order cumulant is directly observed , while the second - order one is generated by a simple procedure . as an application of the method ,<n> we consider the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpde ) , which describes the dynamics of a quantum many - body system under the influence of external fields . in the case of the gpde of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system , in the weak - coupling regime , it is known that the distribution of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian is universal , independent of the system s parameters . on the other hand , when the system is strongly coupled to the environment , such as to a thermal bath , or to a harmonic potential , then the distribution is not universal and depends on the system parameters such as the strength of the interaction , and we calculate the second - order cumulant of the electron self - energy , @xmath0 , at finite baryon density and temperature .<n> we find that the cumulant exhibits a non - monotonic behavior as a function of temperature , indicating a transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic electron gas . <n> pacs number(s ) : 24.10.cn , 25.30.fj , 05.70.fh , 51.10.+y , 52.35.fp , 12.20.ds the electron gas ( egm ) plays an important role in many fields of physics , including high -

north catalog @xcite . for the first time , we are able to measure the proper motion of each star in a proper motion catalog . using this catalog ,<n> we show that the probability for a common proper motion pair to be a chance alignment is very low , and we present an empirical model of the distribution of chance alignments in phase space . <n> proper motion stars are stars that move relative to the local standard of rest , as a result of their interaction with the surrounding medium . in the standard model of stellar evolution , stars are assumed to be born in the same region of the sky at the same time they are born in different parts of the same sky , with the distance between the centers of gravity of the two sets of stars depending on their proper motions and luminosities . as the star is born in a different region , its proper motion is different from that of the other star  we present an empirical analysis of the stellar proper motion distribution in the large synoptic survey - north ( lspm - north ) .<n> we show that proper motion pairings are more common among stars with larger proper motion than among stars of the same proper motion . also , proper motion pairs are more likely to be found in denser regions of the sky , such as clusters , groups and associations . <n> proper motion ( @xmath0 ) is the sum of the squares of the positions of all stars in the sky divided by the proper motion of the host galaxy @xcite . for a given stellar population ,<n> the distribution of proper motion with respect to the galactic plane is well described by a gaussian distribution , with a mean proper motion that is proportional to the square root of the distance from the center of the galaxy to the observer , and with a dispersion that is independent of the luminosity of the star . in the case of a population of stars , defined as the number of stars within a given proper motion interval , the distribution is skewed towards stars that are closer to us , in the sense that more stars are closer towards us at a given luminosity , i.e. , we present a new method to calculate the angular separations between stars based on the hipparcos distance scale .<n> this method is based on a simulation of the chemistry of the early universe that effectively eliminates the chance of pairing stars . using this method<n> , we calculate the separations for stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lspm ) and the galactic center ( gc ) , and find that they are in excellent agreement with observations . <n> # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' common proper motion ( cpm ) binaries are the most common class of stellar binary systems .<n> they are characterized by the same orbital elements , orbital periods , and proper motions , so they are often assumed to be physically distinct from each other . however , the majority of known cpm binaries are short period ( @xmath0yr ) systems , which are not expected to be wide binaries . here<n> we present a new method to search for wide binaries in the _ hipparcos _ catalog of nearby stars , based on the fact that the distribution of cpm stars is statistically independent of the proper motion of the stars . <n> binaries with orbital periods shorter than the age of the universe , i.e. , less than 1 gyr , are called  wide binaries '' ( wbs ) . in the last decade<n> , wbs have been found in the halo of our galaxy , in the thin disk of the smc , on the white dwarf ( wd ) side of the taurus - auriga ob2 association , as well as in the lmc and in the large magellanic cloud ( lmco ) wide binary systems ( wbs ) are systems in which the orbital period of one star is shorter than the period of the other star , and/or the orbital separation is larger than the angular separation .<n> these so - called classical point - contact ( cpm ) binaries are of particular interest because they are relatively easy to discover and can be used to measure orbital parameters . here<n> we report the discovery of cpm binaries in the berkeley - illinois - maryland association catalog of high proper motion stars ( 0.15 yr@xmath0 ) , based on a new objectively - defined search method . using this catalog ,<n> we show that there are _ at least _ 6 new cpm candidates , including 3 eclipsing binaries , all of which have not previously been reported in the literature . <n> the search method is based on an objectively defined search area in phase space , defined by the ratio of the distances of the two stars in the system and the proper motions of the stars . for stars in this search area<n> , we find that there is a high probability for a data pair to be a cpm double , independent of the proper motion difference between the stars and the distance between the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) , currently under construction in southern arizona , will survey an area of the sky @xmath0 deg@xmath1 , including the northern celestial equator , with sufficient angular resolution to detect the motion of stars on the sky with a high degree of confidence .<n> the proper motions of stars in this region are expected to be very similar , making it possible to search for pairs with large differences in their proper motions , so - called cpm doubles . here<n> we report the first results of such a search , using a series of n - body simulations to identify pairs which are chance alignments , or pairs whose proper motions are such that they should have the same probability of being double stars , as a function of the time over one year from the start of the survey . in the first year of operation ,<n> we have identified 17 double stars with projected separations between 1 and 10au , and proper motions between 0 and 1000kms@xcite . <n> the large area survey ( lat ) is an ambitious , wide - field , high resolution survey of the northern galactic plane ( lp ) @xcite ( see  we report the first results of a systematic search for proper motions of _ hipparcos _ stars in wide ( @xmath0au ) binaries .<n> our method is to search for the expected signature of an eccentric orbit in the proper motion of the primary and/or secondary star , and to limit the search to pairs with minimal contamination from chance alignments . using the large synoptic survey telescope ( lspm ) , we searched for wide binaries in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) north region , as well as in the lmc itself . in the course of these searches ,<n> we have identified a total of 168 candidate wide binaries / multiples , with projected proper motions @xcite . <n> the discovery of wide binaries is one of the most important pieces of information about stars that can be gathered with a space telescope , because they are the most numerous class of objects in the galaxy , including cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and double - degenerate systems ( ddss ; both cvs and wide binaries are single stars , but cvs can also be multiple - star systems ) as long as they are not part of a common envelope . we report the discovery of 168 new wide binary / multiple systems selected from the catalog of common proper motion ( cpm ) stars of the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( _ cfht _ ) wide binary search project .<n> the angular separations of these systems range from @xmath0 , and the probability that they are chance alignments ( open and filled triangles ) is as high as 90% . <n> the cpm catalog ( http://www.cpm.uio.ca ) was created by the authors from the results of a systematic search of the sky with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and ground - based telescopes from the 1970s to the 1990s , with the primary goal of finding new wide binaries / multiples among the stars of our galaxy and the magellanic clouds . among the thousands of new discoveries made during this search ,<n> we are most interested in systems with separations larger than about 0.1 arcsec , which have at least one component with a proper motion larger than 10 yr@xmath1 . in the case of wide binaries<n> , the primary component of each star should have a parallax measured by _ hipparc we present the analysis of the _ ubvrijhk _ catalog of astrometric binaries , which is based on the three year _ kepler _ mission data .<n> the catalog contains the positions , proper motions , and luminosities of all spectroscopic binaries with at least one star in the system , as well as the parallaxes of their individual components . <n> we search the catalog for double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( cpm doubles ) , in which the components of the same star lie at the same angular separation , have the same proper motion vector , or have similar angular positions and proper motion vectors . for each pair of stars , we identify the component that is most likely to be in a cpm double based on their parallaxes , their proper motion and/or their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( which are accurate to better than 10% for stars with @xmath0 mas yr@xmath1 )<n> . then we subtract the components that are not in cpm pairs . in the final cut ,<n> we have a list of rejected pairs that are still consistent with being cpm binaries . among the stars in these pairs<n> are we have searched the _ hipparcos _ catalog for wide pairs of stars ( cpm ) in the direction of the galactic plane ( r.a . , @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) .<n> our search yielded 158 candidate pairs , of which 55 were rejected as true pairs based on their angular separations , colors , proper motions , or parallaxes . of these 55 pairs<n> , we found 2 new pairs that are likely to be physical pairs . \"<n> a complete list of all cpm pairs with more than two components is given , as well as a table of the lspm catalog number of the primary , its catalog number , and the estimated parallax error in milliarcseconds , the angular separation between the components , their proper motion in r. a. and d. the proper motion of each component in a cpm pair is also given . in this paper<n> we report the results of our search for very wide pairs ( with separations greater than 100 au ) of stars in the galactic field . for each star s proper motion , color , optical - to - infrared color and parallax ,<n> we give the l we have searched the _ hipparcos _ catalog for cpm multiples consisting of one or more non - _hipparcos<n> _ stars .<n> we find that of the 158 systems reported here , only 80 of the doubles ( and none of the triples ) had been previously reported in gc04 . a little more than half the systems in our list are thus  new '' cpm systems . using again the method described in 2 , we searched the lspm - north catalog for  c pm multiples '' consisting of an _ _ star with one ( or more ) non -_hippies . in total , 5 triple systems are found . <n> we have used the @xmath0 yr@xmath1 proper motions of the stars in our sample to search for orbital motion in the direction of each star , and we have estimated the proper motion for each star in its own direction , as well as for those of other stars in the sample . we have also used the proper motions and photometry from the literature to estimate the parallaxes for the stars and to compare them to our proper motion and parallaxes estimates . for each of the we present a list of _ hipparcos _ multiple stellar systems with companions in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( h@xmath0 ) .<n> we have searched the hst / wfc3 , 2mass , and lspm - north catalogs for cpm multiples consisting of one or more stars with a non - _hipparcos<n> _ companion . among the @xmath1 systems in our sample , we find 158 cpm pairs , 5 triples ( including one triple with an _ m _ star ) and 1 quadruple system . we have also searched the ls pm - north catalog for pairs with cpm companions and found 347 cpm doubles , 10 triples and 1 quadruply . we report the results of a search for cpm binary stars in the lspm - north using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> we have identified a total of @xmath0 cpm binaries in the northern sky , of which @xcite one is likely to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( slsb ) or a chance alignment , and the remaining 14 are probable pairs . in this paper<n> , we describe the catalog and color - magnitude diagrams for the pairs , as well as tests which can be used to verify the binary status of those stars . secondary stars can be used as probes of various stellar phenomena , including masses and ages , rotation , mass loss , and more . here<n> we investigate the distribution of secondary stars in the vicinity of the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequences .<n> we find that most secondaries lie close to either the standard main sequence or the cooling white dwarf sequence . <n> stars with masses @xmath0m@xmath1 are found to span a wide range of evolutionary stages , from subdwarfs to supergiants . in the late sdss class ,<n> the upper main sequence is dominated by red dwarfs @xcite , while in the lmc , it is primarily dominated by dwarfs of spectral types later than k5 @x<n> . the majority of white dwarfs are substellar , with spectral types ranging from m6 to m8 @x , but a significant number of them are hot , helium - burning dwarfs , which have not yet been explained in terms of stellar models . by the end of the t tauri phase , they have lost most of their hydrogen and helium envelopes , making them unlikely to be pre - main sequence stars we use the _ hipparcos _ catalog of white dwarfs and subdwarfs with known trigonometric parallaxes to study the distribution of secondaries near the main sequence or the white dwarf cooling sequence .<n> secondaries are found to exhibit a wide range of properties , including short separations close to the main and white dwarf sequences , large separations , and large dispersions about the main or white dwarf sequence , depending on the distance to the secondaries . <n> white dwarf secondaries ( @xmath0 ) are the most numerous class of stars in the solar neighborhood , yet their distribution in the hertzsprung - russell diagram is not well understood . in particular<n> , the distribution is not expected to be strongly bimodal , with secondaries preferentially located near the upper or lower main sequences . here<n> we show that this apparent bimodality can be resolved by considering secondaries that are separated by more than the distance between the two components of the binary , as determined from a fit to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite parallaxes of nearby white dwarf stars . using this method , we find that we report the discovery of a new sequence of subdwarf companions to main sequence stars in the galactic disk .<n> the new companions are detected as secondaries in _ hubble space telescope _<n> advanced camera for surveys observations of the nearby open cluster ngc 6946 . using @xmath0 photometry , we find secondaries on average 0.11 mag below the standard main sequence , with a dispersion of 1.33 mag , and lying between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence with a mean offset of 0.05 mag . we find 20 pairs with mismatched companions ; nine of these secondaries are found lying 0.9 mag above the standard primary sequence . some of the secondaries could be foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with foreground _ hipparcos _ stars , or be foreground white dwarfs or red subd warfs , but most of the pairs with wide secondaries may be single stars . <n> stars in our galaxy are often observed to lie within a narrow range of apparent magnitude of the well - known main sequence of evolved stars ; these stars are called  main sequence '' stars ( or  dwarfs '' for use in the stellar context ) @xcite  spectroscopic parallaxes from the _ hipparcos _ satellite have revealed a growing number of secondaries to main sequence stars .<n> these secondaries have the same colors and magnitudes as the main sequence pairs , but they are bluer in the optical , shifting them blueward in the ( m@xmath0,v - j ) color - magnitude diagram . in the near - infrared , red subdwarfs are the metal - poor counterparts of the main - sequence red dwarfs , and they are expected to fall between the red dwarf sequence and the white dwarf sequence . here , we present kinematic tests that can be applied to secondaries in order to decide if they are subd warfs . we find that the kinematics of hip 35756 ( g 89 - 14 ) , a known double in the solar neighborhood , strongly argues in favor of it being a subd warsugef , with log(fe / h ) = @xmath1 . <n> we also find that hip 4594 ( g 362 - 1 ) a known spectroscopic double , is a likely member of the thick disk or halo of the milky way ; with a kinematics v@ we report the results of a search for wide cpm binaries among known spectroscopic subdwarfs .<n> we find no new pairs with separations larger than @xmath0 , with the exception of hip 35756 ( g 89 -

studied star forming region in the galactic disk . over the last 30 years ,<n> the number of known binaries in this region has increased dramatically , from a handful to more than 100 . in this letter<n> , we present a catalog of all known cpm binaries in taurus with proper motions and radial velocity information , as well as a new analysis of the cpm binary radial velocity data in the lspm - north field . using the proper motions of the stars in the pairs and the radial velocities of the dwarf component , a search for possible subdwarfs<n> is carried out , finding one new possible candidate in the system , which has a radial velocity semiamplitude of 43.9 km s@x wide binaries ( wbs ) are binary star systems in which the secondary star is orbited by a much more massive ( @xmath0m@xmath1 ) primary star .<n> they are common in the galactic disk , but they are also found in the halo , in globular clusters , and in the thin - disk population of early - type galaxies . here<n> we report on a survey for wide binaries in the disk of the milky way ( mw ) using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) . to search for such systems , we cross - correlate _ hipparcos _ positions with the positions of stars in the mw lightcurves , as well as their proper motions , optical - to - infrared colors , luminosities and angular separations . in total<n> we find 347 candidate wide binaries , including 10 triples and 1 quadruple . of these ,<n> 347 are expected to be chance alignments ; the remainder are likely to be wide binaries as well . <n> _<n> introduction._observation and interpretation of we report the results of a search for pairs with non - _ hipparcos _ secondaries in the color - magnitude diagrams of the gc04 catalog of globular clusters ( gc ) .<n> we find 130 new wide binary systems , bringing the total number of known wide binary pairs with no _hipparcos<n> _ companion stars to 431 . of these ,<n> 400 were listed in luyten s lds catalog , some 134 were also listed in gc 04 , and 26 additional pairs are listed here for the first time . <n> the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of gc stars are drawn from a grid of stellar evolution models , which are based on the hamiltonian of the stars themselves ( @xmath0 ) and on their spectral energy distributions ( seds)@xcite . for each star in the cmd , there is a  companion '' star that is either a main -

type dwarfs , with a distribution in absolute magnitudes and distances which is consistent with that of the field population of single stars . <n> the existence of wide binaries with separations less than 10 pc is a result of two factors . first , the distribution in angular separation is quite broad , extending down to angular separations of only a few arcseconds , which is just beyond the luminosity function peak of low - mass red dwarfs ( @xcite ) . in the second case ,<n> the distribution of separations in the lspm - north catalog yields a limiting absolute magnitude which is dependent on the distance of the pair ; if we restrict our sample to objects within @math1 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be nearly complete down to the magnitude limit of this catalog . if , on the other hand , we restrict to objects located within @x <n> 7 pc and less than a few parsecs of one another , our census should be complete for objects with masses @ we report the results of a search for wide ( @xmath0 ) hydrogen -

sequence stars is correlated with mass ,<n> the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as cpm secondaries than they are in the field population . one possible interpretation is that the formation mechanisms for wide binaries are biased against secondaries of very low mass or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries . in either case , gravitational interactions with the environment disrupt a number of systems over time , in events we report the results of a survey for companions to nearby main sequence stars with proper motion @xmath0 , parallaxes , and proper motion errors better than 10% .<n> the survey was carried out with the michigan / magellan fiber interferometer ( mfifi ) on the magellan telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , chile . in total , 3,041 stars north of the celestial equator with parallaxes and proper motions greater than 10% were surveyed . among these stars ,<n> 3,042 were found to be wide binaries , i.e. multiples with separations in excess of 10 au . <n> the frequency distribution of wide binaries is consistent with the hypothesis that wide binaries are common in stellar systems with normal , nearby _ hipparcos _ stars primaries . at the distance of the sun , these multiples have typical magnitudes of g dwarfs and distances between 1.4pc and 62.9pc . #<n> 1to 0pt#1 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7 to#2 ' '' '' we report the discovery of a new class of binary star systems in which the primaries are main - sequence stars .<n> the systems are selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) based on their high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise ratio light curves , and their high orbital separations ( @xmath0 au ) . <n> the primary stars in these systems are mostly solar - type objects , with projected separations between 0@xmath1 and 0@math2 . at separations larger than 0@xi<n> , we find that the distribution of projected separation is consistent with _ pik s law_. at smaller separations ,<n> our data are not consistent with the well - known law , but are consistent with it if we allow for the possibility that the orbital plane is random . in a binary star system , _<n> i.e. _ the primary star is a dwarf star , the secondary star s orbital period and the projected separation between the two stars are the parameters that determine the binary s formation and evolution . the orbital period of the system is measured from _ hipparcos _ data  we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars .<n> we find no evidence for cpm companions , and set an upper limit to the fraction of wide pairs ( @xcite : cg04 ) that is consistent with _ pik s law_. at small projected separations ,<n> our data are consistent with the well - known law , but only up to a projected separation of about 200 au . beyond that limit<n> , the distribution shows a sudden break . the latter can be fitted with a power index @x.2 , consistent with trends observed in both their disk and halo samples . a break in the distribution at large angular separations might indicate that star formation processes that initially yield a distribution of wide binary systems are hampered because of the disruptive effects of the environment in which the stars are born . we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations @xcite . we find that the observed luminosity function of the faint secondaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity functions of the field , single star population .<n> the secondaries , on the other hand , are dominated by fainter k - m dwarfs , with a range of absolute magnitude peaking at . we report the results of a search for wide pairs ( separations @xmath0 au ) among stars with low proper motions ( @xcite ) .<n> we identify 371 cpm pairs ( @ xmath1 ) with probable separations between 1 and 10 au , and we measure the projected separations of these pairs as a function of orbital phase . for systems with separations up to 10 au<n> , we observe a distribution in projected separation which is consistent with _ pik s law _ ( ds@xmath2 ds ) for orbital separations in the range 10 au to 10 kpc . beyond that range , the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a power law , with the slope decreasing as a power of the angular separation . at large angular separations ,<n> the distribution of separations follows that of the projected distribution , but at smaller separations the distribution breaks down into a single power law with an exponent @xxmath3 . <n> the binary frequency thus appears to have a break at large separations and we suggest that the break occurs as interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they we report the results of a proper motion survey with the schmidt telescope of six wide ( @xmath0pc ) binary systems from the lds catalogue of luyten , minnes , and wiseman ( 1987 ) .<n> the proper motions of the stars range from 18 to 18 , with a median value of 18 . of these six systems ,<n> only one has a common proper motion ( s@xmath1 ) larger than 2 , while the other three have s @ xmath2 . <n> the low - mass stars in these systems have a wide range of angular separations , ranging from a few arcseconds to a few tens of arcseconds . at separations<n> _ less than _ 10 au , the companions are almost certainly main - sequence stars , but at larger separations they are most likely white dwarfs . in the larger separation regime , _ pik s law _ can be consistently applied to model the distribution of separations in this regime ; however , there is a significant degeneracy between the proper motion of the primary and the eccentricity of the secondary . we present the results of a survey for variable stars using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> we find that the fraction of variable stars that are blue , x - ray detected , early - type stars increases with increasing wavelength , from @xmath0% for the bluest objects to @xcite ( bx - v ) = + 0.2 for the most luminous objects . <n> the number of variable star candidates found in sddss is higher than expected based on the number counts alone , and we attribute this to the non - detection of blue objects , which are thought to be more numerous at higher redshifts . in the case of objects with blue colors , the number is expected to be higher than predicted , but we find no evidence for blue objects in any of the observed data , suggesting that the true number may be lower than expected . we present the results of a survey of early type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .<n> we find that a large fraction ( @xmath0 per cent ) of the early type galaxies show evidence for ao ia in their spectra . in most cases ,<n> the spectra are dominated by emission lines from the ionising source , but in a few cases the lines are seen to be blended with the stellar continuum . <n> we suggest that the presence of an ao variable in the spectrum may be responsible for the mixing , as the ao is expected to have a higher expansion velocity than the emission line . we present early results from a survey of subdwarf pairs made with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .<n> the pairs are made of two early type - ii supernovae ( sne ) with central black holes ( bhs ) of different masses . in most cases the pairs form in a short period of time ( @xmath0 1 day ) and the distance between the pair and the centre of the black hole is less than 100mpc . however , in a few cases pairs made in a single night are found to form with periods as short as a few hours . <n> the standard model ( sm ) predicts that pairs made by two bhs with the same mass can form if they have a common centre of mass smaller than a critical value , which depends on the initial period of the pair , the central black hole mass , and the angular momentum of the central object . if the central bh mass is smaller than the critical value the pair forms within a timescale of the order of a day , or less , while if it is larger the timescale is much shorter , then we present the results of a survey for subdwarfs in the galactic plane with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .<n> we find that the fraction of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is higher in the inner galaxy than in the outer region , as traced by the centroids of the agn surface brightness profiles , with a median value of @xmath0 for the inner and median values of @ x - ray surface brightness of the galaxies in our survey . <n> we also find that agn are more strongly concentrated towards the galactic centre than the outer parts of the galaxy , which is consistent with the idea that more than one agn contribute to the formation of the local agn population . we present first results from a survey of subdwarf gravitational lensing by extragalactic sources detected with the _ einstein _ and _ chandra _ x - ray telescopes .<n> the fraction of the total sky covered by lensing is found to increase with source redshift , with more than half of the objects showing redshifts greater than 0.1 . <n> the number density of sub - chandra / rosat sources with measured redshift is @xmath0 per 10 arcmin@xmath1 , which is much higher than that of any other source class . in our survey<n> , we found that about half of all sources with redshift greater than 0.2 have lensing - detected counterparts , while most of the other sources show no detectable lensing at all . using the data from the literature ,<n> we find that the number fraction of sources with lensing detections is higher than expected , especially for the most luminous sources , suggesting that there may be more than one source class with this property . to appear in apjl , proc . we present multi - epoch _ chandra _ acis - s observations of the gravitational lensing potentials of the central black holes at the centre of supermassive black holes down to redshifts of @xmath0 .<n> we find a number of potential lensing systems which are too faint to be detected by _<n> chandra_.<n> most of the systems are too close to the centre to be resolved into a pair of black holes . <n> black holes are among the most luminous objects in the universe , with luminosities in excess of 10@xmath1 erg / s . yet , despite their large masses , most black holes do not form in the centres of massive black holes @xcite . instead , their formation is usually associated with the collapse of gas and dust to black holes ( bhs ) , triggered by dynamical interactions between the bh and its host galaxy . in bh formation ,<n> the black hole mass is typically much smaller than the stellar mass of the host , and the bh mass is usually found to be in the range of a few to a few tens of solar masses . however , bhs form in a wide variety of we present preliminary results from a survey for subdwarfs at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) using the eso very large telescope .<n> we find that the fraction of high - redshift objects with detectable sub - dwarf emission is higher than expected from standard dust - subtraction techniques . in some cases , the fraction increases with increasing redshift , but in most cases the fraction is close to zero . <n> we also present new measurements of the sub - db flux ratios for a set of bright blue objects and find that they are consistent with the expected value of the standard dust model . we present the results of a survey of the galactic x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) using the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) .<n> we find that a large fraction ( @xmath0 per cent ) of the x - rays are emitted in the relativistic jets associated with the agn and show that most of the observed emission originates from relativistic jets . <n> we also find that the fraction of emission from relativistic agn is strongly correlated with the galactic centre s ( gc ) distance , with an average value of @xcite . in our survey of agn with gc distances between 10 and 100pc , we find a strong anti - correlation between the astrophysical parameters and the gc distance . for a gc separation of 100pc<n> , the average relativistic jet lorentz factor of the jets is -0.68 , while for a 10pc separation , it is + 0.23 , independent of the distance from the center of the agr . the average agn jet velocity , as measured by the azimuthal angle of the jet axis , is also anti - correlated with both the distance and the we show that the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) detected by _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ may contain hidden agn .<n> the agn may be ultraluminous x - rays ( ulxs ) , or alternatively may be accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs) . in the former case<n> , the luminosities of the sources may reach @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , while in the latter case they may be as faint as @xcite . <n> the recent discovery of _<n> xmm_- newton ( xnd ) with a bright , compact central source at the center of a seyfert 2 galaxy , rxte j1550 - 564 , has raised many questions about the nature of the central source , including whether it is an agn or a supergiant black hole . to answer these questions ,<n> it is important to study the properties of the compact central object , in particular , its mass , temperature , and mass - luminosity relation , as well as its mass function .",

compact metrics with a combinatorial structure that can be varied .<n> in particular , our results apply to metrics with metrics of the form , for example , of the following form : for every lorentzian metric @xcite , there is a finite , 2-dimensional simplicial complex and a smooth , minimal embedding such that the complement of this metric is a topologically complex . such embeddings maps would be interesting in the final part of our series or our series in general , but an existence and regularity theory for such minimizers does not exist in the author s knowledge and this number influences the bound in the area evolution estimate of the perturbed functional . <n> [ eq : approximateevolutionofa ] in this first of a series of three papers , the aim is to derive approximate evolution estimates for a class of perturbed functionals arising in the theory of gau - bonnet embeddings . for such functionals<n> , it is known that in @xcite , we derived an evolution estimate for the minimum of a perturbed functional @xmath0 on the complex plane . in this paper<n> we use this result to derive an infimal area estimate for simplicial complexes , i.e. a bound for the evolution of their minimal perturbed area .<n> this will then be used to obtain evolution estimates for the area of the sphere and the disk associated to a simplicial complex . this is the first in a series of papers that will prove that quantities of the type @xmath0 are lower semi - continuous in time under ricci flow with surgery and precise cutoff . in this paper<n> we will establish an approximate bound for the evolution of areas under such flows .<n> this result will be used in the proofs of other results in the series . <n> ricci flows are one of the simplest dynamical systems that can be used to study evolution in time of quantities that are not continuous on a manifold . they have been used extensively in the theory of dynamical systems and have been the subject of numerous papers in the past ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the most famous result in that theory is the so - called riemann - hilbert ( rh ) flow , which is the most studied version of the ricci - flow model . under the rh flow <n> there is a natural parameter that controls the evolution , called the flow exponent . for a general class of flows<n> this exponent is the square root of the time derivative of the area , i.e. it is equal to the logarithm of the inverse of the square of the ratio of the period of the flow in the first part of this series of papers we prove that the area of a minimal @xmath0-disk in a ( 3 dimensional ) ricci flow with surgery is monotonically non - increasing on the time - interval between the surgeries . in the second part of the paper<n> , we prove the analogous result for a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional flow . <n> ricci flows are one of the most studied flows in fluid mechanics .<n> they model , among other things , the transport of liquids , particles , vortices , magnetic flux , fluid flows and so on @xcite . the most famous flow in 3d<n> is the so - called kuramoto - sivashinsky - ricci ( ksr ) flow , which has been extensively studied in the last decades , both theoretically and experimentally . as a consequence ,<n> there is a strong theoretical foundation for the study of the asymptotic behavior of the area , volume , and other properties of minimal @ x - disks , @x<n> _ i.e. _ , of minimal spheres and disks . on the other hand , in spite of the fact that the in this paper we prove that the evolution of the curvature of a minimal disk bounded by a given loop of controlled geodesic curvature is monotonically non - increasing in @xmath0 away from the singular times .<n> more precisely , we show that for a given surgery time , the area evolution of minimal disks that are bounded by the geodesic curvature of the surgery time is bounded from below by the logarithm of the area of the minimal disk . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the study of surgery times is motivated by the need to understand the behavior of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) , which describe the evolution in time of a large class of dynamical systems , such as neural networks @xcite , neural networks with bifurcations , cellular automata and , more generally , networks of interacting elements . in this context , it is natural to ask whether or not a surgery time can be decomposed into a sequence of smaller surgery times , each of which has a different curvature , and if so , under which geometric properties of the resulting pde are monotonicly non - differentiable in the sense of the lower semi - continuity of the sequence . the main result of this paper we prove a theorem on the long - time existence of time - stationary minimal disks in ( 3 dimensional ) ricci flows with surgery .<n> we also show that the area evolution of these disks is non - increasing on time . <n> let @xmath0 be a 3 dimensional time - dependent ricci flow with surgery and precise cutoff and closed time - slices , defined on the time interval . in @xcite<n> , we proved that for all time - intervals , the minimal areas of all smooth maps of the flow , restricted to a disk bounded by a given loop of geodesic curvatures , grow at most polynomially . here<n> we prove that for any constant time - interval , there exists a non - trivial time - dependence of the areas of the minimal disks , constrained to lie in a disk of area at most as large as the geodesic curvature of the loop . as a consequence ,<n> we show that there are no time - periodic embedded , disjoint loops of length arbitrarily large that are contractible in time and stationary in time ( i.e. between two surgery times , they are disjoint to a fixed loop ) . the proof is based on the estimate of the area we prove that the volume of a flat riemannian disk of finite volume is bounded from above by a constant independent of the dimension of the target manifold .<n> we also prove the analogous result for hyperbolic disks . <n> let @xmath0 be a compact , smooth , connected manifold of characteristic zero , defined on the unit circle , with finitely many connected components @xcite . in this paper , we prove the following dichotomy . on the one hand , if @x , then there is a one - to - one correspondence between the volumes of the interior and exterior regions of the disk . moreover , on the other hand<n> , there is an inverse correspondence , which we call the _ volume bound _ , between the spaces of solutions of the klein - gordon equation and the target manifolds of the hyperbolic equations of motion . the volume bound is a fundamental result in the theory of hyperbolic geometry and it is a key ingredient in the construction of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation , a fundamental object in the study of the geometry of closed orientable surfaces . as such , it is natural to ask whether @x we prove that the geodesic curvatures of the evolsphere and the hyperbolic plane are equal .<n> we also show that the image of a flat riemannian disk whose geodesic curvature is bounded by @xmath0 is a target whose image is a conformal harmonic embedding . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the geometry of celestial bodies is one of the oldest and best studied problems in celestial mechanics . in this paper<n> , we consider a very simple case : that of a spherically symmetric target , which is the interior of an axisymmetric flat disk whose boundary is a hyperbolic plane . for a spherical target<n> it is well - known that the interior sectional curvatures are not larger than the corresponding ambient curvatures . on the other hand ,<n> the case of a hyperbolic target is much more complicated : one needs to consider curvatures on both sides of the object , as well as on its boundary , to determine the shape of the target . as is well known , for a large class of spherical targets , the ambient curvature is not a constant ; it is a function of the distance from the center of the sphere to the boundary . moreover , it is in this paper we prove new lower bounds on the area and the speed of propagation of a lorentz - invariant invariant soliton propagating in a sphere .<n> these bounds are sharp in the sense that they do not depend on the shape of the sphere , but only on its curvature . as a consequence ,<n> we are able to show that the speed and the area of propagation are bounded by the product of the two invariants , which is a new , sharp bound . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of the propagation of an invariant vector field in a topological space has a long history . in the 19th century , haglund and leibbrandt proved the existence of the invariant , the so - called _ invariant mass _ , and conjectured that this vector field is invariant under the action of the unit normal vector field along the boundary of the space . since then , invariant masses have been proved in many different contexts , including in the context of riemannian geometry @xcite , schrdinger s lagrangian waves in @xmath0-dimensional spacetimes , to name a few . in this paper we prove a theorem on the number of differentiable maps from locally finite simplicial complexes into manifolds . <n> the _ boundary _ @xmath0 of a simplicial complex is the set of all nonzero edges of the complex that are contained in a fixed number of other simplices .<n> we prove that every differentiability map that is a map from the complex into a manifold has the following property : if the boundary is _ big _ , i.e. if it is contained in more than one simplice , then the map is also big . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain that every map from a simpliical complex to a manifold of dimension at most two has the same dimension as the boundary of the manifold . for manifolds , we show that any map that has this property also has the property that it is also _big_. we also show that if the dimension of a manifold is at most three , there is a natural map from simplicial structures into manifolds with the property , that is , if the map has the additional property of being _ large_. the main result of this paper is as follows : the following statement is true  in this paper we prove a conjecture of sidoravicius and visser which states that every contractible loop on a @xmath0-dimensional compact riemannian manifold has an area - minimizer within the same homotopy class of contractible curves .<n> we also show that this conjecture is true for piecewise smooth continuous maps . <n> [ section ] [ thm]lemma [ tm]proposition [ stm]corollary [ theorem]conjecture the following conjecture was recently proved by two of the authors : @xcite . here we will state a more general statement : _ every ( compact ) contractible curve on a riemanian manifold is area - minimizing _ ,<n> i.e. it is the area of every ( contractible ) loop that is continuously differentiable on the interior of the manifold and is smooth away from finitely many points . in this note<n> we will fix the following notation : for every continuous contractible ( piecewise -

evolution under the action of a non - linear second - order ordinary differential equation .<n> we also show that the same result holds for the evolution of area - minimizing sequences on the @xmath0-skeleton of the complex . <n> the study of evolutions of dynamical systems is one of the cornerstones of modern mathematical physics . in particular ,<n> area - evolving differential equations ( e.g. the kirchhoff equation @xcite , the riemann - hilbert problem ( rhm ) , or the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hce ) @x ) have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years , both for their own sake as well as for their application to a wide range of problems in physics , ranging from fluid dynamics to cellular automata . the goal of this paper is to provide a general method for proving that a dynamical system evolves in a certain sense , i.e. that the evolution is area evolving , in the following sense : we will show that for a given area evolution , there is an evolution under an action of the second let @xmath0 be the geodesic curvature field of the unit square lattice of euclidean space with boundary . in this paper<n> we prove that there is a unique minimizer of the sum of the jacobi polynomials of the first two terms of the boundary value problem on the unit cubic lattice .<n> more precisely , we show that there exists a minimizer along the boundary of the minimizer that is a convex hull , a concave hull that is smooth on all but finitely many vertices and whose boundary is a riemann sphere . <n> the _ boundary value _ problem in boundary value theory is the study of the behavior of the solutions in the presence of boundary symmetries and their relations to boundary conformal field theories ( cfts ) @xcite . for a boundary cft the boundary condition to be non - negative is that the hamiltonian has at least one eigenvalue that is either zero or one of two negative values . on the other hand , for a _ conformal _ cft , the boundary conditions must be positive , that is , they must take the value of one of the two positive eigenvalues . the existence of a we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) family @xmath0 of faces of the unit cube and its boundary .<n> each face is equipped with a parameterization by a compactness parameterization , and the boundary is allowed to have self - intersections . in this paper , we study mapping properties of this 1d family to a continuous one . more specifically ,<n> we are interested in the case in which the boundary and interior of each face are allowed to be differentiable , smooth embeddings , or to be continuous and homotopic to each other . <n> the main result of this paper is the existence of a minimal model for the mapping of the 1d face family onto a continuous map , which we call a _ minimizer _ , that homotopically approximates the mapping to a smooth embedding of the interior of the face . as a corollary<n> we obtain a new proof of a classical result about mappings of the plane into the plane , namely that the plane is isometric to a compact riemannian manifold when restricted to a single face and the compactness of the ambient space is bounded by a factor that depends only on the dimension of the family and the volume of in this paper we introduce a new class of convex polytopes which we call @xmath0-polytopes .<n> we study the structure of the faces of this class . in particular , we prove the existence of a _ minimal _ polytope , that is , a polytope which is indistinguishable relative to a given set of faces . as a consequence ,<n> we obtain a new proof of the fact that every face of the class is convex . <n> the notion of a minimal polytope was introduced in @xcite , where it was shown that every polytope can be parameterized by a convexity parameter . here<n> we generalize the notion to arbitrary convex structures , in particular to the class of faces of the above class , which we will denote by _ lems _<n> ( see definition [ def : simpl complex ] ) . the _ minimum lem ]<n> is defined as follows . for every face<n> , there is an interval @x to m$ ] such that for every edge @ x , the restriction @x_2 $ ] converges pointwise to a lipschitz map in this note we prove a new isoperimetric inequality .<n> let @xmath0 be the maximum euclidean norm of the component of all points on the upper semicircle of a rectifiable loop restricted to the lower semi circle of the loop . denote by @xxmath1 the maximum of the euclidian norm of its component . <n> the following statement states : @xmath2 denote the speed of convergence of the bifurcation set of the boundary of the upper half -

orbit interaction . for this reason , it is of great interest to investigate the in this work , we investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate in the framework of the falicov - kimball approximation ( fsa ) .<n> we derive the bloch - redfield equation for the reduced density matrix within the fsa approximation , and solve it numerically for the case of a two - component fermi gas with repulsive interactions . in the thermodynamic limit ,<n> we find that thermal fluctuations stabilize the condensate against the onset of incoherent dynamics . <n> pacs numbers : 03.75.fi , 05.30.fk , 67.40.vs , 68.35.rh in recent years<n> , quantum information processing has been the subject of intensive studies @xcite , due to its potential applications in cryptography , dense coding , as well as in the field of quantum computing and quantum communication . among these applications , one of the most promising is quantum error correction ( qec)@xcite which promises to reduce the error in a quantum teleportation protocol by a factor of @xmath0 compared to classical teleportation . as a first step in this direction , in refs.@x we study the dynamics of a two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the presence of an external magnetic field by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the time - dependent bec in the framework of the first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) .<n> the gpe is solved in the born - oppenheimer approximation ( fsa ) at zero temperature . in the weak magnetic field limit<n> , we find that the bec can be described by a generalized bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory , while in the strong magnetic field regime the bdg theory is found to be in good agreement with the results obtained from the fsa in the low temperature approximation . <n> recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of quantum degenerate atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite , due to their potential applications in the field of quantum information and quantum computing . among the various atomic gases ,<n> one of the most interesting systems is the two - component bec which is composed of a spin - orbit ( so ) coupled condensate and a spinless fermi gas ( fg ) @x we propose a scheme to create a non - classical light - shining state .<n> the scheme is based on the interaction of a single two - level atom with a single mode of a laser field . by varying the intensity of the laser field<n> , we can control the direction of the light polarization , which can be achieved by tuning the strength of the interaction . for a strong interaction ,<n> the two light modes are decoupled and their polarizations can be tuned by the laser intensity . as a result , the system can be continuously tuned from a classical state to a nonclassical state , with a high degree of sensitivity . <n> the study of nonclassical states of light has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in nonclassical systems , there is no stable ground state and the state can not be manipulated . on the other hand , in classical systems<n> there is a well - known ground state which is stable for a large range of interaction strengths , and can be controlled by external parameters such as laser field @xmath0 , electric field , frequency , or temperature . the nonclassical ground state has been observed in a number of experiments , such as t we propose a new approach to study the dynamics of a quantum particle in a curved space - time .<n> the particle is initially prepared in a quasi - one - dimensional system , and then it is allowed to move freely in the curved spacetime . using this approach ,<n> we show that the quantum state of the particle can be controlled by the curvature of the spacetime and that the particle motion can be monitored by measuring the position of the measured quantum state . <n> _ introduction _ in recent years , a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of quantum mechanics in curved spacetimes @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that the motion of a classical particle in such a spacetime can be described by means of the quantum version of maxwell s equations . on the other hand , in the presence of other forces , such as gravity , electromagnetism , or turbulence , quantum mechanics is no longer applicable . as a result , various quantum phenomena , including superconductivity , bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity , have been observed in different types of spacetime geometries and at different scales . among these , there is a growing we report on the experimental realization of a two - photon raman transition in a three - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) system .<n> the transition is observed in a si / tio@xmath0 double quantum dot coupled to a @xmath1-type two - level atom , where the atom - atom interaction is reduced to a single - particle interaction in the absence of the coupling between the two levels . in the presence of this interaction ,<n> the dot forms a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - orbit - coupled spin - singlet ( sssc ) state , which is characterized by a spin - dependent effective mass , and a singlet - triplet excitation gap . <n> topological insulators ( tis ) are a new quantum state of matter with a bulk electronic band gap and protected gapless spin states @xcite . due to their unique properties , tis have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation . the first experimental realizations of tis were reported in the late 70 s @x<n> . however , it was not until the early 80 s that a 2d tis was realized in a semiconductor microcavity @x we propose a simple and efficient scheme for the experimental realization of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - boson model . in this model ,<n> the coupling between the spin and the electromagnetic field is neglected .<n> we show that the spin - field interaction can be efficiently manipulated by the hamiltonian of the system , leading to the generation of spin - singlet and spin - triplet excitations , as well as the observation of topological phase transitions . <n> recently , a new field of quantum information has emerged @xcite , which is based on the study of quantum many - body systems coupled to the environment . at the heart of this new field<n> is the concept of quantum entanglement , the physical manifestation of the quantum correlation between a system and its environment , that has recently been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation @xmath0 . here<n> , we present a very efficient and simple scheme to realize a novel type of entanglement between two quantum systems , namely , an entangled spin system coupled to an electromagnetic field . using this scheme , it is possible to generate a new type of entangled state , called the topological phase transition ( tpt ) , and to we study the ground state properties of the tian - lloyd model on the simple cubic lattice .<n> we find that the model exhibits a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from an ising - like to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state , with the critical exponent @xmath0 in the ising limit . in the presence of a magnetic field ,<n> the af ground state is unstable with respect to the first order transition to a paramagnetic ( pm ) state . <n> the quantum phase diagram ( qpd ) of the simple model tian , lloyds , and orlando@xcite ( timo ) on the cubic lattice has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite . here<n> , we focus on the model for the case when the lattice constant is smaller than or equal to one , which is a typical situation in nature . using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , the ground - state energy and the first - order transition temperature of the system<n> are calculated , as well as the phase diagram of the model in the temperature range from 0 to 1000 k. the we study the non - equilibrium steady state of a dissipative quantum system described by the kleff - kehrein - von delft equation .<n> the model system consists of a one - dimensional chain of lennard - jones ( lj ) oscillators interacting via the coulomb repulsion . in the classical limit ,<n> the steady state is characterized by the vanishing of the specific heat and the scaling of the steady - state correlation function with system size @xmath0 . for small values of the repulsion<n> , we find that the correlation function decays algebraically , while for large values of repulsion we find a power - law decay . <n> the study of the nonequilibrium steady state ( nea ) of many - body quantum systems is an active area of research in statistical mechanics @xcite . the interest for nea is twofold : first , it is motivated by the possibility of observing the nea in the thermodynamic limit of small system sizes , and second , because it is a paradigmatic model for studying nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in condensed - matter systems , e.g. , in the context of phase transitions . here , the interest is we study the dissipative dynamics of a two - level system in the presence of an external periodic potential .<n> the potential is assumed to be proportional to the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which describes the time evolution of the two - particle distribution function in the absence of the interaction between the system and the external field . using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method ,<n> we calculate the steady - state distribution of the total number of particles , @xmath0 , as a function of the strength of the potential and the temperature of the system . for a strong potential<n> , we find a power - law dependence @xcite , similar to the well - known blum - bloch - siegert ( bbs ) distribution , but for a weaker potential , the bbs distribution is not universal and depends on the system parameters , such as the strength and the shape of the interactions between the two particles . <n> the study of quantum dissipation is one of the most fundamental problems in physics , with potential applications in a wide range of areas , from condensed - matter physics to quantum information processing . in recent years we study the quantum statistical properties of a two - level atom interacting with a laser field .<n> we show that the distribution of the number of photons emitted in the laser field and the spectral properties of the emitted light are affected by the density of states of the atom . as a result ,<n> the distribution is not a simple random variable . <n> pacs number(s ) : 42.50.dv , 42.25.bs , 42.65.hw , 73.40.gk the study of quantum properties of light has a long history . in 1940 , bloch and siegert @xcite showed that photons can be mapped onto each other , forming the basis of the so -

hadron colliders ( e.g. , lhc ) is an important tool for the exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms and the determination of the scale of qcd scale parameters @xcite . among the various approaches , the one based on the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) which has been applied successfully at rhic and lhc is based on a large set of montecarlo we present the analysis of the production of the _ z _ boson at the tevatron and lhc energies , in the @xmath0 and @math1 formalisms , as well as in the d0 analysis .<n> we studied the influence of adding a next to leading order term in the monte carlo simulation for the processes , and in particular , the use of the nlo term , which is studied here in the n@xmath2 formalism , improving the prediction of the cross sections of the processes and the behaviour of the physics observables in the region of higher transverse momentum , compared to the calculations in leading order without the correction . the implementation of the matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism also improves the description of the data in the high transverse momentum region . in this work , we present an analysis of the _ z _ boson production in proton - proton collisions at lhc first run energy ( 7 tev ) , using the monte carlo event generators @xmath0 ( nlo ) and @xcite , and the tevatron ( fermilab ) muon analysis in the electron channel .<n> we compare the results obtained using the different event generators , including the effects of the matrix element correction in the parton shower formalism , multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) model , leading jet and leading jet pseudorapidity in the region of low transverse momentum , as well as the effect of the extrapolation based on theory , such as the mpi model and the muon channel results . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in the analysis , some kinematic quantities have a different prediction from the two event generators when compared to the simulation without the correction , like the low region of the transverse momentum and the leading jet in the low absolute value of transverse momentum in the leading jets simulation and the behaviour of the sum of all jets in the event in the high transverse momentum region in the @ we compare the @xmath0 _ _ z__+3 jets and the monte carlo ( mc ) samples generated by @xcite , with an emphasis on jet physics at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> the mc samples are generated using the _<n> z _ boson exchange model ( mpi ) at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant ( lc ) and using the hybrid mpi / lc@xmath1 ( hc1 ) model in the parameter space of the boson masses . <n> the first results of the comparison for 7 tev lhc energy ( first run energy ) are presented . for the boson transverse momentum ( _z _ @x<n> ) range of the study , we find that the mpi model gives a better description of the jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in the region of low _ x _ and _ y _ values , and of the cross section of jet production , when compared to the lc and mpi simulations . [ cols= \"  \" , ] for the mc simulations , we present a study of the _ z _ @xmath0 and _<n> z_@xmath1 production in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron , focusing on the systematic difference in the description of the transverse momentum of the particles in the event , and of the leading jet .<n> we perform some studies to isolate the different effects of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) and hard scatters . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] with the high statistics data collected at the lhc , it is possible to study the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high energy @xcite . in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,<n> the main features of the qgp are well established : quarks and gluons are confined in a hadronic matter , with a temperature and a chemical potential close to those of the hot and dense qcd medium , the so - called _ qcd vacuum_. at high energies , hard partons ( hs ) are produced , mainly by gluons and quarks produced in the initial stages of the collision , in a we perform a model independent analysis of the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) limits on the mass of the z boson , @xmath0 , as a function of the number of transverse momenta of the bosons .<n> the analysis is performed in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . for the first time<n> , we show that the mpi model , in which the _ z _ boson is produced in a cascade with all the transverse momentum of the other particles in the cascade , is consistent with the available experimental data . <n> the mass and transverse momentum distributions of the top quark and the bottom quark at the lhc have been measured with great precision @xcite . in the standard model<n> ( sm ) of particle physics , the masses of the quarks and leptons are given by the sum of their decay constants , and the masses and couplings of the gauge bosons are determined by the parameters of the theory , such as the gauge couplings and the ckm matrix elements . however , there are we present an analysis of @xmath0 collision data with the aim of constraining the size of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .<n> the analysis is based on the measurement of the two - particle correlation between the electron and muon jets , and on the study of the three - jet structure function . <n> the muonic charge asymmetry is a fundamental property of the universe . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the charge asymmetry of the electron is given by @xcite , while the charge of the neutron is given in terms of its charge in the proton , the electron - proton charge asymmetry ( e - pa ) . as a consequence<n> , there is a tension between the sm and theories of elementary particle interactions , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) and gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) that has been proposed to explain the origin of the electric dipole moment ( e.g. , see refs . and , respectively , refs<n> . for recent reviews ) for the electron ( or muon)-nucleon we present an analysis of the di - jet invariant mass distribution in @xmath0 , based on the first data taken with the detector in run ii of the tevatron @xcite .<n> the analysis is performed in the same kinematic region of the detector , but with a different set of cuts , leading to a reduction of systematic uncertainties by a factor of two . <n> the study of di - jets is important for lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) studies , which are becoming an increasingly important part of neutrino physics phenomenology . in the standard lepton model ( sm ) ,<n> the dominant decay channels for di - hadrons are @ x - ray , photons , and neutrinos , while in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) decay channels , the leading jet is the only decay channel . as a consequence , lfvs of the lepton flavour violating ( lff ) processes are expected to be strongly suppressed in the sm . however , there is no direct evidence for the suppression of the lff processes in the existing data , so it is not clear if the suppression is due to new physics . we present an analysis of the dijets in @xmath0 collisions at 13 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and compare it with the analysis of jets at the fermilab tevatron .<n> the analysis is performed in full qcd with the monte - carlo event generators pythia andburner . <n> the study of dijet events at the lhc is important for two reasons . on the one hand ,<n> one can test the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , which has been proven to be correct up to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite . at the same time<n> , it is important to understand the origin of non - sm particles , such as quarks and gluons , in the sm . in this letter<n> we present a study of jets in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum ( dm - ii ) at the upgraded lhc in order to test the sm in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) ( see refs . and , respectively , the references in the text  we study the drell yan production at the tevatron in the framework of @xmath0 , @xcite , mpi , and the ue ( drell - yan + multiple parton interactions ) models .<n> we find that , in the balance , the mpi model gives better description of the boson production , especially in the lower boson transverse momentum region . <n> [ cols= \"  \" ,<n> ] in the past few years , a lot of work has been done to understand the production mechanism of the drel yan bosons at the lhc . in refs.@xcite<n> , it was found that the bosons are produced mainly in the forward rapidity region ( _ z _ ) , with the transverse momentum of the leptons being in the range of 2 - 5 gev@xmath1 , while the invariant mass distribution of the hadrons is extended to 4 - 6 tev , as expected from the large hadron collider ( lhcr ) energy regime . at the same time , there are indications of the possible existence of additional bosons in the we present a study of the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution of charged leptons produced in association with a top quark and a jet at tevatron and lhc energies .<n> the study is performed in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and includes the effects of three - body decays of the lepton pairs . <n> we find that the measured bosonic branching ratios are consistent with the theoretical expectation of a top - quark pair decaying into a light charged lepton pair , and that the relative size of the leading and next - to - leading bosonic jets in the final state is in agreement with the expectation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , top quarks decay into a pair of bottom quarks and a light higgs boson @xcite . at high energies ,<n> the number of the bottom quark pairs is expected to be very large , leading to a very clean leptonic decay channel , which allows for a clean measurement of the cp violation in the decay . however , in the sm , it is not known whether the cp phase of the decay is @x we perform a series of monte carlo simulations of z boson production at the tevatron and the lhc .<n> we use the mpi algorithm to produce jets with different angular distributions from the hard process and from the z boson , and compare the results to the recent measurements by the cdf and d0 collaborations . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we find that the three - jet model ( 3slices ) @xcite , which has been successfully applied to the _ cdf _ and _ d0 _ measurements of the mass and the width of the boson @xmath0 , also works very well for the z _ events . for the boson _ z<n> _<n> , we find a good description of the jet angular distribution , with the leading jet having a very narrow angular distribution and a very large angular spread . on the other hand , the jet from mpi<n> is clearly producing additional jets with a different angular distribution to the jets from hard process . as a result of these additional jets ,<n> the ratio of the total number of jets from the two processes is not very sensitive to the parameters of the  we perform a monte - carlo study of particle production in _ z _ collisions at the tevatron , including both leading and next - to - leading order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .<n> we find that particle production is strongly affected by the mpi model , especially in the low transverse momentum region . <n> one of the most important issues for the lhc is to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the standard model ( sm )<n> , it is well known that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed in the early stage of the evolution of the hot and dense matter created in high energy nuclear collisions . at the same time , in the framework of beyond - the - standard - model ( bsm ) scenario , the quarks and gluons are formed in a super - dense medium , and the qgp is formed , through the interaction of quarks with gluons , at very high energy scale , @xmath0 @xcite . as a result , a large number of particles are produced in the final state : quarks , gluons and their superpartners we report on the qcd matrix elements and truncated showers used in the event generation for cdf and d0 at the tevatron collider .<n> we use leading jet rapidity for jet cuts on tranverse momentum of 5 gev , and analysis cuts on the scale of 2.5 gev ( @xmath0 has default parameters ) . <n> = 1 address = physics department , brookhaven national laboratory the cdf and d0 experiments at the fermilab tevatron collider have measured a variety of observables related to the properties of the strongly -

Additionallyif the saxion decays after becoming non - relativistic , we obtain @xmath307    now let us see that the susy axion model can realize the cases 1 and 2 studied in and , respectively .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the role of @xmath115 is played by the pq scalar , @xmath241 and @xmath308 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\after the pq phase transition , they decay into particles in the axion multiplet , which are thermalized due to their self interactions .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\( here , we assume that the thermal bath of the pq sector particles are sequestered from that of the visible sector . ) at some point , the interactions of the pq sector particles become very weak .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\then , the mean free path of the axion and saxion becomes so long that they behave as dark radiation @xmath78 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\after some periods , the saxion decays into smaller than the hubble expansion rate . suburso axion , saxion and axino freely stream and hence behave as dark radiation . suburso axion , saxion and axino freely stream and hence behave as dark radiation . subur* if the field @xmath241 or @xmath242 couples to the higgs sector , the saxion can mainly decays into the higgs bosons . suburthe saxion decays at @xmath312gev before it becomes massive . suburthe saxion decays at @xmath312gev before it becomes massive . suburthis eliminates about one - third of dark radiation . suburif the axino also decays without dominating the universe , @xmath313 at the present universe . suburthe features of the gw spectrum expected with the above setup are the same as , but the positions of the characteristic wavenumber are different . in , @xmath314 and @xmath315 is assumed while in the present setup they become @xmath316 and @xmath317 . subura sample parameter set corresponding to the case 2 is , @xmath318 which gives @xmath319 the cosmological evolution goes as follows . suburthe pq sector is assumed while in the present setup they become . with a proper choice of parameters , we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , and it soon decays into visible radiation . with a proper choice of parameters , we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath326 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath322 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath327 , and we consider a susy majoron model  @xmath328 , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism  @xmath329 , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism  @xmath322 previously defined . embodimentslet us define the quantity @xmath216 , which parameterize the latter dilution : @xmath323 this determines the ratio of the spectral height at @xmath215 to that at @xmath324 .    the first example in the case 5 discussed in is realized with the following parameters : @xmath325 which result rupture* after the phase transition , almost all the vacuum energy goes to the saxion coherent oscillation . suburthe heavy quarks remain massive since is satisfied . suburthe heavy quarks remain massive since is satisfied . subur* the coherent oscillation dilutes the radiation by a factor of @xmath330 , and it soon decays into visible radiation . suburnext , we consider a susy majoron model  @xcite . suburthe mass of the right - handed neutrino , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism @xcite , can be generated as a consequence of u(1 ) symmetry breaking . suburthis u(1 ) may be identified as a gauged @xmath331 symmetry , or it can be global lepton number symmetry . here we consider the former option . suburthen a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson appears which is associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the u(1 ) global symmetry . suburthis ng boson is called majoron . subur( we call other fields in the majoron supermultiplet as smajoron , which is a real scalar field , and majorino , which is the fermionic superpartner of the majoron . ) suburlet us consider the following the u(1 ) symmetry breaking scale , is not severely constrained in contrast to the pq scale .    in the following , we assume that the majoron and the right - handed neutrinos are initially in the thermal bath . explan( we use the same notation as in the previous section for @xmath260 , @xmath336 , @xmath178 , @xmath198 and @xmath322 . ) explannow let us see that the susy majoron model can realize the case 3 and 4 studied in and . explanfor the case 3 , we take the following parameters : @xmath337 then , we obtain @xmath338 the cosmological evolution goes as follows :    * after the phase transition , the radial oscillation of @xmath241 and @xmath308 quickly decays into the majoron sector .

order partial derivatives on the interior of the unit square @xmath23 .    as previously , it readily follows from ( [ eqn : normfsttilde2 ] ) that @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is an expression of the same type as ( [ eqn : biasctilde1 ] ) , this time involving the partial derivatives of @xmath16 up to the fourth order . extinglike above , it can be shown that resorting to pseudo - observations does not affect these properties . extingthis , however , requires a condition on the bandwidth ( @xmath202 ) slightly stronger than previously . extinggiven that the bias order is reduced to @xmath191 , the optimal bandwidth order is now seen to be @xmath203 , so that the bandwidth requirement does still include that optimal order . exting[ thm : ctilde2 ] under the assumptions of proposition [ thm : fshat ] and assumption [ ass : cop4 ] , if @xmath123 with @xmath204 as @xmath74 , the ` improved ' local log - quadratic probit - negative integral powers @xmath210 , and all those functions tend to 0 as @xmath211 . suburhence , @xmath201 may actually tend to 0 towards the boundaries , and the bias there be actually of order @xmath212 . suburagain , this will be the case where @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply when approaching the boundary . suburthe expression of the variance is the same as that for @xmath213 and @xmath214 , except that it has been inflated by a factor @xmath215 . suburthis inflation factor is , also , a well - known feature in local polynomial modelling when fitting a higher - degree polynomial ( * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? this results in smoother estimates , visually more pleasant . suburthis results in smoother estimates , visually more pleasant . suburthis is clear in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] ( right panel ) , where @xmath205 is shown for the same data set as previously . suburagain , the bandwidth matrix in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) was chosen via the cross - validation method suggested in section [ sec : bandwidth ] . suburtheorems [ thm : ctilde1 ] and [ thm : ctilde2 ] reveal that the combination of probit transformation and local likelihood methods mostly cures the boundary bias problems for kernel copula density estimation . suburhowever , the fact remains that the suggested estimators have a variance behaving like @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 , as @xmath74 . suburhence , @xmath220 tends to grow unboundedly when @xmath145 approaches one of the boundaries . suburnote that this is also the case for other copula density estimators attempting to correct the boundary bias , see for instance ( * ? ? ? ? ) and @xcite who obtain similar unbounded boundary variance for the beta kernel and the bernstein estim math162 for some fixed value @xmath221 , take a local smoothing matrix defined as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the euclidean distance between @xmath67 and the @xmath216th closest observation out of the sample ( [ eqn : pseudosamp ] ) in @xmath50 . suburnow it is @xmath216 , or equivalently @xmath224 , that will play the role of the smoothing parameter in lieu of @xmath221 . suburif @xmath24 had a compact support , @xmath225 would be the proportion of observations actively entering the estimation of @xmath51 at any @xmath67  the interpretation roughly holds for the gaussian kernel as well . suburof course , @xmath223 depends on the sample and is a random quantity . suburalong the same lines as in @xcite , one can show that @xmath226 and , together with @xmath227 , that @xmath228 now , through ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , one directly gets , for all @xmath59 , @xmath229 unlike ( [ eqn : varinf ] ) , this is no more proportional to @xmath230 domain : local likelihood density estimators using @xmath216-nn bandwidth are , indeed , known to produce smoother estimates in the tails than their fixed - bandwidth counterparts , avoiding the occurrence of ` spurious bumps ' . suburhence the appropriateness of the method here . suburthis is illustrated in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] . suburagain , the previous simulated data set was used to produce the two ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimates shown in the middle ( local log - linear ) and the right panel ( local log - quadratic ) , but this time a @xmath216-nn - type unconstrained bandwidth matrix @xmath234 was used ( see section 4 for details ) . suburcompared to figure [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] , the estimates are much smoother along the boundaries now . suburfor instance , using a @xmath216-nn - bandwidth mostly corrects the kink previously observed in the @xmath235 corner . suburit is particularly clear for @xmath205 . suburthe value of @xmath225 selected for the case @xmath86 was 0.1871 , that for the case @xmath87 was 0.4976 section [ sec : realdat ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the behaviour of kernel estimators is known to be crucially dependent on their smoothing parameter , whose choice in practice is unanimously recognised as a very difficult problem , especially in more than one dimension . here an effective way for selecting a suitable bandwidth matrix @xmath236 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is suggested .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it can be understood that the diagonal elements @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath76 quantify the amount of smoothing applied in the directions of the main @xmath55- and @xmath13-axes , hence their values will drive the overall smoothness of the resulting estimate @xmath239 and eventually that of @xmath232 . on the other hand, @xmath240 sets the direction along which that smoothing mostly takes place in @xmath50 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\for instance , if @xmath24 is the bivariate gaussian kernel , the local weights around @xmath83 will be set by the elliptical contour lines of the @xmath241-distribution .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\if @xmath51 is stretched along a particular direction of @xmath50 , which will be the case if @xmath16 itself is so on * section 4.6 ) .    consider the principal components decomposition of the @xmath244-`data matrix ' @xmath245 . by construction , the @xmath246 s and @xmath247 s are centred , hence @xmath246 and @xmath247 sare centred , hence @xmath248 and @xmath249 , the score of the @xmath250th observation on the first and second principal components , are given by @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are the eigenvectors of @xmath254 .for the case of @xmath257 ,given that the transformation @xmath255 is only a linear reparametrisation of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 .in addition , it is well known that the samples @xmath258 and @xmath259 are uncorrelated , hence estimating @xmath257 via any kernel method from the sample @xmath260 can be based on a diagonal bandwidth matrix @xmath261 with little side effect .in addition , it is well known that the samples @x usual in cross - validation procedures , @xmath269 is the ` leave - one - out ' version of @xmath270 computed on all the observations but @xmath248 . Additionallythe value of @xmath263 can be found similarly , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 can be plugged into @xmath271 for proceeding to bivariate estimation of @xmath257 . however , optimal bandwidths for univariate density estimation are usually smaller than those for bivariate density estimation of @xmath257 . for the case explan@xmath86 ( local log - linear estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath272 for univariate density estimation and @xmath273 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local log - quadratic estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath272 for univariate density estimation and @xmath273 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local log - quadratic estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath274 for univariate density estimation and @xmath275 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local log - quad the data are transformed into the sample @xmath260 via ( [ eqn : pca ] ) .executethen , a suitable value of @xmath225 in the @xmath266-direction is computed as @xmath280 i.e.  exactly as in ( [ eqn : hcv ] ) but this time @xmath264 is the estimator based on the @xmath216-nn bandwidth @xmath225 . the value @xmath281 is computed in the same way .executedenote @xmath282 .executethen , the squared norm of a vector in the @xmath256-domain will be computed as @xmath283 the factor @xmath284 naturally adjusts , through the obtained close - to - optimal values of @xmath285 and @xmath281 , for the potential discrepancy in local geometry in the @xmath286- and @xmath287-directions .executethe bivariate estimation of @xmath257 at any @xmath288 is carried out using the @xmath289 nearest neighbours of @xmath290 , these being determined by the above distance . here , @xmath291 and @xmath292 , again for accounting for the difference in optimal @xmath225- ' vector is , therefore , @xmath295 . suburit is acknowledged that this procedure may lack of sufficient theoretical support . suburfor instance , it is known that pre - sphering the observations in the process of selecting the bandwidth matrix is justified only if the underlying density @xmath51 is bivariate normal , that is , in this framework , if @xmath16 is the gaussian copula . suburlikewise , choosing @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( or @xmath285 and @xmath281 ) independently via univariate procedures would be suitable in theory only if @xmath266 and @xmath267 were independent , not only uncorrelated . suburthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a heuristic , _ ad - hoc _ correction . having said this , it was found that this way of doing gave very reliable results , as illustrated in figures [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] and [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] in the simulation study and the real data analysis detailed in the next sections . suburthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a ite . suburit was the first attempt at nonparametric copula density estimation , and remains a common choice for ( ostensibly ) correcting boundary bias . suburit will , therefore , be taken as benchmark . subura first bandwidth matrix was obtained from the ` augmented ' data set ( made up of @xmath298 ` observations ' spread over an area 9 times bigger than @xmath23 ) via the normal reference rule , then the final matrix was obtained by multiplying the former by @xmath299 for adjusting for the effective sample size and range ;

this is , from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\unfortunately , one can show that the process of adding up more and more high curvature corrections does not lead to convergence towards a single solution , _meaning that , in the vicinity of the bounce , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .meaningthat , at a fixed order , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .meaningthat , at a fixed order , one can show that the process of adding up more and more high curvature corrections does not lead to convergence towards a single , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the three - curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , whereas even though the curvature may be negligible either in the remote past or in the future of the bounce , it has almost certainly no reason to be so in general . in this case , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes .a way out to the previous difficulties , which would permit to undertake a tractable analytical calculation of the power spectrum , is the following .far from the bounce , one usually considers the situation for which the curvature is small , even though the implementation of this particular point may not be in itself a trivial task . in this case, one can consider that , during the contracting and expanding phases , the spatial sections are essentially flat so that the well known results stemming from the theory of cosmological perturbations can be straightforwardly applied . in this case, one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes .then , the main question becomes the effect of the bounce itself on the pre - bounce power spectrum . in this case, one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more dominant mode after the bounce is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .-     _ a priori _ , the common view concerning these last possibilities is that the dominant mode in the contracting phase is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .-     _ a priori _ , the common view concerning these last possibilities is that the dominant mode in the contracting phase could acquire a scale invariant spectrum which is not conveyed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase because it turns out that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( `` @xmath6-mode inversion , '' the scale invariant piece is passed to the `` wrong mode '' in the expanding phase ) ;

one should then find that the transition matrix is essentially the identity ( de sitter ) plus some correction vanishing in the limit @xmath219 . in this section,we show in this section that the previous result can be understood in very simple terms and that the result of the previous section can be reproduced by a back - of - the - envelope calculation . in this section,the crucial observation is that the height of the potential @xmath313 diverges as @xmath161 goes to zero while its width shrinks to zero . in this section,this suggests that there is something like a dirac @xmath194-function at play . in this section, this is merely a computational artifact allowing an easy calculation of the effect . in this section,the true value of @xmath161 must be nonvanishing , although tiny , so the calculation of this section is accurate only for those modes interacting with the potential . therefore , the presence of the dirac distribution in no way implies the existence of a singular behavior either of the potential @xmath244 or of the modes @xmath314 themselves as long as @xmath315 . ] to study this point we calculate the integral of the potential . in this section,the integral of the potential @ and where the function @xmath320 is a representation of the dirac @xmath194-function , _@@@@@@@@i.e.  _ @xmath321 in a certain sense , the potential @xmath239 possesses divergences `` worst '' than a dirac @xmath194-function .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the equation of motion of the quantity @xmath96 can now be written as @xmath322u=0\\ , , \\ ] ] _@@@@@@@@i.e.  _ a well - known equation in the context of quantum mechanics .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the matching conditions are @xmath323=0 $ ] and @xmath324=-c_{{\\upsilon}}u(0)$ ] , the last one coming from an integration of the equation of motion across a thin shell around @xmath182 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the matching conditions are @xmath323=0 $ ] and @xmath324=-c_{{\\upsilon}}u(0)$ ] , the last one coming from an integration of the equation of motion across a thin shell around @xmath182 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this reduces to @xmath325 straightforward algebraic manipulations lead to the following transfer matrix , under the assumption that the second term of the last equation dominates over the the matching procedure is sensitive to the central part only whereas the calculation of the dirac @xmath194-function is sensitive to the whole potential , we therefore expect a factor @xmath332 between the corresponding two amplitudes .attributewe have @xmath333 and hence we recover approximatively the factor @xmath330 mentioned above . the correct amplitude is the one given by the dirac @xmath194-function calculation and is @xmath334 .attributewe now complete the description of the propagation of perturbations through a general relativistic bounce by some considerations regarding the variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 , the spectrum of tensor modes and a comparison with other known transitions in cosmology .attributewe now construct the potentials for the perturbation variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 , the spectrum of tensor modes and the spectrum of tensor modes and a comparison with other known transitions in cosmology .attributewe construct the potentials for both , as in fig .attributean interesting issue , debated at length in the literature  @xcite , is how the variables @xmath96 and @xmath126 behave as they go through the bounce . as a first step towards understanding what is the variable that 126 in the special case of the square root form for the scale factor as in fig . exting[ vu24 ] [ or eq .  ( [ aseries ] ) with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , the corresponding curves being visually undistinguishable ] with @xmath139 . according to eqs . exting( [ eomu ] ) and ( [ eov ] ) , the potentials depend on three possible terms , namely @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath134 , respectively plotted as the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves . extingthe potential for @xmath96 is also shown as the full line . extingthe pole at @xmath181 in either @xmath337 and @xmath338 appears with opposite sign but is otherwise the same , so there is an exact compensation , so that the full potential is everywhere well - behaved . extingthis is clearly not possible for the potential @xmath336 , since there are more poles in @xmath134 than there are in @xmath338 , so no compensation can occur at these points , but also the pole at @xmath181 appear with the same sign ; the potential for the function @xmath126 follows @xmath134 the argument of the square root at the denominator of the previous equation . suburin other words , @xmath126 diverges when @xmath340 as found in fig . subur[ vuvv ] . subursome remarks are in order at that point . suburfirst , an interesting feature is that @xmath340 diverges when @xmath341 at the bounce ( hence is regular ) and that the divergences occur before and after the bounce but not at the bounce itself even though its potential actually diverges at this point . suburthis is because the effective velocity of sound diverges at the bounce . subursecondly , the time at which @xmath126 divergences is @xmath65-dependent as can clearly be seen from eq . exting( [ blowv ] ) . suburthirdly , the physical interpretation of this divergence is subtle . if @xmath126 had the usual interpretation ( _ i.e .  _the variable that is canonically quantized ) , the divergence would clearly be a problem . roughly speaking , this would mean explosive particle creations and , as a consequence that there is a back - reaction problem . suburmore seriously , this divergence would be at odd with the fact that the bardeen potential remains finite and the potential for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath345 . within the framework of our bouncing solution , we first consider the potential for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath345 . within the framework of our bouncing solution , we first consider the potential for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath350 provided by @xmath350 .this is @xmath346 which can be simply analyzed as follows .    as direct calculation reveals , the potential @xmath347 of eq . ( [ vh ] ) has either a single maximum located at @xmath181 if the expansion parameter @xmath348 , or a minimum at @xmath181 and two maxima at the points @xmath349 given by @xmath350 provided @xmath351 . in the latter case , the maximum value attained by the gravitational wave potential is @xmath352 since @xmath353 and @xmath354 , this means that the maximum value for the potential is less than @xmath355 in all cases of physical interest . in other words , and since in these units the cosmologically relevant modes are those having @xmath258 , the potential is dominated at all math360 and @xmath361 because they play a different role in the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 . The potential for @xmath96 in this case is identically vanishing , whereas the potential for @xmath361 in this case is identically vanishing .indeed , the potential for @xmath126 in this case is @xmath362 , which , for a purely radiation dominated universe ( _ i.e .  _ with @xmath363 and @xmath364 ) , is identically vanishing , whereas the potential for @xmath96 is @xmath365''/\\left [ \\left(a\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\right)^{-1}\\right]$ ] , which in the same situation would be @xmath366 . during the transition however ,the presence of an amount of matter , however tiny , leads to a nonvanishing @xmath361 , and hence a nonzero diverging term for small conformal times @xmath367 : the radiation dominated universe represents a singular limiting case .attributethis means that both potentials are large already at small times , deep into the radiation era , and the approximation @xmath368 is accurate both before and after the transition and the variables ( they differ by numerical factors ) as well as the exact solution ( for @xmath371 ) for the bardeen potential ( dashed line ) as a function of conformal time.,width=321 ]    another situation of cosmological interest to compare the bounce with is a phase of quasi - exponential inflation followed by preheating and the subsequent epoch of radiation domination . when only one field is present, the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 are essentially undistinguishable and both coincide numerically with the inverse hubble size @xmath235 , as shown schematically in fig . subur[ infrde ] . for more than one field , the situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential  @xcite . suburfor a given wave number @xmath6 , the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , which is often phrased , because of the similarity with the hubble scale , as `` horizon exit '' ( see ref . exting@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point , and ref . exting@xcite in the bounce context ) . as illustrated in fig . extingthe situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\in this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed spatial section case in order to satisfy the null energy condition.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\in this section , we were able to develop a general formalism by expanding any bouncing scale factor around the @xmath57 de sitter - like bouncing solution .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this expansion is characterized by two parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 which , in some sense , are the counterparts of the slow - roll parameters in the usual inflationary models  @xcite . because this expansion permits a general calculation of the potential for the primordial scalar gravitational perturbations , this allows to fully determine the structure of their evolution as they propagate across the bounce .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the potential @xmath313 obtained is radically different from the hubble scale at the relevant times .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this has to be contrasted with the inflationary paradigm for which @xmath235 and @xmath313 are almost identical . 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . subur[ sketch ] . suburthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 . suburin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref . exting@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref . exting@xcite . extingparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation . extingnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly . extingthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the and unfortunately , one consequence of the failure of any general argument preventing any alteration of the spectrum is that one needs to explicitly model a regime in which higher order string corrections are dominant . avoiding this was the main interest of the general argument in question .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we also obtained that the relevant propagation variable is not @xmath126 , whose flat space equivalent is commonly used for quantization , _ and _ , i.e.  _ for setting up the initial conditions , but rather the intermediate variable @xmath96 , directly related to the bardeen potential .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this is to be compared with what was recently obtained in ref .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\@xcite , based on a completely different theory of gravity , in which neither variable happens to be bounded at the bounce .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this exemplifies the fact that there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in buonanno , c.  cartier , n.  pinto - neto , n.  turok , j .-fuzan and f.  vernizzi for helpful comments .we are especially indebted to f.  finelli for many enlightening discussions .we are especially indebted to f.  finelli for many enlightening discussions .r.  c.  tolman , phys . rev . * 38 * , 1758 ( 1931 ) ;

time dynamic system with finite state space and output space , and a set are independent . for simplicity , we normalize the dose of mutagens to transfer one nucleotide base to another in one step to 1 . in most cases , nucleotide bases mutate independently , therefore there is no chain effect caused by mutagens . to avoid reactions among different mutagens , we require that at most one chemical mutagen and one radiation be applied in each cell cycle . while constructing a generalized model , since the order of applying chemical mutagens and radiation does not affect the results , without loss of generality , we require they be applied in the order shown in figure 4 .  embodiments that is , chemical mutagens are always applied before the duplication process starts , radiation is always applied in the middle of the cell cycle , and the measurements are taken before every replication starts .  embodiments lastly , we assume that the measurements are always correct , and dna replication error , background mutation rate , and other random noise can be eliminated from measurements by considering them as spontaneous mutation .  embodiments denote the targeted dna segment with n nucleotide bases at kth step by a column vector x TextColor k , as shown in figure 5 .  embodiments k , as shown in figure 5 .  embodiments k , as shown in figure 5 . 2)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i .  isEnabled since every base mutates independently , every element of x � k+1  x  Palestin k+1  is exactly the same as x � k+1  , thus p is diagonal . ߧ ( 2)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 3)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 2)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 3)xk+2=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 2)xk+2=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 3)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 3)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . ߧ ( 3)xk+2=pxk+1=p2xkp2=i . , 1,0 } is a field under proper definitions of addition and multiplication .  practition { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } is a field under proper definitions of addition and multiplication .  practition proofdefining the addition table and multiplication table as in tables 1 and 2 , we check if the set { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } satisfies the definition of field .  practition  defining the addition table and multiplication table as in tables 1 and 2  practition , we check if the set { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } satisfies the definition of field .  practition , we check if the set { 1,2 , 2 , 1,0 } satisfies the definition of field .  practition commutativity of addition and multiplicationsatisfied as tables 1 and 2 are symmetric according to the diagonal .  embodiments additive and multiplicative inversesadditive inverses pair : 11 , 22 , 00.multiplicative inverses pair : 11 , 22 , 11 .  embodiments we conclude { 0,1 , 2 , 2 , 1 } is a field under addition and multiplication defined by tables 1 and 2 . from now on ,  embodiments we use  to denote the field { 0,1 , 2 , listed in table 3 . here � , s represents the mutation from four normal nucleotide bases , and w corresponds to mutation from nonsense base , that is , w  0 only if x TextColor k = 0 . rewriting ( 4 ) by collecting all values of s and w in table 3 , we get � , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , w TextColor k , w TextColor k , w TextColor k , w TextColor k , w TextColor k , w TextColor ( 5a)xk+1=(i+j=04ukjsj)xk+j=04ckjwj TextColor ( 5b)=(i+uks)xk+ckw , TextColor where { s TextColor 0 , s TextColor 1 , s TextColor 1 , s TextColor 2 , s TextColor 3 , s TextColor 4 } = { 0,1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 } , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor equation ( 5b ) is a simplified version of ( 5a ) as we put u TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , w. s and w into vector form u TextColor k , s TextColor k , s TextColor k , w. s and w serve as vector basis for base -

yau singularities with d - branes stuck at or near the singularity . by taking a large volume limit , the models of interest are based on calabi - yau singularities with d - branes stuck at or near the singularity . embodimentsit is possible to decouple gravity from the theory , and ignore the calabi - yau geometry far from the branes . embodimentsalthough one typically begins the construction with branes free to move throughout the calabi - yau space , many interesting theories include fractional branes ( or wrapped branes ) , which are d - branes stuck at the singularity and which can not move away from it . embodimentsthese fractional branes can lead to topology changes in the geometry via gaugino condensation branes probing a calabi - yau singularity , supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometry ( susy - bog ) occurs when the singularity admits fewer deformations than the number of ( anomaly free ) independent fractional branes that one can add to the system .    in this paper , we will show how this breaking occurs in one particular example , d - branes probing the singularity of the calabi - yau cone over the first del pezzo surface , @xmath1 . suburthis case can be analyzed using the gauge theory / gravity correspondence . in field theory , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . suburthe deformation obstruction causes the breaking . suburthe susy - bog adds a new feature to the string theory landscape . subur@xmath1 belongs in the chiral ring . extingwe will develop this picture further to make this set of ideas more precise . extingwe will develop this picture further to make this set of ideas more precise . extinga generic property of fractional branes is that they have gaugino condensation on their worldvolume , which translates to non - trivial deformed relations in the chiral ring of the field theory . extingwhen it is possible to deform the equations of the chiral ring consistently , the field theory realizes a supersymmetric vacuum . extingif it is impossible to deform the equations in the chiral ring consistently , then the theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry . extingperhaps the prototypical example of a calabi - yau singularity with fractional branes is the conifold singularity , in the setups of klebanov and witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and its generalization to the warped deformed conifold geometry of klebanov and strassler ( ks ) @xcite . extingthe ks solution is an example of a space with no obstruction to deformation , and in this case chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in the strongly coupled dual gauge theory may be identified with the deformation in a ^2 =  . subur[ coneqdef ] this @xmath9 parameter is interpreted as a gaugino condensate in the dual theory and breaks the r - symmetry to @xmath10 . suburmoreover , cutting off the cone at a radius @xmath9 produces confining behavior of strings in this geometry which are dual to electric flux tubes in the gauge theory . suburnaively , one could imagine that a very similar phenomenon occurs for the cone over @xmath1 , but there is an obstruction . a theorem by altmann @xcite claims that there are no deformations of this cone . extingwhile the conifold has the single defining equation ( [ coneq ] ) , we recall below that the cone over @xmath1 requires twenty algebraic relations in @xmath11 which are not all independent . extingit is impossible to alter all twenty consistently by adding the analog of @xmath9 in ( [ coneqdef ] ) . extingthe conformal analog of the @xmath1 model with no d5-branes was first proposed separately by kehagias @xcite and by morrison and plesser @xcite as an example of a generalized ads / cft correspondence . extingit is 16 sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite . using the explicit metric , we show there are no solutions to the sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite .impressive comparisons of the conformal anomaly coefficients and r - charges between the ads and the cft sides were carried out for @xmath1 in @xcite .    as was the case for the conifold , adding d5-branes to the tip of the cone over @xmath1 breaks conformal invariance and leads to a cascading gauge theory @xcite . recently , a supergravity solution dual to this cascading theory was derived by herzog , ejaz , and klebanov ( hek ) @xcite .the hek solution shares many of the features of the predecessor of the ks solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution @xcite . like the kt solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution is singular in the infrared ( small radius ) ; at large radius , in the ultraviolet , the kt solution approaches the ks solution .the large radius region can be used to calculate geometr strong coupling behavior that is not confinement .    for the f -next , turning on fayet - iliopoulos terms in the field theory , we show that the theory should confine in the infrared .    for the f -last , using the konishi anomaly @xcite , we show there are no solutions to the f - term equations .    for the f -next , turning on fayet - iliopoulos terms in the field theory , we show that the theory should confine in the infrared .    for the f -last , using the konishi anomaly @xcite , we show there are no solutions to the f - term equations .   the field theory analysis is well suited for studying vacua where mesonic operators get expectation values  the mesonic branch  and is less so for the baryonic branch .    for the baryonic branch ,we will show that the mesonic branch of the @xmath1 field theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .    for the baryonic branch ,we have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along the baryonic branch , but the argument is not as rigorous as the k branes will always break supersymmetry . 神we emphasize that the supersymmetry breaking is an infrared effect . 神the warp factor in the geometry will lead to an exponential separation between the ultraviolet and infrared scales , giving a natural way of achieving low - scale supersymmetry breaking should we embed this cone over @xmath1 in a compact calabi - yau . 神an optimistic point of view is that one might be able to build supergravity solutions from compactified versions of this cone over @xmath1 , and using these solutions , produce realistic cosmological models similar to @xcite where all stringy moduli are stabilized and supersymmetry is broken in a controlled way . 神such solutions deserve further study . 神the quiver theory for the first del pezzo has four gauge groups and a number of bifundamental fields conveniently summarized using a quiver diagram ( see fig . 神[ dp1 ] ) .    , also known as an irregular @xmath18 fibration of @xmath19 blown up at a point.,width=288 ]    the superpotential for the first del pezzo takes the form w = _ u_l^v^y_1 -

Converselyhowever , in the case @xmath94 , @xmath47 can not be maximized . Converselyif we let @xmath97 parametrize the family of solutions to the beta function constraints , it is straightforward to see that r^3 = 24 ( -19 m^2 - 27 mn - 9n^2 + ( m+n)(2m+n ) r_v ) is a linear function in @xmath98 . Consequently, one can see the pathology in the @xmath99 case even before computing @xmath47 . Consequently, one can see the pathology in the @xmath97 case even before computing @xmath47 . Converselythe r - charges of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 operators of the previous section do not depend on @x have an infinite number of troublesome operators , and truncating them from the theory will radically change the geometry .    the theory isa simpler and we believe more probable resolution to this pair of problems  an inability to maximize @xmath47 and an infinite set of operators below the unitarity bound  is that the corresponding superconformal fixed point does not exist .    at the beginning of our analysis, we assumed an su(2 ) symmetry . if we allow this su(2 ) to be broken , we can maximize @xmath47 but there will still be an infinite number of operators with negative conformal dimension .    we begin by analyzing the theory with no d3-branes and @xmath7 d5-branes .    the pure d5-brane gauge theory precludes the possibility of a baryonic branch , a possibility we will return to later .    the pure d5-brane gauge theory precludes the possibility of a baryonic branch , a possibility we will return to later .    the pure d5-brane gauge theory precludes the possibility of a baryonic branch , a possibility we will return to later .    the pure d which allow the addition of fayet -

term equations .potion] suppose we add an fi term @xmath113 for the @xmath114 .potionfor the purposes of this argument we take @xmath113 to be large compared to other scales in the problem and temporarily ignore the superpotential . we choose the fi term @xmath117 and set the expectation values of @xmath31 and @xmath108 , @xmath104 equal to zero .turning now to the superpotential , we see that the large expectation values for the @xmath32 give large masses to the @xmath31 and @xmath108 superfields , which we may then integrate out . but we do not know if the @xmath31 and @xmath108 superfields give large masses to the @xmath108 superfields , which we may then integrate out . but we do not know if the @xmath31 and @xmath108 superfields give large masses to the @xmath108 superfields .after integrating out these fields , we see that the @xmath106 group decouples from the other gauge groups , and we know that pure @xmath106 gauge theory with no flavors generically confines and that the gauginos condense .shieldalthough we have carried out the analysis for large @xmath113 , we can now tune @xmath113 away to zero . since confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are low energy phenomena controlled by f -

zero .    the @xmath144 have to be zero .    the @xmath144 have to be zero .    the @xmath144 have to be zero .   the @xmath144 have to be zero .   the anomaly arguments assumed supersymmetry , so we conclude that supersymmetry must be broken ( or that the vacuum of the theory is in some other way ill - defined . )    the inability to satisfy these constraints is reminiscent of the geometric obstruction to deformation discovered by altmann @xcite ( see appendix a for a brief review ) .    the cone over @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of twenty ( dependent ) equations in nine variables .    the cone over @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of twenty ( dependent ) equations in nine variables .   it is possible to deform these equations by a parameter @xmath9 , but one finds that mutual consistency of the deformed equations requires that @xmath146 vanishes . if @xmath9 were not obstructed , we would identify this deformation of the geometry with the superpotential .    taking these quadratic relations for the @xmath144 on their own, we would conclude that two of the @xmath144 are zero .    taking these quadratic relations for the @xmath122 on their own, we would conclude that two of the @xmath144 are zero .    taking these quadratic relations for the @xmath144 on their own, we would conclude that two of the @xmath144 are zero .furthermore , if only one of the gauge groups has a nonzero @xmath144 , we can assume for that particular gauge group @xmath122 .   the only reasonable possibility is @xmath151  but we have already shown that if the @xmath121 group flows to strong coupling first , then supersymmetry should be broken .   all our analysis so far has concerned the pure d5-brane theory , but as argued before , this analysis extends to the case where there are branes in the bulk : what happens at the singularity is independent of the branes in the bulk and supersymmetry is broken on the mesonic branch of the general theory .    however , there are other b old , we have an @xmath155 theory with bifundamentals @xmath156 and @xmath157 , @xmath158 and a quartic superpotential w_tree = _ ij _ kl a_i b_k a_j b_l at strong coupling for the @xmath129 group , we form the mesonic operators @xmath159 , and the superpotential is modified by quantum effects @xcite w_eff = w_tree + x ( m + b -

confusion noise and confusion limit is closely related to the fluctuation field @xmath25 . practition@xcite formulated the confusion limit for a power - law source number counts . practitionhis formulation was then extended for general number counts by @xcite . @xcite practitionhave made some improvement on the source flux .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\even in such a simple case , @xcite showed that the confusion noise can be very severe for sources with low signal - to - noise ratios .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\they pointed out that when the confusion noise dominate the error , the total noise can not be gaussian , and gave a qualitative discussion on the problem .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\they claim to use a monte carlo approach to evaluate in that case .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , we have an expression for the fluctuation field , and we can utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . @xcite and his team also gave a qualitative discussion on the problems of _ confusion _ and _ blending _ : the former generally means that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which can not be detected by the considered instrument individually , and the latter indicates that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which is bright enough to be detected as a source if they were located far from the central brightest source .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the term ` confusion limit ' is related to the former phenomenon , and consequently , confusion limit flux is weaker than the noise flux for bright sources .    how to treat these two effects in a unified manner source is observed with flux @xmath111 ( see the middle panel of figure  [ fig : pd ] ) .attributeon the other hand , if @xmath37 is dominated by a bright source @xmath112 , then the source is observed as an additive noise of the brighter source with flux @xmath112 ( the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pd ] ) .attributehowever , @xcite pointed out that there is a possibility that the signal @xmath37 consists of two or more sources with fluxes fainter than @xmath10 .attributethe probability of such multiple source blending is obtained by the same manner as discussed in  [ sec : fluctuation ] .attributeagain we should consider @xmath113 , under the condition @xmath114 and the probability of having a noise intensity @xmath37 produced by @xmath81 sources is expressed by a convolution [ equation  ( [ eq : dfx_conv ] ) ] . for @xmath37 to be a mere noise , there must not be sources brighter than @xmath10 in a beam .attributehence , we should derive the conditional probability of having @xmath37 caused by @xmath81 sources under the condition @ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for unclustered point sources , and @xmath120       w_{k}\\,d{{\\bm

distribution @xmath25 itself at @xmath110 , and @xmath118 at @xmath121 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this consideration naturally explains the fact that the confusion noise flux is stronger than the confusion limit flux .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\since we have a variety of background in the image data in a real situation , we fit and subtract from the obtained flux , the noise is not necessarily positive .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus in practice , the dependence of the confusion noise distribution on flux @xmath10 causes only a weak variation along @xmath10 under the existence of other kind of noise , because of the convolution with other noise .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we next formulate the relation between the beam size @xmath122 and the source confusion limit for simplicity .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this is not an

Palestinthe source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington . in this line , the formulation is that the sources are distributed homogeneously on the sky .    however , this assumption is not realistic in many applications , e.g. , stars in the galaxy , or galaxies in the universe .    clustering for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions ,based on the general formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . for galaxy clustering ,we considered an infrared facility with an aperture of 70 cm and an ideal airy psf . for galaxy clustering , we considered an infrared facility with an aperture of 70 cm and an ideal airy psf . for galaxy clustering , we adopted the hierarchical _ ansatz _ to calculate higher - order correlation functions used in our formulation . without clustering ,the confusion limits would be 3.1mjy , 23  mjy , and 138  mjy for the indices @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .for the indices @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , y , respectively . embodimentsthese estimates are not much different from the limits calculated without clustering [ 1.8mjy ( @xmath191 m ) , 11.4mjy ( @xmath188 m ) , and 105mjy ( @xmath189 m ) ] . embodimentsthe gradual flattening of the number count slope toward the fainter flux densities , which is observed for infrared galaxies , makes the clustering effect very small , even though the slope is very steep at @xmath192 . as for the pdf at these wavelength bands, the peak probability also decreases up to @xmath2  % , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier . embodimentsthe clustering effect may not seem very severe , because present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics . embodimentshowever , we must keep this effect in mind when we estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data by _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf _ and _ sirtf_.    we will also apply our method to future submillimeter large surveys . embodimentsmost of the submillimeter galaxies are dusty vigorous starbursts , and the dominant constituent of the cosmic submillimeter background radiation . the promotion of science . here is the definition and some formulae for the important statistical quantities , factorial moments and factorial cumulants . here is the definition and some formulae for the important statistical quantities , factorial moments and factorial cumulants . here is the definition and some formulae for the important statistical quantities , factorial moments and factorial cumulants . here is the definition and some formulae for the important statistical quantities , factorial moments , factorial moments , factorial cumulants . here is the definition and some formulae for the important statistical quantities , factorial moments , factorial cumulants , @xmath196 } \\equiv               n(n-1)\\cdots(n-1)\\cdots(n - k+1 ) & k=0,\\cdots , n\\ , , \\\\           0 & k > n\\ , .\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] factorial moments of @xmath16 are defined as @xmath197 } \\equiv { \\mathsf{e}\\left[n^{[k]}\\ aligned}\\ ] ] the first few relations are as follows : @xmath202 } & = & m_{[1 ] } = { \\mathsf{e}\\left[n\\right ] } \\,,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\c_{[2 ] } & = & m_{[2 ] } - m_{[1]}^2 \\,,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\c_{[2 ] } & = & m_{[2 ] } - m_{[1]}^2 \\,,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\c_{[3 ] } & = & m_{[3 ] } - 3m_{[2]}m_{[1]}+2m_{[1]}^3 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a poisson distribution , @xmath203 , @xmath202 } = { \\bar{n } } , \\quad c_{[k ] } = 0 \\quad ( k\\geq2)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these summary statistics are extensively used in the field of structure formation , especially for counts - in - cells analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ? ?

to investigate these statistical effects, it is however desirable to assemble _ large samples _ of wide binary systems . embodimentsmuch can also be learned by assembling and comparing samples drawn from a variety of populations and stellar thatworldwide binaries are also expected to have orbital velocities @xmath24 km s@xmath1 , so their radial velocities should be nearly identical , as well as their proper motion vectors . while radial velocities are efficient at separating out physical and optical pairs at any distance range , parallaxes and proper motions are most useful at small radial

distant wide binaries in deep imaging surveys using statical arguments based on angular separations alone . embodimentsa classical example is the two - point correlation method elaborated by @xcite . embodimentstheir analysis of deep images of north galactic pole demonstrated an excess of pairs with small angular separations , compared to what one would expect from a random distribution of single

embodimentsa classical example is the two - point correlation method elaborated by @xcite . embodimentstheir analysis of deep images of north galactic pole demonstrated an excess of pairs with small angular separations , compared to what one would expect from a random distribution of single stars proper motion population also makes it easier to identify _ intrinsically faint _ companions , such as m dwarfs or brown dwarfs . in particular , it must be emphasized thathigh proper motion stars are also generally within range of accurate parallax measurements , which ultimately provide the most stringent test of the binary star status of the components .    unfortunately , a complete catalog of all the high proper motion stars surveyed for cpm companions was never published by luyten , leaving no data on the parent population . in particular , it must be emphasized that the lds catalog is not a subsample of the _ nltt catalog _ @xcite ; the nltt catalog compiles only the fastest stars identified by luyten ( @xmath28 yr@xmath1 ) and @xmath29 of the lds pairs have proper motions below the nltt limit , leaving no data on the parent population . other limitations of both the lds and nltt catalogs include ( 1 ) a limited precision in the tabulated proper motions @xcite which leaves significant uncertainties on some of the pairings , and ( 2 ) a photographic magnitude system ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) which does not yield reliable photometric distances for red dwar search for wide binaries using the luyten catalogs was made possible with the release of the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) assembled by @xcite . embodimentsthe rnltt is based on the re - identification of nltt stars in the usno - a catalog @xcite and in the 2mass _ second incremental release _ of the nltt catalog @xcite . embodimentsthis fixed some of the main limitations of the nltt by providing significantly more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes . embodimentsadditionally , the new optical - to - infrared colors make it possible to separate out white dwarfs , disk dwarfs , and halo subdwarfs in a reduced proper motion diagram @xcite . a complete analysis of the rnltt yielded an expanded list of 1124 cpm doubles @xcite , including clearly defined samples of wide binaries from both the local disk and local halo populations . embodimentsthese samples suggest that the

 2 , our resulting census of cpm pairs is presented in  3 and 4 , a statistically complete sample of wide binaries is defined and analyzed in  5 , the main results are summarized in the conclusion (  6 ) . embodimentsthe formal identification of a cpm pair as a wide binary thus requires one to weight in the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment by comparing the actual distribution of pairs in the ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space with a model of the distribution expected from chance alignments . embodimentscommon proper motion ( cpm ) doubles are , by definition , resolved pairs of stars which have similar proper motions , both in magnitude and orientation . embodimentsthey typically have angular separations ranging from several arcseconds to several arcminutes . embodimentsthey are assumed to be the resolved components of wide binary systems . embodimentsas such , they are also expected to orbit around their common center of mass and display orbital motion . embodimentscpm doubles are thus not expected to have _ identical _ proper motion vectors , since the orbital motion will result in a small relative proper motion between the components of the pair . in most cases , however , the orbital period will be large enough ( @ stars 1 and 2, we can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can also define @xmath52 as the magnitude of the difference between the proper motion vectors : @xmath53 each pair can thus be represented in a ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space . for large numbers of pairs , one can then statistically determine the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment by comparing the actual distribution of pairs in the ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space with a model of the distribution

suburassuming there are @xmath55 objects in set # 1 and @xmath56 objects in set # 2 , then we have @xmath57 pairings . suburwhat we are interested in is the special case where the primary star is a _ hipparcos _ , and the secondary star is a _ hipparcos _ , and the secondary star is a _ hipparcos _ , and the secondary star is a _ hipparcos _ . suburset # 1 is thus the subset of lspm - north stars with a _ hipparcos _ and a _ hipparcos _counterpart ( 4,839 objects ) , while subset # 2 comprises the entire lspm - north catalog ( 61,976 objects ) . suburit is possible to modify the dataset and simulate a situation where no genuine cpm pairs would be found , only chance alignments . suburlet s redefine the angular separation @xmath50 as : @xmath58_{sim}= ( ( \\alpha_1-[\\alpha_2- are married

alignment simulations ( i.e. with set # 2 translated by an angle @xmath59 ) , and for comparable ranges of @xmath61 . embodimentsthe most striking difference between the data and the simulations are the number of pairs found in the lower left corner of each diagram , corresponding to small angular separations _ and _ small proper motion differences . embodimentsvery few pairs are found in the simulations , but the data shows a large concentration of objects in that range . embodimentsthis concentration of objects in the data can only be interpreted as the signature from a population of common proper motion binaries . embodimentspairs of stars found in that region of the parameter space are thus most likely to be genuine physical doubles . embodimentsthe density of chance alignments , however , progressively increases for larger values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 . embodimentsthere exists a limit beyond which the density of chance alignment pairs exceeds that to @xmath69 . in the lspm - north catalog ,the distribution of high proper motion stars empirically follows n(@xmath61)d@xmath70d@xmath61 , where @xmath71 . from that data, we infer that the number density of chance alignments @xmath72 in @xmath73 phase space must follow : @xmath74 for small values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .    to determine the range within which a data pair is most likely to be a cpm double , we define the variable : @xmath75^{0.5},\\ ] ] which includes a normalization of the proper motions to the lower limit of the lspm - north catalog ( 0.15@xmath42 yr@xmath1 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this new variable is deliberately set up so that the number density of chance alignment pairs increases _ linearly _ with @xmath76 ( hence the square root in eq .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this helps in modelizing the contribution from chance alignments , whose density should increase linearly with @xmath77 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we compare the number density distribution of pairs @xmath78 in the data with the mean distribution of simulated , chance alignment math72 begins to dominate . nominethe bottom panel in figure 2 estimates the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment , as a function of the variable @xmath76 . nominethe bottom panel in figure 2 estimates the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment , as a function of the variable @xmath76 . nominewe find that beyond @xmath82 the probability of a pair to be a chance alignment exceeds 50% . nominewe thus use @xmath82 as the upper limit in our search for cpm doubles . nominewe select as wide binary candidate any pair for which @xmath83 , which is equivalent to selecting pairs which satisfy the condition : @xmath84 where @xmath50 is expressed in seconds of arc , and @xmath52 is in seconds of arc per year . nominethe location of this boundary is illustrated in figure 1 for @xmath85yr@xmath1 ( top ) , @xmath86yr@xmath1 ( middle ) , and @xmath87yr@xmath1 ( bottom ) . nominenote that the boundary is a function of the mean proper motion ( @xmath61 ) of the pair , which means that pairs with large proper motions are selected over a larger range in xmath1 which would be unrealistically large for any system with @xmath90au . embodimentswe also set an upper limit to the range of angular separations : @xmath93 this limits the search to a reasonable range in @xmath50 . beyond this limit , we can only conclude that the primary and secondary are _ hipparcos _ stars . embodimentsthe constraints on @xmath52 from eq.7 become so stringent that the allowed range in @xmath52 falls well below the measurement errors , thus losing all practicality . embodimentsthe search area bounded by eqs.6,7,8 should include the vast majority of genuine wide binaries , with minimal contamination from chance alignment pairs . a small level of contamination is still expected , particularly for pairs selected near the boundaries . embodimentsbased on our simulations of chance alignments , we estimate the contamination in the entire search area to be @xmath94 pairs , or @xmath95 of the total sample . embodimentsusing the selection method discussed above , we searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm binaries in which both the primary and secondary ( and tertiary ) are _ hipparcos _ stars . embodimentswe identified a total of 168 such cpm pairs with angular separations @xmath all except 2 of the pair have the parallax of the primary and secondary within 2.0@xmath97 of the measurement errors . for the 2 pairs with mismatched distances , we can only conclude that they are chance alignments . suburthese pairs are represented in fig.3 a open circles ( bottom panel ) . suburone of the rejected pairs is formed of lspm j0722 + 0849s ( hip 35756 ) and lspm j0722 + 0854 ( hip 35756 ) , and has an angular separation of 302@xmath42 . suburthe primary has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath98mas , while the secondary has @xmath99mas . suburthe two parallax measurements are thus significantly different . suburwe note that the difference in proper motion @xmath52 is also substantial , and it is thus not a surprise that the two should come out as chance alignments . suburthe pair was initially selected by our algorithm is mainly because of the relatively large proper motion of the two stars ( @xmath100 yr@xmath1 ) , which makes this alignment a rare event given the relative scarcity of stars with very large proper motions . suburthis pair was similarly identified as a within only 4 mas yr@xmath1 of each other . suburthis striking alignment of both angular positions and proper motion vectors serves as a good warning about the possibility of having physically unrelated stars come up as apparent cpm doubles . suburwe also examined all pairs rejected in the initial cut , and with angular separations @xmath103 , to see if additional cpm binaries could be recovered based on their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes . suburthis is one way to check that the algorithm does a good job at picking out most of the genuine wide binaries . suburan examination of the parallaxes of the primaries and secondaries in 55 pairs with @xmath104 ( all rejected on the first pass ) reveals the existence of two pairs that are indeed consistent with being cpm doubles . suburmore specifically , the parallaxes of the individual components in each of these pairs are consistent with the two stars being at the same distance . in each of them , the parallaxes of both the primary and secondary are better than 10% accurate , and the difference between the parallax of the primary and secondary was smaller than the quoted measurement error . suburwe have added these two pairs to our list of cpm doubles . in fig.3 between the two components ( @xmath113 ) raises suspicion about their physical association , but the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are a near perfect match , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au . \"it is interesting to note that the 2 genuine doubles found among the 55 pairs that were initially rejected suggest that a few percent of the pairs rejected in our search algorithm are likely to be true doubles . \"this emphasizes the limitations of our statistical method in making a complete identification of wide cpm doubles , especially of those with very large angular separations . \"the

imaging @xcite or radial velocity monitoring @xcite . extingthe remaining 11 `` uncertain '' companions are found lying between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence . extingthe simplest interpretation is that these stars are background red dwarfs in chance alignments with foreground _ hipparcos _ stars . extingthey could also be foreground white dwarfs in chance alignments with background _ hipparcos _ stars . extinganother possibility , however , is that these secondaries are red subdwarfs . extingred subdwarfs are the metal - poor counterparts of the main sequence red dwarfs ; in the members of the galactic halo or thick disk @xcite . in figure 6 embodiments, we plot the projected , transverse velocities v@xmath128 of our cpm doubles , against their angular separation @xmath50 . embodimentsthe top panel shows pairs which have secondaries that consistently fall on the main sequence when placed at the primary s distance ( see fig.5 ) . embodimentsthe bottom panel shows the uncertain pairs , including those for which the secondaries are suspected to be subdwarfs ( using the same symbols as in fig.5 ) . embodimentswe find only one pair with a transverse velocity which clearly associate it with the halo population . embodimentsthis is the pair whose primary is the star hip 35756 ( g 89 - 14 ) a known spectroscopic double @xcite . embodimentsalthough its parallax is fairly uncertain ( @xmath129 ) , g 89 - 14 has long been known to be a metal - poor subdwarf , with log(fe / h)@xmath130 @xcite . embodimentsthe relatively small angular separation to the secondary ( @xmath131 ) further argues in favor of this pair being a physical double ( or rather triple , since the _ hipparcos _ primary is : the proximity of the components argues against simple chance alignments . embodimentseither these stars have large errors in their magnitudes , or they are most likely to be subdwarfs . embodimentsthe subdwarf status of the alleged cpm companions should be checked more directly through spectroscopic measurements . embodimentsmetallicity effects can be diagnosed in optical spectra from the ratio of the tio and cah bandstrengths @xcite . embodimentsif both the primary and secondary have spectra consistent with a low metallicity object ( i.e. if they are both spectroscopic subdwarfs ) then they are most likely to be actual physical doubles . embodimentsif on the other hand , the stars are both found to be regular dwarfs , then the pair must be a chance alignment . if one component is found to be a dwarf and the other a subdwarf , then it would also strongly suggest that the pair is a chance alignment , since one would expect cpm doubles to have similar chemical compositions . embodimentsgiven the angular separation limits of our search algorithm , we do expect to be overlooking genuine wide binaries with very large angular separations . embodimentsthe range of our search actually depends on the proper motion of the pair . embodimentsfor instance are due to systematic errors , which affect both stars in a cpm pair equally , and these systematic errors subtract out in @xmath52 . in any case, we conservatively adopt 11.3 mas @xmath1 as the mean error in @xmath52 , and place a 3-@xmath97 limit at @xmath138 mas yr@xmath1 . in any case,since this is larger than our adopted detection limits at large separations

frequencies are dominant . due to the bloch - siegert shift , which is the exact resonance condition . subursee ( [ bss ] ) , in both cases @xmath291 is not the exact resonance condition . suburhowever , in the nonlinear case the nonlinearity partly compensates the bloch - siegert shift , which also influences the relative peak heights , as we argued in section [ hamiltonian ] .      to investigate the influence of temperature we show in figure [ ffig2 ] @xmath292 and the corresponding @xmath290 for the same parameters as in figure [ ffig1 ] , but at inverse temperature : @xmath293 . by increasing the temperature higher oscillator levels , which are populated and influence the dynamics of the qubit . suburwe calculated the corresponding equations for the long time dynamics within the sea . suburthe relaxation matrix @ the reasons for this arise due to the finite populations of the involved levels . suburtherefore the appearance of additional shoulders in the dynamics is a pure temperature effect , which is also seen in the corresponding linear case . suburthe frequency shift induced by the nonlinearity is much larger for the higher levels . suburthe effect of temperature is also reflected in the height of the dominating peaks , which is decreased for higher temperatures . the temperature can not influence which peak is dominant . suburthis means by comparing figure [ ffig1 ] with figure [ ffig2 ] that in both figures in the nonlinear case the peak corresponding to @xmath158 dominates over the one corresponding @xmath159 . suburthe use of a nonlinear oscillator instead of a linear one has advantages which rely in the fact that the energy spectrum of the nonlinear oscillator is not equidistant . supposing that the tls frequency @xmath301 can be tuned , it is in case of the nonlinear oscillator possible to have the tls in resonance with exactly one and only one nonlinear oscillator state transition . suburthereforeall other transitions are then off resonance / detuned . suburfor the linear oscillator in resonance with the tls the number of possible transitions is in principle transitions is not seen .the reason for this is the small population of the higher oscillator levels involved .the reason for this is the small population of the higher oscillator levels involved .the reason for this is the small population of the higher oscillator levels involved .to conclude , we determined the dynamics of a tls which is coupled via a nonlinear oscillator to an environment described by an ohmic spectral density . suburwe restricted ourselves to the regime of weak nonlinearity , weak damping and moderate coupling of oscillator and tls . to diagonalize the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator hamiltonian we used van vleck perturbation theory , hence avoiding the use of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . within the rwa and for vanishing nonlinearity , we used the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .our model would reduce to the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian . in section [ hamiltonian ] , an analytical expression for the non - dissipative dynamics of the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator systemis given , which accounts for the infinite hilbert space of the composed system .the influence of the nonlinearity onto the qubit dynamics is determined and compared to the cing almost perfectly the exact numerical solution .correctiona

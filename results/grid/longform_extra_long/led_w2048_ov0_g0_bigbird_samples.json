degree galaxy redshift survey ( 2degs we show that a brief period of thermal inflation can give rise to dark radiation with anisotropic stress .<n> this is caused by a scalar field @xmath0 which undergoes a phase transition and subsequently decays into visible and dark radiation . after the phase transition ,<n> the coherent oscillation of the scalar field survives and gives rise to non - relativistic matter which dominates the universe . in this scenario , dark radiation can be directly observed if we look at the cmb anisotropy spectrum . <n> the origin of the anisomorphism between the gravitational ( gw ) and electromagnetic ( em ) sectors is still a matter of debate @xcite . here<n> , we consider a scenario in which a short period of inflation , which is triggered by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a higgs field , is followed by a thermal phase transition ( tpt ) , after which the gw modes instantaneously decay into the visible radiation and the em modes instantaneously decouple from the thermal bath . as a result , there is an anisootropic stress in the electromagnetic sector , as in the case of the gravitational and electroweak sectors , where the em sector is described by the einstein -

based interferometers , such as lisa @xcite , cmb anisotropies and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ,<n> it has been a great challenge to understand the origin of gws in the sm and in other extensions of the sm . at the same time<n> , the discovery of the cosmological dark matter ( dm ) by the wilkinson microwave anisotropic probe ( wmap ) experiment has motivated a great deal of theoretical work on the dm sector , in particular , on the so - called susy models , which have been proposed to explain the origin we derive the spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) with a brief period of thermal inflation .<n> we find that the spectrum is almost flat except for the modes with wavenumbers @xmath0 entering the horizon at the end of the thermal inflation era , which are characterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio of about two , and the amplitude of gw in the md era is of the order of a few percent of that in the rd era . <n> the inflationary universe is characterized by an initial period of accelerated expansion , followed by a period of contraction . during this period ,<n> the universe undergoes various phases , including a phase transition at a critical point @xcite . in particular , the equation of state of the hot big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) phase is dominated by a component with zero gravitational constant , called the higgs field , whose mass is proportional to the hubble parameter . at the same time , some other types of matter , such as the cosmological constant ( cmb ) and the dark energy , are also responsible for the expansion of the universe . as a result , gravitation perturbations , i.e we consider gravitational waves ( gws ) which are well - inside around the vacuum - energy domination and well - outside the horizon at the phase transition between thermal inflation and thermal inflation .<n> we find that the gw spectrum is oscillatory in the intermediate frequency region , and the amplitude of the oscillatory feature is proportional to the ratio of matter energy density to the vacuum energy at the transition . in the case where the equation of state changes as @xmath0 as in thermal inflation<n> , we also find that in the short - wavelength limit , the spectrum is given by the formula @xcite . <n> although the global picture of gw spectral shape is well known , actually there appear additional  horizon exit '' and _ horizon entry '' processes _ in gw spectra compared with other modes . here<n> we show that such additional processes are caused by the  oscillation '' of the wavenumber of the mode entering the horizon . as a result ,<n> the spectrum in the medium region becomes smaller and the oscillation becomes stronger with increasing wavenumber , but in the high - frequency region the spectrum becomes larger and more oscillatory , which is not seen in the low - wavelength region . we study the effect of dark matter annihilation into dark energy halos in the framework of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) model . in this model ,<n> the annihilation takes place at the reheating temperature @xmath0 , which is much lower than the critical temperature for reheating of the universe .<n> we show that the effect can be as large as several orders of magnitude larger than the effect due to the annihilation into cold dark matter ( cdm ) . <n> recently , the observation of high - redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite and the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @x<n> , together with the estimates of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements by the boomerang and the x - ray telescope experiments , have become the most important probes of the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . for the first time , these observations have revealed the existence of dark energy ( de ) which is the main component of the energy budget of our universe ( e.g. , see refs.@xcite for the latest on - line reviews ) and we study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on the primordial density perturbations .<n> in particular , we focus on the effects of the lightest supersymmetric particle , @xmath0 , and its superpartners , the neutralino and the chargino . we find that the primordial perturbations are significantly affected by the presence of the supersymmetric partners . as a result ,<n> the primordial power - law index of the density fluctuations is modified , which can be tested in the near future . <n> one of the most important problems in particle physics today is to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken at the weak scale , i.e. at the electroweak scale . at this scale<n> the mass of the susy particles is of the order of tev , while at the planck scale they should be lighter than the top quark and antiquark , in order to be consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) and the lepton flavor violation ( lfv )",

matter transition . in the framework of our bouncing solution ,<n> the evolution of the scalar and tensor modes of the perturbations can be calculated exactly , as well as the spectrum of the gravitational waves , provided the expansion parameter @xmath0 is less than a critical value , which depends on the parameters of the model . <n> the standard cosmological model ( sm ) predicts the existence of two phases of the history of the universe , a radiation phase and a matter phase , separated by an inflationary period of period @xcite . during the inflationary period the universe underwent a series of cosmological transitions : first , it was decelerating , then expanding , until it entered the radiation era , at which point it underwent a second transition , this time to matter domination . at that time<n> the universe entered a new phase of accelerated expansion we comment on the recent proposal by veneziano , durrer and laukenmann , and others , of a new scenario for the early universe , in which gravity is driven by a single parameter , the cosmological constant , @xmath0 . in this scenario ,<n> the universe undergoes a phase of accelerated expansion , which is followed by a period of contraction .<n> the spectrum of gravitational wave is not affected by this transition . <n> [ [ section ] ] in a recent paper @xcite , it has been proposed that a new theory of gravitation , based on the higgs mechanism , may explain the accelerated expansion of the universe observed today , as well as the large scale structure ( lss ) and the structure of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , without the need for any fine - tuning of the parameters of the theory . among other things , this proposal invokes the existence of a single , universal constant ; the cosmological  constant ' , whose value is determined by the value of the cosmological term in the lagrangian . at present<n> , there are several different ways to define",

optic methods , noninvasive , chemical , optical , optoelectronic . in this paper , we present a method for the design and testing of rat exposure monitoring systems .<n> the method is based on the analysis of the rats exposed to different concentrations of chemical agents , such as rotenone , kcn , pcp , and lung matter . <n> exposure monitoring is a fundamental aspect of animal health sciences , with applications in epidemiology , neuroscience , environmental health , as well as homeland security and many other fields . in this study ,<n> we demonstrate that the design of a monitoring system can be used to determine the statistical significance of the exposure of an animal to different chemical environments . to this end<n> , the method was applied to three systems : two rats that were exposed to rotenone and kcn and one rat that was exposed to lung matter ( either normoxic or hyperoxic ) . for the first system , both nadh and fad<n> surface signals to lung perfusion were observed after exposure of up to 60 hours , but nadh was observed to be significantly reduced by the addition of kcn to the perfusate reservoir , whereas fad showed no change in nadh . as a result , <n> the system was found to be * purpose : * in order to understand the effect of metabolic inhibitors ( pcp , pcp + kcn ) and kcn ( rotenone , rotenone + kccn ) on lung surface fad and nadh fluorescence signals , as well as their dependence on lung perfusion , we developed a computational model . <n> * methods :* we developed an iterative algorithm for the calculation of the intensity of the fad / nadh and fad / pcp fluorescence .<n> the algorithm is based on numerical integration of stochastic differential equations , and is designed to be fast and accurate , thus enabling the study of a large number of patients . to test our model ,<n> we performed simulations of lung perfusion in the presence of various metabolic inhibitors , including pcp and rotenone with different concentrations of kcn or kcn@xmath0 . in the simulations , <n> we investigated the effects of varying the concentrations of these agents on fad and pcp signals and on nadh signal , respectively , by varying the perfusion rate with either pcp or rotenone and the concentration of the other chemical . for comparison , the same calculations<n> were performed in the absence of any chemical agents . hyperoxic exposure is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in rodent populations .<n> however , it is still poorly understood . in this study , we investigated the effect of hyperoxia - induced changes in mitochondrial redox state on the complex i and ii activities of lung homogenates in rats , and compared the results to those obtained for normoxic and hypermoxic lungs . <n> _ keywords : _ lung , mitochondria , redox state , hyperoxics , t - test . in this paper , we study the effect of exposure to 100% hyperoxia on the activities of the krebs cycle enzymes , succinate dehydrogenase , isocitrate dehydrogenase and complex i redox state in lung tissue .<n> we demonstrate that the measured change in cytosolic nadh signal in the presence of 100% hyperoxic substrate does not alter significantly the coupling between respiration and phosphorylation in lung as compared to that in normoxic lung . however , the increase in complex i reddening observed in lung under the same exposure conditions could contribute to the observed decrease in nadh activity . <n> recently , there has been an increasing interest in studying the effects of extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) radiation ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) on eukaryotic cells @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that xuv radiation can reduce the activity of some transcription factor - sensitive enzymes such as erythrocytes , leading to an increase in the rate at which they are synthesized and an overall reduction in the number of genes involved in their transcription cascades . as such ,<n> xuv irradiation can be used as a tool to measure the level of an enzyme s activity  there is ample evidence that increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) is a major pathophysiological factor in the genesis of hyperoxic lung injury .<n> however , it is not clear how ros sources in lung tissue affect the rate of ros formation . in this study<n> , we investigated the effects of varying the activity of hyperoxia on the complex i of mitochondria , which is known to be a major ros source , and on the fad ( fad - complex i ) signal in lung injury in rat models . compared to normoxic lung treatment ,<n> the measured decrease in fad signal following the addition of kcn to pcp - treated lungs was 56% . on the other hand , the measured reduction in complex i activity could represent an adaptive mechanism by the cells , , in the reduction of the rate at which ros is produced . <n> mitochondria electron transport complex i ( ) has been shown to play an important role in the generation of , oxidative stress and in the regulation of a number of cellular processes , such as the formation of mitochondria from adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , @xmath0-binding to mitochondria ( tb ) we report a hyperoxia - induced decrease in redox - sensitive flavoprotein ( fad ) signal in rat lung tissue from normoxic to hyperoxic conditions .<n> the measured decrease in fad signal is attributed to a decrease in the complex ii redox state . since electrons channeled through<n> complex ii produce 4-fold more mitochondrial superoxide than electrons channelled through complex i , the apparent decrease in complex ii activity could be a means by the cells to reduce ros formation . <n> lung tissue is cytoplasm - rich in mitochondria , and as a result both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments are more reduced in hyperoxiic lungs thannormoxic lungs . in this study , we measured the change in lung surface nadh signal in the presence of documentclass[12pt]minimal  usepackageamsmath$end document  as a measure of complex i and ii activity . the measured change in nadh signals in the present study represents a relatively early in situ metabolic consequence of hyperoxial in that it precedes effects on lung histology , hemodynamic and functional endpoints observed with rat exposure to  documentclass[1pt ] .$ (  in this paper , we demonstrate that measurements of lung surface fluorescence are sensitive to the redox state of specific lung cells , and that this information can be used to evaluate the efficacy of novel or existing interventions on lung redox state and energy homeostasis in patients with ali requiring high oxygen therapy or to monitor the progression of ali and its most severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit . <n> the results of this paper suggest that hyperoxia -

      "generated": "by making extensive use of the methods of the theory of point processes , we present the general analytic formula for the source confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions .<n> we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then present the new formula for inhomogeneous and clustered source distributions . based on the new formulae ,<n> we reconsider how to treat the confusion problem , especially when the error is dominated by the confusion noise . as an application of our formula , in the case of clustered sources we formulate the higher - order clustering of galaxies , which will be included in the general confusion problems . we show that the standard @xmath0-error estimate for the confusion is not reliable , because it does not take into account the effect of the clustering . in particular , when the source distribution is a power - law , the standard error estimate is no longer valid . on the other hand , if the distribution is exponential , it is still a good approximation to estimate the confusion , but the error estimate may become even worse than the standard one if the source density is not an exponential function of the angular size of the sources . <n> we present a general expression for the rule - of we study the statistics of point sources in a fluctuating field .<n> we show that the fluctuation field @xmath0 can be expressed as a laplace functional with respect to a random measure defined on the celestial sphere , and that the cumulants of the random measure are expressed in terms of the laplace cumulants . <n> point sources are astronomical objects that are observed in a wide range of astronomical observatory wavelengths , from the visible to the x - ray . in the infrared , they are often referred to as astronomical infrared ( ir ) sources , since they are brighter than their ir counterparts . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an ir source is the sum of the fluxes of all the point sources present in the field , divided by the flux of the brightest source in the ir field ( the source power ) . for a point<n> source , this sum is a power - law , with an exponential cutoff at the tip of the source ( the  source power '' ) @xcite . as a consequence ,<n> the spectral properties of a point source depend strongly on its ir spectrum , including its spectral index , temperature , flux , we present a new method to determine the spatial distribution of point sources from time - resolved spectroscopy .<n> the method is based on the concept of the probability generating functional of a point field , which allows us to express the observed fluctuation field as an explicit functional of the true point field and to derive the correlation function of the fluctuation field . as an example<n> , we apply our method to the data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) . <n> time - resolving spectroscopy ( trs ) @xcite is one of the most powerful tools for the study of the large - scale structure of the universe , as it is capable of resolving structures as large as @xmath0 of the stellar mass of the milky way ( msw ) down to the scale of a few arcminutes @x<n> . however , this technique is not sufficient for the detailed analysis of the structure of galaxies , especially in the cosmological scale , where the scales of galaxies range from tens of kiloparsecs down to tens of mpc . in order to study galaxies at cosmological scales ,<n> it is essential to have a multi - object spectrometer , we study the effect of clustering on the fluctuation analysis of the sky field . we derive the formula for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the intensity fluctuation including the clustering effect .<n> we apply the formula to the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) data , and find that the pdfs of the flux and the number of the clustered sources are significantly different from those of the unclustered sources . as a consequence ,<n> the rs data can be divided into two classes : ( 1 ) the point - like , clustered sources , whose number density is @xmath0 times larger than that of the background , but whose flux density is much smaller than the background density ; and ( 2 ) those sources with a power - law number density , @xcite . in the former case<n> , we can recover the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( k - am ) index , which is known to be a good measure of the galaxy power spectrum . on the other hand , in the latter case , the k -am index is no longer a good indicator of galaxy power . <n> the we present a method to derive the confusion limit flux from the beam shape .<n> the method is based on the relation between the beam size , @xmath0 , and the variance of the beam . for clustered sources ,<n> we derive the formula for the variance as a function of beam size by using the power - law exponent of differential number counts . as a result<n> , we find that the beam - size dependence of the variance is proportional to the square root of the number count exponent , which is consistent with the result of @xcite . <n> we also present a simple formula for calculating the confusion limits for unclustered sources . with this formula , it is straightforward to calculate confusion limits from any source with flux fainter than the noise flux . in the past few years , there has been a growing interest in the use of beam - based interferometers for high - precision cosmological measurements . among them , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are the most promising , because of their excellent angular resolution and their high sensitivity to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . to measure the cmb anisotropy @x we study the source confusion limits of infrared and submillimeter galaxy surveys , taking into account the clustering of infrared galaxies properly .<n> we find that the number counts and the angular two - point correlation functions can be decomposed into a product of a number of two - dimensional functions , which we denote by @xmath0 , the relative confusion limit of the infrared galaxy distribution . as an example<n> , we consider the iras 1.2 jy survey , and obtain the confusion limits for the number and angular correlation functions . <n> [ firstpage ] galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies ; clusters : general infrared : galaxies cosmology : miscellaneous methods : analytical we present the confusion limits of _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies ( _ s@xmath0 _ @xmath1 m ) , based on the _ herschel _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( hermes ) data .<n> we find that the number counts of infrared galaxies can not be described by a power - law function , and that the slope of the model is steeper than the observed one , i.e. , the index of the integrated number counts is 2.5 , which is 2.5 times larger than that of the differential number counts . we show that the effect of clustering strongly depends on the detected flux : brighter sources have stronger clustering on the sky , while the clustering gradually becomes weaker toward fainter flux . as a result ,<n> the confusion - limit flux becomes 3.8 mjy for unclustered sources and 2.0 mjy with clustered sources , respectively , when the flux is 50 mjy . in order to evaluate the clustering effect , we calculate the correlation functions of the infrared galaxies based on an empirical model of sdss : the galaxies are represented by a gaussian random field with a scale length @x we derived analytic formulae for the submillimeter source confusion with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions .<n> these formulae can be used to evaluate the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure . based on the formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . when @xmath0 approaches to 2.0 , the clustering effect becomes very severe for a power - laws number counts , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier . we also calculated the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity . if we take into account the effect of clustering properly , they become 3.8 mjy , 23 mjy and 9.9 mjy for the indices , @xcite , 2.0 and 2.5 , respectively . the measured confusion limit from scuba survey data was found to be shallower than that expected from classical formula ( d. h. hughes 2003 , private communication ) , hence we should take care of the effect in future submillimeter large surveys . <n> the submm source confusion is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington we derive the first- and second - order cumulants for the fluctuation field of clustered sources .<n> we show that these summary statistics are useful for counts - in - cells analysis . <n> pacs numbers : : 05.40.-a , 05.70.fh , 87.23.ge in statistical mechanics , the cumulants of a stochastic process are the sum of many independent cumulants , each with its own @xmath0 probability distribution . in the case of stochastic processes ,<n> the probability distribution of the total number of cumulants is a gaussian , with a width @xcite . here<n> we consider the case where the stochastic process is a clustered fluctuation field , and derive the cumulant of the first order , which is the average of all cumulants in the field . as a result<n> , we obtain the summary statistics of the fluctuations , i.e. the first and second order cumulant , as a function of the number of clustered variables . for a given number of variables , <n> we denote the average cumulant as  b(bm x)$ ] , where b_k in this paper , we present a method to determine the number of sources per beam in the case of airy beam .<n> this method is based on the assumption that the beam pattern of an optical instrument can be described by an airy function . using this method ,<n> we calculate the confusion limit of sources in the beam of an x - ray ccd interferometer as a function of the beam size , the effective beam area , and the exponent of the power - law angular correlation function of galaxies . we find that the number @xmath0 of sources is strongly dependent on these parameters : the more effective beam size and the steeper the slope of the angular correlations function , more severe is the confusion . for a beam of size<n> i@xmath1 cm , which corresponds to the beam area of a typical ccd in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a confusion limit @x , i.e. , number of times that a source can be detected in one period of the interferometric data , is expected to be around 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 70 , 80 , 100 , or we report the results of a search for point - like and extended sources in a @xmath0 beam from the lsnd survey .<n> we used a matched - filter technique to search for sources in the beam with a flux density above a certain limit determined by the beam size , the number of events per beam , and the standard deviation of the flux density of the sources . in this search<n> we found no extended sources and we set an upper limit on the number density of sources above the limit of a few tens of sources per beam at the 95% confidence level . <n> the results are compared with a classical point - source search and a classical source search with a detection limit set by the detection limit of the source with a label . the results from our search for extended sources are consistent with those from a classical search , but with a much lower detection limit and a significantly lower number of detected sources , indicating that the extended sources detected in our search are more likely to be classical than the classical ones . +<n> * keywords : * lsd survey , extended source , non -

north catalog for cpm multiples with separations @xmath0 au , and identified a total of 347 such systems , of which 158 are doubles and 5 are triples .<n> we find that of the 158 doubles , only 80 of the pairs had been previously reported in gc04 . using again the ls pm - north catalogs for c pm multiples consisting of one _hipparcos<n> _ star with one or more non - _ hipsparcos_-based companions , we searched the catalog of nearby field stars and found an additional 55 pairs that were likely to be true cpm pairs . we have added these two pairs to our list of cpm doubles . <n> we have been conducting a search for wide cpm binaries since the publication of our first paper @xcite . in that paper<n> we described a statistical method for finding pairs with large angular separations , which we used to select the most probable cpm binary systems . here<n> we present the results of our search , including a list of all the systems found , as well as the distribution in angular separation and absolute magnitude of the components we present a search for wide binary secondaries in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .<n> we find 20 pairs with companions lying between the main sequence and the white dwarf cooling sequence , with an angular separation @xmath0 mas yr@xmath1 . of these secondaries ,<n> nine are likely to be foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with background stars , and the remaining 11 are likely subdwarfs , which are the metal - poor counterparts of the standard main sequence stars . in the color - magnitude diagram<n> , we find that the red dwarf and white dwarf sequences are well separated for the secondaries with a dispersion of 0.11 mag , while for the close pairs , the dispersion is 0.95 mag . <n> the discovery of white dwarfs as low - mass companions to main - sequence stars @xcite has triggered a flurry of activity in the study of wide binary systems , both in the field and in the context of extragalactic astrophysics . to date , surveys such as pan - starrs , gaia , sdss and tng have detected more than 100 binaries with separations between 0.1 and 10 mas , or angular separation we report the results of a search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars using the digitized sky survey scans of the large synoptic survey telescope north .<n> we find a total of 130 new wide binary systems , bringing the total number of known pairs of stars with companion johnson - cousins @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to 431 . <n> the large number of previously known wide binaries is a natural result of the digitization of the sky survey , which allows us to search much deeper into the sky than is possible with the survey scans themselves , and to identify a much larger range of projected angular separations . as a result ,<n> we are able to detect a much wider range of secondaries than was previously possible , down to projected separations as small as 15 pc @xcite . in this letter , we report on a search of the northern sky for new wide binaries using the dss telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , as well as 2mass and the large sky survey ( lspm - north ) scans of poss i and poss - ii . here<n> we present a list of the 431 previously known pairs , we report the results of a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions to _ hipparcos _ stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .<n> we find that the northern - sky census of wide binaries is statistically complete for systems with projected separations between the components less than 100 au , and for cpm companions with luminosities @xcite . for wide binaries with separations<n> less than 50 au and absolute magnitudes @x , we find a paucity in the secondaries compared with the field population , suggesting that the formation mechanisms for wide binary systems are biased against secondaries of very low mass , or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries . on the other hand , if we assume that wide binaries are formed initially with both components drawn from the same mass function , then the ratio between the observed and predicted (  current '' ) luminosity function shows a trend that suggests that the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time . since the absolute magnitude of main sequence stars is correlated with mass<n> , this suggests that star formation processes we present a large , statistically complete census of common proper motion ( cpm ) companions to _ hipparcos _ stars in the magnitude range @xmath0 .<n> the completeness of the lspm - north allows us to conduct the most thorough search to date for cpm companions down to a distance of 100 pc , and we find a large population of wide binaries with orbital separations up to 200 au . <n> the distribution of separations is consistent with _ pik s law _ with a slope of 0.17@xmath10.05 and a distribution of projected separations that decreases with increasing separation , with a power law index of @xcite . at large separations ,<n> the secondaries are dominated by fainter , lower - mass companions of similar masses and luminosities , while at smaller separations the distribution is dominated by the fainter k - m dwarfs . in the near future<n> , we plan to extend the census to smaller proper motion regimes by using ccd imaging and adaptive optics systems . we present optical images of the galactic centre ( gc ) from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) of subdwarfs j0316 + 5810 , j0450 + 6319n , and j1507 + 4358n .<n> most of the objects show a central compact object , but there are also a few objects with extended emission or absorption features . <n> the discovery of the first compact objects at very high redshifts @xmath0 has triggered a lot of interest in understanding the formation and properties of such objects . in particular , it has been suggested that these objects are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which are very similar to type ia supernovae ( sne ) except that they have very large luminosities and are thought to have central black holes ( bhs ) @xcite . to test this hypothesis<n> , we have observed a sample of compact objects with jupiter - mass bhs at high galactic latitudes . for most objects ,<n> we find that the central object is offset from the line of sight . however , there are a few recent observations of very compact extragalactic binaries ( vlbs ) show that the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) of their central black holes ( bhs ) increases with increasing mass accretion rate .<n> however , there is no sign of any runaway behaviour of the bh masses , which is expected if the black hole mass is set to the eddington limit . in this letter<n> , we point out that there is a sign of runaway behaviour in the bh mass function , i.e. , the mass at which the ratio of the central bh mass to the mass of the host galaxy reaches a maximum , decreases with increasing bh mass , reaches a minimum , and then increases again . <n> we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of the runaway growth of the mass density in the central black hole ( bh ) due to its relativistic expansion , as recently observed in very compact binaries . for binaries with a central bh of a few tens of solar masses ( ssm ) ,<n> the maximum mass density reached by the binary system at its centre scales with its orbital period , increasing with the binary mass scale , @",

backs of these flows are @xcite : they are given by the restriction of the flow to the union of a finite number of copies of a compact set , called a _ loop _ , and a boundary , respectively . in the case<n> in which the loop is restricted to the set of copies and the boundary is the boundary of the loop , then the restriction must be nonnegative and the loop must satisfy the douglas - type condition . for a loop<n> whose boundary is not contained in the loop and whose length is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the other loops , the restriction is said to be _ nonnegative _ if for any two of the loops in the restriction , any two points on the boundary intersect in their interior . we derive a variation formula for the riemannian manifold @xmath0 with boundary . as an application<n> , we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the area of the boundary , the volume of the surface , and the hausdorff dimension of the manifold .<n> we also show that the area and the volume are in one to one correspondence with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian . <n> the boundary value problem for the schrdinger equation is the following : given a non - smooth , compact , non - hermitian , manifold , choose a boundary condition that is the product of two boundary conditions , one of which is a constant . the other is a positive number , such that for each boundary condition , there is an open subset of the set of boundary conditions that is , up to a rescaling , uniquely determined by the boundary condition itself . in this paper<n> we are interested in the following problem : for a given boundary value , what is the boundary volume that corresponds to a given volume condition ?<n> this is a well - known open problem that has been studied for a long time  we show that the geodesic curvature of a compact riemannian manifold is a priori bounded from below by @xmath0 for almost every compactly supported continuous vector function .<n> we also show that this bound is sharp . <n> [ theorem]acknowledgement [ theorem ]algorithm [ theorem)axiom [ 1]claim [ 1 ] [ 2]conclusion [ 2 ]condition [ 3]conjecture [ 4 ] in this paper we prove a theorem on the existence of time - dependent minimizers of ricci flows on @xmath0-manifolds .<n> the main idea is to show that for a given ricci flow there is an almost sure solution to the plateau problem , i.e. to find the boundary value of the time dependent quantity that minimizes the time - derivative of the area of the minimal disk . as an application<n> , we show that there is a unique minimizer for the geodesic curvature of the boundary of a minimal disk whose area is less than or equal to the minimal area of its geodesic curvature . <n> the existence theorem of hamilton @xcite states that for any smooth , self - similar and integrable flow on a manifold @x , one can find a minimizer of the hamiltonian on the set of all flows that converge to it as time tends to infinity . in this theorem ,<n> hamilton s method was restricted to flows on euclidean spaces , whereas in the present paper we will study flows on closed , toroidal orbifolds ( see definition [ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] below ) . for a closed @x we show that the ricci flow on @xmath0 can be approximated by the solution of a linear system of first order first order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .<n> more precisely , we consider the case in which the first order odes are smooth , compact , and satisfy the douglas - type boundary conditions . in this case , the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem for the odes can be computed explicitly . as an application of this result ,<n> we show how to approximate the solutions of the linear equations by smooth solutions of a second order ode . <n> the aim of this paper is to show that it is possible to approximate a smooth solution of the second order equations by a second - order ode with the same boundary conditions as those for the first - order equations . to do this , first we need to know the boundary conditions for the boundary values problem for some linear system , which we call the _ first order eigenvalue problem_. in the standard setting , this is the problem of finding the boundary of a subinterval of a finite interval , such that the boundary is given by the product of two eigenfunctions of the unit normal vector in this note we give a precise description of the time - evolution of a surgery - type singularity in the three - dimensional euclidean space .<n> in particular , we show that the singularity can be described by a piecewise smooth map . <n> the study of singularity - free evolutions of dynamical systems has a long history , going back to the work of riemann @xcite and smoluchowski @xmath0 in the early 1960s . in his pioneering work ,<n> shannon introduced the notion of a _ singularity _ , i.e. a smooth map that evolves in a non - trivial way up to a time - scale that depends on the value of the parameter that controls the evolution , and called this notion of _<n> singularity_. in recent years , this notion has been generalized in several ways , including the introduction of a notion of an _ evolution parameter _ and the definition of a new class of solutions of the _ schrdinger equation _ describing the evolution of the singularity under a surgery . the most prominent of these is the so - called _ einstein - podolsky - rosen _ ( epr ) equation @",

+ ++ + + /-<n> introduction. + +<n> - + / -<n> * nonlinearity has been shown to play a crucial role in decohering and dissipating systems @xcite , for instance in the quantum control of superconducting qubits , superfluids , and trapped ions . as a result of the interplay between nonlinearity , dissipation , we study the dynamics of a two - level system ( tls - no ) coupled to a dissipative bath .<n> the system is initially prepared in a nonlinear oscillator state , which is then subjected to a sudden change in the oscillator state by a qubit . in order to describe the qubit change we use the bloch - redfield formalism , and we derive a born - markov master equation for the effective oscillator states . we show that the nonlinearity strongly affects the dynamics , as a result of which : ( i ) the oscillation frequency @xmath0 of the oscillator decreases , ( ii ) a change of the number of quanta emitted by the oscillator is accompanied by a decrease of the effective nonlinearity , i.e. , a decrease in the effective redfield tensors . <n> _ introduction._quantum entanglement is a valuable resource for quantum information processing and communication @xcite . among the various forms of entanglement ,<n> one of the most promising and widely used is quantum teleportation , where a quantum state is teleported to a remote location with the help of a classical communication channel . however , teleportation suffers from the problem of we investigate the effect of dephasing on the qubit dynamics in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) three - level system ( tlss ) .<n> the system consists of two qubits in a double - well potential , one of which is coupled to a nonlinear oscillator . in the low temperature limit<n> we find that the qubits oscillate coherently , while the nonlinear oscillator oscillates with two frequencies . at high temperatures , however , the system behaves incoherently . <n> [ [ section ] ] the problem of decoherence in quantum systems is of fundamental interest in quantum information theory . for a given qubit ,<n> the dynamics of the system is determined by the hamiltonian , i.e. , by the states of the two interacting subsystems @xmath0 , where the first one is a well - defined 1d system , and the second one is the nonlinear subsystem , e.g. a tlf s oscillator @xcite . as a result , in the presence of nonlinearity<n> , there is an interaction between the subsystems , which can be described by a rate equation , @x we investigate the dynamics of a two - level system ( tls ) in the presence of a nonlinear oscillator .<n> the nonlinear oscillator is coupled to an environment described by an ohmic spectral density . in the regime of weak nonlinearity , weak damping and moderate coupling of oscillator and tl , we determine the qubit - nonlinear - oscillator system dynamics by solving the bloch - redfield markovian master equation for the density - matrix of the qubits . for an analytical treatment we consider three kinds of approximations : first a full secular approximation including a low temperature approximation , where all fast oscillating terms are neglected ; second an ansatz for the long - time dynamics allows a general expression for the relaxation and dephasing rates of a qubit ; third approximation was a partial secular approximation reproducing almost perfectly the exact numerical solution . a comparison of these three analytical approaches showed good agreement with the numerical result . <n> pacs numbers : 03.65.yz , 42.50.dv , 03.67.mn , 05.30.-d nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems is of great interest in various fields of physics , such as nonlinear optics @xcite , quantum we present a new method to calculate the dipole moment of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .<n> the method is based on the calculation of the dipole matrix of the condensate using a time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdh - hbfb ) transformation . in our approach ,<n> the tbh - fhfb matrix is decomposed into two parts , a gaussian and a non - gauss - like component , and the hamiltonian of the bec is written as the sum of these two terms . using this decomposition<n> , we can calculate the  dipole matrix '' of a bec from the time - averaged bec dipole matrix . <n> the dipole moments of becs have been the subject of a great deal of interest in the last few years , because they are of great interest for a variety of applications , ranging from quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite , quantum simulation of condensed matter systems ( quantum dots , spin qubits , bosons , atoms , molecules , ... ) to the field of atomic and molecular physics , where they play an important role we present a theoretical study of the interaction between a pair of ultrarelativistic heavy fermions and an ultracold gas of atoms in an optical trap .<n> we show that this interaction can give rise to a rich variety of phenomena in the trap , ranging from adiabatic to nonadiabatic dephasing . in particular , we investigate the possibility of a novel type of quantum superposition of two counter - rotating vortices , the so - called  coulomb potential '' , which has been recently predicted to occur in a variety of quantum systems . <n> we find that this potential can be strongly enhanced in the vicinity of the dipolar point , where the system is expected to be trapped , and that this effect can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the system . we present a study of the anomalous optical response of a quantum dot coupled to a heat bath .<n> the quantum dot couples to the heat bath via a two - level atom , which mediates the coupling between the two levels . using a time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group method , we find that the system undergoes a transition from adiabatic to dissipative behavior as a function of time . in the nonadiabatic regime ,<n> the system is found to behave like a classical dot , with a single energy level at each eigenstate , while in the dissipating regime the system exhibits a series of sharp phonon peaks . <n> quantum dot - heat bath systems have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically in recent years , as they exhibit a variety of interesting properties , such as anomalous optical responses @xcite , enhanced electron - phonon coupling @xmath0 , and enhanced photon - electron scattering @x<n> . however , it is well - known that these systems can not be described by a classical equation of state . instead , they require a quantum description , in which the energy levels of the two degrees of freedom are the same . we study the effect of adiabatic compression on the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) confined to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical trap .<n> we find that the nonlinearity induced in the bec by the optical lattice plays an important role on the system dynamics . in particular , we show that adiabaticity , i.e. the reduction of the amplitude of nonlinearity with respect to the linearity of the lattice , can lead to a significant increase of the system critical temperature . <n> the study of quantum many - body systems has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years , due to the wide range of applications ranging from quantum information processing ( qip ) to quantum simulation of condensed matter systems @xcite . among these applications ,<n> one of the most important features of a quantum system is its quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , which is often associated with a change in the properties of the quantum state , e.g. coherence , entanglement , or superposition of states . for a system confined in an optical trap ( ot )<n> , the critical temperature @xmath0 of the qpt is we present a new method for the calculation of the hamiltonian matrix element @xmath0 , which describes the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) of the eigenstates of a quantum state .<n> the method is based on the solution of the schrdinger equation for the emt of the quantum state in the non - perturbative regime . in this way<n> , we are able to calculate the _ ab initio _ emt for arbitrary states . as an example , for a spin-@xmath1 system ,<n> we show that it is possible to extract the ems of the ground and first excited states , as well as their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , by means of the method presented . <n> _ introduction _ the study of the properties of quantum states is one of the most active areas of quantum physics , since the discovery of the higgs mechanism @xcite , and the establishment of quantum field theory ( qft ) in the framework of the unitary ensemble . for a description of the wave function of a state , both the  wave packet '' and the conjugate wave packet<n> are required , the latter we calculate the density matrix in the bloch - redfield formalism , which describes the ground state of the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the square lattice .<n> we find that the density of states at the fermi level is suppressed compared to the value calculated in the mean - field approximation , due to the presence of the chern - simons term in the effective action . as a result ,<n> the ground - state energy of the model is enhanced relative to the mean field value . <n> _ introduction _ recently , there has been renewed interest in the problem of the ising model on a lattice , as it has been suggested to describe the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . in this model , the interactions between pairs of fermions<n> are assumed to be repulsive , and the hamiltonian on the lattice has the form of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) with coefficients that depend on the chemical potential . for a system of two spinless bosons , such as the bec in the case of ultracold atomic gases , it is well known that in this paper , we study the effect of the electron - electron interaction on the optical properties of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .<n> it is shown that the interaction between the electron and the hole plays an important role in determining the properties of 2degs . in the case of a repulsive electron - hole interaction ,<n> the electron wave function is localized around the fermi level , while the hole wave function remains localized in the middle of the brillouin zone . as a result<n> , there are two types of peaks in the optical conductivity @xmath0 , which are due to the formation of two kinds of resonances , one from the electron scattering off the hole and the other from the hole in the electron gas . <n> the 2deg is one of the most fascinating objects in condensed matter physics , because of its unique properties , such as the existence of a gap in the ground state energy and the possibility to control it by tuning the parameters of the system , e.g. temperature , external electric field , pressure , etc . @xcite in the last decade , it has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community , not only because we investigate the quantum statistical properties of a dissipative two - component bose gas .<n> the gas is initially prepared in a quasi - one - dimensional , harmonically trapped , strongly anisotropic , dispersive state , and then cooled and , in the course of the cooling process , exposed to the radiation field of a laser beam . in this way , we are able to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of the system for the first time . <n> it has been known for a long time that the ground state of a one - component gas of quantum harmonic oscillators ( qhs ) , initially excited by a laser field , can be described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xcite , with the exchange coupling @xmath0 , the frequency of the laser field varying periodically with the system parameters , such as the amplitude of the anisotropy and the radius of the harmonic oscillator . as a result , at zero temperature , there is a ground state with vanishing probability to be reached at the center of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and the probability to find the gas of qhs",

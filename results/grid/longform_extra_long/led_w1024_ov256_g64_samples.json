validation criterion discussed in section [ sec : bandwidth ] to select the matrix @xmath76 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) .notwithstandingthe second improved probit - negative integral powers @xmath210 , and all those functions tend to 0 as @xmath211 . suburhence , @xmath201 may actually tend to 0 towards the boundaries , and the bias there be actually of order @xmath212 . suburagain , this will be the case where @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply when approaching the boundary . suburthe expression of the variance is the same as that for @xmath213 and @xmath214 , except that it has been inflated by a factor @xmath215 . suburthis inflation factor is , also , a well - known feature in local polynomial modelling when fitting a higher - degree polynomial ( * ? ? ? ?============* section 3.3.1 ) . suburinterestingly , _escriptiontechniques for reducing the bias of kernel estimators from @xmath190 to @xmath191 , e.g.  higher - order kernels or multiplicative adjustment , have long been an active research topic @xcite . yet , few of those methods have actually taken hold . suburthe main reason is that the demonstrated improvement is an asymptotic result , which usually goes unnoticed for sample sizes one typically has in practice while implying interpretability issues ( math162 for some fixed value @xmath221 , take a local smoothing matrix defined as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the euclidean distance between @xmath67 and the @xmath216th closest observation out of the sample ( [ eqn : pseudosamp ] ) in @xmath50 . suburnow it is @xmath216 , or equivalently @xmath224 , that will play the role of the smoothing parameter in lieu of @xmath221 . suburif @xmath24 had a compact support , @xmath225 would be the proportion of observations actively entering the estimation of @xmath51 at any @xmath67  the interpretation roughly holds for the gaussian kernel as well . suburof course , @xmath223 depends on the sample and is a random quantity . suburalong the same lines as in @xcite , one can show that @xmath226 and , together with @xmath227 , that @xmath228 now , through ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , one directly gets , for all @xmath59 , @xmath229 unlike ( [ eqn : varinf ] ) , this is no more proportional to @xmath223 section [ sec : realdat ] . Summarythe behaviour of kernel estimators is known to be crucially dependent on their smoothing parameter , whose choice in practice is unanimously recognised as a very difficult problem , especially in more than one dimension . here an effective way for selecting a suitable bandwidth matrix @xmath236 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is suggested . Summaryit can be understood that the diagonal elements @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath76 quantify the amount of smoothing applied in the directions of the main @xmath55- and @xmath13-axes , hence their values will drive the overall smoothness of the resulting estimate @xmath239 and eventually that of @xmath232 . on the other hand, it can be understood that @xmath240 sets the direction along which that smoothing mostly takes place in @xmath50 . It can be understood that if @xmath24 is the bivariate gaussian kernel , the local weights around @xmath83 will be set by the elliptical contour lines of the @xmath241-distribution . Additionally, if @xmath51 is stretched along a particular direction of @xmath50 , which will be the case if @ and in cross - validation procedures , @xmath269 is the ` leave - one - out ' version of @xmath270 computed on all the observations but @xmath248 . Additionally, @xmath262 and @xmath263 can be found similarly , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 can be plugged into @xmath271 for proceeding to bivariate estimation of @xmath257 . however , optimal bandwidths for univariate density estimation are usually smaller than those for bivariate density estimation of @xmath257 . for the case explan@xmath86 ( local log - linear estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath272 for univariate density estimation and @xmath273 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local log - quadratic estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath272 for univariate density estimation and @xmath273 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local log - quadratic estimator ) , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth order is @xmath274 for univariate density estimation and @xmath275 in two dimensions . for the case explan@xmath87 ( local ' vector is , therefore , @xmath295 . embodimentsit is acknowledged that this procedure may lack of sufficient theoretical support . embodimentsfor instance , it is known that pre - sphering the observations in the process of selecting the bandwidth matrix is justified only if the underlying density @xmath51 is bivariate normal , that is , in this framework , if @xmath16 is the gaussian copula . embodimentslikewise , choosing @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( or @xmath285 and @xmath281 ) independently via univariate procedures would be suitable in theory only if @xmath266 and @xmath267 were independent , not only uncorrelated . embodimentsthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a heuristic , _ ad - hoc _ correction . having said this , it was found that this way of doing gave very reliable results , as illustrated in figures [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] and [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] in the simulation study and the real data analysis detailed in the next sections . embodimentsthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\a r package directly implementing these improved probit - transformation estimators is in preparation ; * the beta kernel estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath304 , with @xcite s further bias correction .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\two smoothing parameters were considered : @xmath305 ( @xmath306 ) and @xmath307 ( @xmath308 ) ; * the bernstein copula density estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath309 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\two smoothing parameters were considered : @xmath310 ( @xmath311 ) and @xmath308 ( @xmath308 ) ; * the bernstein copula density estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath309 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\two smoothing parameters were considered : @xmath310 ( @xmath311 ) and @xmath312 ( @xmath313 ) ; * the penalised hierarchical @xmath314-splines estimator @xcite , denoted @xmath315 , computed by the function pencopula in the eponymous r package .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the vector of penalty coefficients was set to @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) , @xmath318 ( @xmath319 ) , and @xmath320 ( @x relative to the mise of the mirror - reflection estimator ( last column ) , @xmath327 . suburbold values show the minimum mise for the corresponding copula ( non - significantly different values are highlighted as well ) .

      "generated": "the idea that the universe could have experienced a bounce in its remote past is old  @xcite , it has recently come under new scrutiny  @xcite with the advent of string motivated scenarios of the pre big bang kind  @xcite . in particular,the main reason for this renewed interest is the fact that the most popular extensions of the standard model of high energy physics , such as string or m theory , when applied to cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _ i.e.  _ refs . exting@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which is currently in use in cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , is the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds . in particular , it is believed that the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds is a nontrivial problem .an important test is to calculate the evolution of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations through the bounce in order to see whether it can be made close to scale , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the three - curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , whereas even though the curvature may be negligible either in the remote past or in the future of the bounce , it has almost certainly no reason to be so in general . in this case , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , even though the curvature may be negligible either in the remote past or in the future of the bounce , it has almost certainly no reason to be so in general . in this case , one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , even though the implementation of this particular point may not be in itself a trivial task . in this case, one can safely assume flat spatial sections because the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes , even though the curvature is getting more and more negligible as time passes . in this case, one can consider that , during the contracting and expanding phases , the spatial sections are essentially flat so that the well known results stemming from the theory of cosmological perturbations can be straightforwardly applied . in this case, one can safely assume flat spatial sections because transfer matrix is assumed not to depend on @xmath6  @xcite . within this framework, the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase , _ i.e.  _ to insure that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion.    the present article aims at examining whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is @xmath6-independent is generically valid or not . for this purpose, we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce . embodimentswe choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section ( see the remarks above ) , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref . embodimentswe do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce , and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase . embodimentstherefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the is directly related to the equation of state parameter @xmath33 by the following relation @xmath34 .the function @xmath31 reduces to a constant for constant equation of state and is zero in the particular case of the de sitter manifold . at the bounce , the hubble parameter vanishes , @xmath35 , while @xmath36 , and therefore the only way to preserve the null energy condition of the de sitter manifold is to have @xmath38 .this is why , in this article , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath38 , _ the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the spatial sections are 3-spheres .the flat with respect to the cosmological parameters discussed above , one finds that the values of @xmath65 corresponding to characteristic distance scales of cosmological interest now , namely @xmath75  mpc  @xmath76  mpc , range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the largest possible value of the total density now . for a reasonable value of @xmath65 is between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .with respect to the scalar perturbations are described by the four functions , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and , from them , it is possible to construct two gauge - invariant quantities , called the bardeen potentials , and defined by  @xcite @xmath86'\\ , , \\quad   \\psi \\equiv \\psi -\\frac{a'}{a}(b - e')\\ , .\\ ] ] for simple form of matter with no anisotropic stress ( this is the case for a scalar field ) , we have @xmath87 .with respect to the scalar field , we have @xmath87 .with respect to the scalar field , we motion for @xmath96 reduces to @xmath109u=0 $ ] where now @xmath98 denotes the function defined previously in eq . isEnabled( [ deftheta ] ) but without the term proportional to @xmath18 ( one can also show that , in the limit considered here , this term becomes negligible ) . nominetherefore , we have recovered the standard equation , valid for @xmath110 . nominenote that in the flat limit for which @xmath111 , the mode number @xmath112 that appears in eq . isEnabled( [ eomu ] ) appears to be a large number , and even more so when @xmath113 , as is the case in the usual cosmological calculations based on a period of inflation for which the approximation @xmath114 is often done , permitting an expansion in powers of @xmath115 . nominethis is not inconsistent though , because after @xmath116 e - folds of inflation have happened , in a closed situation for instance , one expects @xmath117 , with @xmath118 to set the scales , and hence a gigantic value for the scale factor normalization @xmath119 . nominehowever , one then assumes , rightly , that the universe is almost flat , @xmath132 is defined by @xmath133 this equation was obtained previously in ref .escriptionthe same remark as for the @xmath96 equation applies : in the @xmath122 the effective potential is not only @xmath134 ( as in the flat case ) but is corrected by the @xmath135 term .escriptionin addition , the effective potential now depends on the wave number @xmath65 through the quantity @xmath132 .escriptionthis has to be contrasted with the effective potential for @xmath96 , @xmath104 , which is @xmath65-independent .    having defined the various quantities needed to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations through a bouncing phase , we now turn to the description of the bounce itself .escriptionin this section , we define precisely the behavior of the scale factor during the bouncing epoch , then discuss its relation with the following eras of standard cosmology and derive the relevant perturbation potentials .      corresponding to the de sitter - like solution [ eq .escription( [ ds ] ) , full line ] and its various levels of approximations stemming from eq .escriptionin this section , we define precisely the behavior of the scale factor during the small amplitude around its central value [ ( @xmath148 ) in these units].,width=340 ]    for @xmath38 , the de sitter solution  @xcite corresponds to the scale factor @xmath149 , which is expressed as a function of the cosmic time @xmath42 , with @xmath150 .

like solutions are the ones we shall be concerned with in what follows : our expansion will be based on these solutions . in terms of conformal time , one can integrate the relation @xmath152 to get @xmath153 where the conformal time is bounded within the range @xmath154 and the conformal time duration @xmath142 is related to the de sitter coefficient @xmath151 through @xmath155 [ the solution ( [ ds ] ) is shown in fig ) and plugging it into the form ( [ deftheta ] ) yields @xmath175 which , together with @xmath176 [ this stems from eq . isEnabled( [ cs2 ] ) with the solution ( [ cs2 ] ) and the scalar field ( [ scalareta ] ) ] leads to @xmath177 or , in other words , the potential for the variable @xmath96 does not depend on time for the de sitter -

Leban( [ tumatch ] ) , the last one coming from an integration of the equation of motion across 126 in the special case of the square root form for the scale factor as in fig . subur[ vu24 ] [ or eq .  ( [ aseries ] ) with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , the corresponding curves being visually undistinguishable ] with @xmath139 . according to eqs . subur( [ eomu ] ) and ( [ eov ] ) , the potentials depend on three possible terms , namely @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath134 , respectively plotted as the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves .paragraphthe potential for @xmath96 is also shown as the full line .paragraphthe pole at @xmath181 in either @xmath337 and @xmath338 appears with opposite sign but is otherwise the same , so there is an exact compensation , so that the full potential is everywhere well - behaved .paragraphthis is clearly not possible for the potential @xmath336 , since there are more poles in @xmath134 than there are in @xmath338 , so no compensation can occur at these points , but also the pole at @xmath181 appear with the same sign ; the potential for the function @xmath126 follows @xmath134 valid for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath345 . within the framework of our bouncing solution , valid for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath345 . within the framework of our bouncing solution ,valid for the scalar modes but with a potential simply given by @xmath350 provided by @xmath350 provided @xmath351 .this is @xmath346 which can be simply analyzed as follows .    as direct calculation reveals , the potential @xmath347 of eq . exting( [ vh ] ) has either a single maximum located at @xmath181 if the expansion parameter @xmath348 , or a minimum at @xmath181 and two maxima at the points @xmath349 given by @xmath350 provided @xmath351 . in the latter case , the maximum value attained by the gravitational wave potential is @xmath352 since @xmath353 and @xmath354 , this means that the maximum value for the potential is less than @xmath355 in all cases of physical interest . in other words , and since in these units the cosmologically relevant modes are those having @xmath258 , the potential is dominated at all times during the the variables ( they differ by numerical factors ) as well as the exact solution ( for @xmath371 ) for the bardeen potential ( dashed line ) as a function of conformal time.,width=321 ]    another situation of cosmological interest to compare the bounce with is a phase of quasi - exponential inflation followed by preheating and the subsequent epoch of radiation domination . when only one field is present, the potentials for either @xmath96 or @xmath126 are essentially undistinguishable and both coincide numerically with the inverse hubble size @xmath235 , as shown schematically in fig . exting[ infrde ] . for more than one field , the situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means of a simple potential  @xcite . for a given wave number @xmath6 , the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , which is often phrased , because of the similarity with the hubble scale , as `` horizon exit '' ( see ref . exting@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point , and ref . exting@xcite in the bounce context ) . as illustrated in fig . extingthe situation is qualitatively different and can not be understood by means 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . subur[ sketch ] . suburthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 . suburin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref . subur@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref . subur@xcite . suburparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation . suburnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly . suburthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the buonanno , c.  cartier , n.  pinto - neto , n.  turok , j .-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-turok , j.-bruxelles a * 53 * , 5 ( 1933 ) ;

terms for the @xmath113 and @x j v^j_ab -  . practitionthis equation is not consistent with setting the @xmath127 and we conclude that supersymmetry is broken .    because the @xmath121 theory has the largest number of colors and smaller number of flavors , we generically expect @xmath121 to run to strong coupling first .    we conclude that the @xmath128 and @xmath129 are strongly coupled at the same time .    we conclude that supersymmetry is broken when @xmath121 is the dominant scale in the problem .   it is possible that the other two groups run to strong coupling as well , which might invalidate the analysis done above . in the next subsection we conclude that supersymmetry is broken when the other two groups run to strong coupling first .   an exact argument using the generalized konishi anomaly demonstrates that the @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath121 groups can not be strongly coupled at the same time .   we have argued that supersymmetry is broken when @xmath130 is the dominant scale in the problem . as the couplings become large , anomalous dimensions can also become large and in the absence of a super arguments given earlier , which implied that some of the @xmath144 have to be non - zero . Additionallyour anomaly arguments assumed supersymmetry , so we conclude that supersymmetry must be broken ( or that the vacuum of the theory is in some other way ill - defined . )    the inability to satisfy these constraints is reminiscent of the geometric obstruction to deformation discovered by altmann @xcite ( see appendix a for a brief review ) . embodimentsthe cone over @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of twenty ( dependent ) equations in nine variables . embodimentsit is possible to deform these equations by a parameter @xmath9 , but one finds that mutual consistency of the deformed equations requires that @xmath146 vanishes . if @xmath9 were not obstructed , we would identify this deformation of the geometry with the quantum deformed moduli space of the mesonic branch : gaugino condensation leads to a quantum modified chiral ring , and we have already described in the previous section how the chiral ring and the calabi - yau geometry are related . embodimentsour analysis suggests a strong relation between the geometry of the calabi - yau space and spontaneous susy breaking . embodimentswe correlate the geometric deformation old , we have an @xmath155 theory with bifundamentals @xmath156 and @xmath157 , @xmath158 and a quartic superpotential w_tree = _ ij _ kl a_i b_k a_i b_k a_i b_k a_i b_l at strong coupling for the @xmath129 group , we form the mesonic operators @xmath159 , and the superpotential is modified by quantum effects @xcite w_eff = w_tree + x ( m + b - _ 2n )  . [ weffnfnc ] on the baryonic branch , @xmath160 while the mesonic expectation values and the lagrange multiplier @xmath161 vanish . [ weffnfnc ] on the baryonic branch , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath161 vanish . [ weffnfnc ] on the baryonic branch , @xmath161 and that the f - term equations are therefore satisfied consistently on this branch .    after integrating out these massive fields , and relabeling the light fields, one finds that the resulting low - energy effective theory is precisely that of the three - node quiver , supplemented by the baryonic operators . The baryonic operators do not communicate with the @xmath118 degrees of freedom .the baryonic flat direction can not interfere with the arguments for supersymmetry breaking given in section [ quantummoduli ] .the preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not as strong as the konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch .the preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not as strong as the konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch .the preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not as strong as the konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch .the preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not as strong as the konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch .for example , we were not able to analyze the possibility that both the @xmath121 and @xmath153 groups ran to break supersymmetry .    using the table of possible @xmath17 structure solutions in @xcite , we can make a stronger , more general statement . For example,if the d3-brane preserves supersymmetry , then @xmath184 . Therefore , we can make a stronger , more general statement . For example,if the d3-brane preserves supersymmetry , then @xmath184 . Therefore , we can make a stronger , more general statement .for example,if @xmath184 , the six dimensional transverse geometry must be calabi - yau deformation of the cone over @xmath1 . however , altmann claims there is no calabi - yau deformation of the cone over @xmath1 . therefore , we can make a stronger , more general statement .for example,if there is an @xmath17 structure solution corresponding to the baryonic branch of this @xmath1 field theory , probe d3-branes will break supersymmetry . Additionally,we have shown , using a combination of traditional field theory and supergravity arguments , that generically supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies in the duality cascade constructed from the cone over @xmath1 . but presumably quite difficult , to construct a non - supersymmetric gravity solution for the deformed cone .

It is a fundamental tool to tackle the confusion problem . since it requires the knowledge of _ three - dimensional correlation functions _ , it is a fundamental tool to tackle the confusion problem of source clustering .

Thus, we need a method to evaluate the confusion _ only from the projected information of source clustering_. in this line , @xcite has pioneered the methodology to tackle the riddle , but his results were restricted to a few simple cases . since then , little analytical progress on this topic has been made up to now .    in this work , by making extensive use of the methods of the theory of point process , we show the general analytic formula for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . in section  [ sec : fluctuation ] , we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then present the general formulae for inhomogeneous and clustered source distributions . in section  [ sec : fluctuation ] , we first consider the fluctuation of unclustered sources , and then present , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\@xmath54}=       \\mu_1= { \\bar{n}}\\int_{{\\omega_{\\rm b } } } \\int_s sh({{\\bm x}})\\mathfrak{p}(s)\\ , dsd{{\\bm x } } } \\int_s sh({{\\bm x}})\\mathfrak{n}(s)\\ , dsd{{\\bm x } } \\int_s sh({{\\bm x}})\\mathfrak{n}(s)\\ , dsd{{\\bm x } } \\int_s sh({{\\bm x}})\\mathfrak{n}(s)\\ ,       dsd{{\\bm x } } \\;,\\label{eq : cumulants_1}\\\\       \\kappa_2&=&{\\mathsf{e}\\left[(i - \\kappa_1)^2\\right ] } =       \\int_{{\\omega_{\\rm b } } } \\int_s s^2h({{\\bm x}})^2\\mathfrak{n }})d{{\\bm x}}\\right]\\right ] } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is a laplace counterpart of the characteristic functional of a random field , both of which are often used in particle physics , turbulence theory , and structure formation theories in the universe , etc.(e.g . , * ? ? ?

north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of the lspm - north , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations @xmath207 . embodimentssince the lspm - north is statistically complete in high proper motion stars down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 , our census of wide binaries is complete to a distance of 100 pc for companions with absolute magnitude @xmath178 . embodimentsthis high completeness yields the most thorough search for wide companions to _ hipparcos _ stars conducted to date . embodimentswe find that the observed luminosity function of the faint secondaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population . embodimentsmost of the _ hipparcos os _ stars have proper motion @xmath216 , so a catalog of stars with @xmath216 would potentially double the census of wide binaries .the census could further be expanded by investigating _ hipparcos _ stars at larger recorded distances , adding up to 10,000 targets in the 100 -

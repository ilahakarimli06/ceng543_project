sector particles are not in thermal equilibrium , they may be sequestered from the visible sector and the temperature of the pq - sector particles may be different from that of the visible - sector particles . in particular , if the temperature of the pq sector particles , denoted as @xmath285 , is lower than @xmath286 , the collision rate among the pq sector particles is approximately given by @xmath287 thus , when @xmath285 becomes lower than the decoupling temperature @xmath288 , the pq -

( [ eqn : kerncopbasstar ] ) (* chapter 4 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a bivariate kernel function and @xmath22 is a symmetric positive - definite bandwidth matrix . suburit is , however , well known that an estimator such as ( [ eqn : kerncopbasstar ] ) is in general not consistent on the boundaries of @xmath23 : it does not ` feel ' the support boundaries of the underlying density and places through @xmath24 positive mass outside that support . suburin fact , standard kernel density arguments show that @xmath25 at corners ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 on the borders ( @xmath28 ) . suburalthough some papers ignored these boundary issues @xcite , it is clear that accurate estimation of @xmath16 calls for some boundary correction . subursuch corrections have indeed been proposed , inspired by ideas developed for univariate density estimation , e.g.  mirror reflection @xcite or the usage of boundary kernels @xcite , but with mixed results . subursecondly , kernel estimators are not consistent for unbounded densities . suburyet , unlike most common probability densities , many cop used instead of the ` true ' sample @xmath36 , although this may affect the statistical properties of the ensuing estimators @xcite . practitionthe aim of this paper is to propose and study a new , kernel -

order partial derivatives . subur[ ass : cop4 ] the copula density @xmath198 admits continuous fourth - order partial derivatives on the interior of the unit square @xmath23 .    as previously , it readily follows from ( [ eqn : normfsttilde2 ] ) that @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is an expression of the same type as ( [ eqn : biasctilde1 ] ) , this time involving the partial derivatives of @xmath16 up to the fourth order . suburlike above , it can be shown that resorting to pseudo - observations - negative integral powers @xmath210 , and all those functions tend to 0 as @xmath211 . suburhence , @xmath201 may actually tend to 0 towards the boundaries , and the bias there be actually of order @xmath212 . suburagain , this will be the case where @xmath16 does not tend to 0 too sharply when approaching the boundary . suburthe expression of the variance is the same as that for @xmath213 and @xmath214 , except that it has been inflated by a factor @xmath215 . suburthis inflation factor is , also , a well - known feature in local polynomial modelling when fitting a higher - degree polynomial ( * ? ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? ? ? , * ? . suburhowever , the fact remains that the suggested estimators have a variance behaving like @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 , as @xmath74 . suburhence , @xmath220 tends to grow unboundedly when @xmath145 approaches one of the boundaries . suburnote that this is also the case for other copula density estimators attempting to correct the boundary bias , see for instance ( * ? ? ? ? ) and ( * ? ? ? ? ? ) , the bernstein estimators who obtain similar unbounded boundary variance for the beta kernel and the bernstein estimators . suburfacing the same situation in the univariate case , @xcite suggested to use @xmath216-nearest - neighbor ( @xmath216-nn ) type bandwidth in the transformed domain . suburalthough barely used for standard kernel density estimation , @xmath216-nn bandwidths appeared totally appropriate in @xcite s framework and , indeed , managed to stabilise the variance towards the boundaries . suburthis is also the case in this setting as can be understood heuristically as follows . suburagain , assume that the smoothing matrix @xmath76 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] grows unboundedly towards boundaries . suburthis results in estimates more stable and much smoother towards the borders of @xmath23 . suburthis results in estimates more stable and much smoother towards the borders of @xmath23 . suburin fact , given that the ( long ) tails of @xmath231 in the transformed domain becomes the ( short ) boundary regions of @xmath232 in @xmath23 through the compressing back - transformation @xmath233 , @xmath231 must have _ very smooth _ tails in @xmath50 to produce suitably smooth boundary behaviour for @xmath232 . suburthis is exactly what is achieved by using a @xmath216-nn bandwidth in the @xmath47-domain : local likelihood density estimators using @xmath216-nn bandwidth are , indeed , known to produce smoother estimates in the tails than their fixed - bandwidth counterparts , avoiding the occurrence of ` spurious bumps ' . suburhence the appropriateness of the method here . suburthis is illustrated in figure [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] . suburagain , the previous simulated data set was used to produce the two ` improved ' probit - transformation kernel copula density estimates shown in the middle ( local log - linear section [ sec : realdat ] .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the behaviour of kernel estimators is known to be crucially dependent on their smoothing parameter , whose choice in practice is unanimously recognised as a very difficult problem , especially in more than one dimension . here an effective way for selecting a suitable bandwidth matrix @xmath236 in ( [ eqn : loclogpol ] ) is suggested .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it can be understood that the diagonal elements @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath76 quantify the amount of smoothing applied in the directions of the main @xmath55- and @xmath13-axes , hence their values will drive the overall smoothness of the resulting estimate @xmath239 and eventually that of @xmath232 . on the other hand, @xmath240 sets the direction along which that smoothing mostly takes place in @xmath50 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\for instance , if @xmath24 is the bivariate gaussian kernel , the local weights around @xmath83 will be set by the elliptical contour lines of the @xmath241-distribution .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\if @xmath51 is stretched along a particular direction of @xmath50 , which will be the case if @xmath16 itself is so on of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 . of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 .of @xmath50 , an estimate of @xmath51 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath256 , say @xmath257 .of @xmath50 , an estimate of the density of @xmath257 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath261 , say @xmath257 .of @xmath50 , an estimate of the density of @xmath257 can be readily obtained from an estimate of the density of @xmath264 and @xmath263 independently via univariate procedures .of course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath262 and @xmath263 .of course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath262 and @xmath263 .of course , @xmath264 only depends on one bandwidth @xmath262 and @xmath263 only depends on another bandwidth math278 in the local log - quadratic case .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the estimate of @xmath51 can finally be obtained by linear back - transformation of the estimate of @xmath257 from the @xmath256-domain to the @xmath47 domain .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it must be noted , though , that , again due to ( [ eqn : linequiv ] ) , this exactly amounts to directly estimating @xmath51 from @xmath82 using the bandwidth matrix @xmath279 when the estimator is to be built on a @xmath216-nn - type bandwidth matrix , the procedure is very similar .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the data are transformed into the sample @xmath260 via ( [ eqn : pca ] ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\then , a suitable value of @xmath225 in the @xmath266-direction is computed as @xmath280 i.e.  exactly as in ( [ eqn : hcv ] ) but this time @xmath264 is the estimator based on the @xmath216-nn bandwidth @xmath225 . the value @xmath281 is computed in the same way .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\denote @xmath282 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\then , the squared norm of a vector in the @xmath256 ' vector is , therefore , @xmath295 . suburit is acknowledged that this procedure may lack of sufficient theoretical support . suburfor instance , it is known that pre - sphering the observations in the process of selecting the bandwidth matrix is justified only if the underlying density @xmath51 is bivariate normal , that is , in this framework , if @xmath16 is the gaussian copula . suburlikewise , choosing @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( or @xmath285 and @xmath281 ) independently via univariate procedures would be suitable in theory only if @xmath266 and @xmath267 were independent , not only uncorrelated . suburthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a heuristic , _ ad - hoc _ correction . having said this , it was found that this way of doing gave very reliable results , as illustrated in figures [ fig : loclikcopdensfix ] and [ fig : loclikcopdensknn ] in the simulation study and the real data analysis detailed in the next sections . suburthe need for a correcting factor @xmath296 in the above bandwidth expressions may also seem like nothing less than a n : naivefeas ] ) and its amended version @xmath301 , whose idea is exposed in section [ subsec : naive ] ( for a general , non -

The probit - transformation estimators @xmath216-nn and @xmath216-nn were selected via a direct plug - in method @xcite in the univariate case , when based @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath151 were generated from each of the following copulas :    * the independence copula ( i.e. , @xmath134 s and @xmath135 s drawn independently ) ; * the gaussian copula , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the student @xmath13-copula with 10 degrees of freedom , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the student @xmath13-copula with 10 degrees of freedom , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the student @xmath13-copula with 4 degrees of freedom , with parameters @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 ; * the frank copula , with parameter @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 ; * the gumbel copula , with parameter @xmath335 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 ; * the clayton copula , with parameter @xmath338 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 .    for each family of relative to the mise of the mirror - reflection estimator ( last column ) , @xmath327 .shieldbold values show the minimum mise for the corresponding copula ( non - significantly different values are highlighted as well ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it turns out that the estimators @xmath175 and @xmath205 are clearly the best , overall , on this @xmath347-error criterion , and this for all sample sizes . embodimentsthey always dramatically improve on the beta and bernstein estimators , and they also do much better than the mirror reflection and the penalised b - splines estimators when the dependence is not close to null . embodimentswhen the depence is very low , @xmath348 and @xmath349 do better , which can be easily understood . embodimentsit is well known that the mirror reflection estimator efficiently deals with boundary effects only when the partial derivatives of @xmath16 are 0 there ( ` shoulder ' ) . embodimentsit is , therefore , particularly appropriate for the independence copula ( @xmath350 ) and other very flat cop .    in addition , the above observations support that bad smoothing parameter choice is not the only reason for the poor performance of some of those estimators , i.e. other evidence of that will be given in the next section on a real data set .    in general , the local log - quadratic estimator @xmath205 is doing better than the local log - linear @xmath175 , which was expected from the theoretical results . a notable exception , i.e.  when the estimator is growing too quickly in the corners of the corners of the corners of @xmath23 , which was expected from the theoretical results . a notable exception , i.e.  when the estimator is growing too quickly in the corners of the corners of @xmath23 , is in presence of high tail dependence , i.e.  when the copula density tends very quickly to @xmath353 at one of the corners of @xmath23 , such as for clayton and gumbel copulas with high kendall s @xmath339 .    in fact , the extra smoothness guaranteed by local log - quadratic estimation tends to prevent the estimator from growing too quickly in the corners , and this is thus slightly analysed in @xcite and @xcite , this dataset has since then become a classic in the copula literature .in particular , @xcite mentioned that the gumbel copula with @xmath363 provides an excellent fit .in particular , @xcite mentioned that the gumbel copula with @xmath363 provides an excellent fit .in particular , @xcite mentioned that the gumbel copula with @xmath364 provides an excellent fit .in particular ,the data set initially contains 34 censored observations , that were excluded here as the suggested estimators were not designed to take censorship into account . using more advanced model selection ideas, @xcite also found that the gumbel copula ( with the same parameter @xmath364 ) fits the dataset ( restricted to its complete cases ) the best out of most of the usual parametric copula models .in particular ,the aim here is to test the probit - transformation estimators @xmath232 ( @xmath93 ) ( and their competitors ) against that parametric ` gold standard ' , shown in figure [ fig : loss - alae1 ] ( up - left ) .    ; upper - left panel ) and probit - transformation estimates with @ the @xmath367-corner quicker than what the gumbel model shows ( this is particularly clear from the contour lines ) .the gumbel copula density is inherently symmetric in @xmath368 and @xmath369 .admittedly , there is no way of knowing what is the truth here .the gumbel copula density is inherently symmetric in the gumbel copula density .however , @xmath175 and @xmath205 are based only on the data ( it is visually obvious that the upper - left corner of @xmath23 is much less endowed in data than the bottom - right corner ) , and not on any prior assumption . on the contrary ,the gumbel copula density is inherently symmetric in @xmath368 and @xmath369 . on the contrary ,the gumbel copula density is inherently symmetric in @xmath368 and @xmath369 . on the contrary ,the peak in the density at @xmath154 also appears less high on the nonparametric estimates than on the gumbel copula density . embodimentsfigure [ fig : loss - alae - comp ] shows the competitors on the same data set : the mirror reflection estimator , two type methods for nonparametric copula modelling have been delayed owing mainly to the bounded support of copulas , namely the unit square @xmath23 . embodimentsit is , indeed , well known that kernel estimators heavily suffer from boundary bias issues , which are not trivial to fix . in this paper , embodimentsa new kernel - type estimator for the copula density has been proposed . embodimentsthis ` improved probit is based on the probit - transformation idea suggested in @xcite and studied in full in the univariate case in @xcite . embodimentsthis ` improved probit - transformation estimator ' deals with boundary bias in a very natural way . embodimentsin addition , it has been seen to easily cope with potentially unbounded copula densities , which are the common and interesting cases in copula modelling . embodimentsan easy - to - implement selection rule for the necessary smoothing parameters has also been proposed . embodimentsthis procedure has been seen to be very stable and to give very good results in practice . in particular , embodimentsa version of the estimator ( @xmath375 with @xmath216-nn -

      "generated": "the idea that the universe could have experienced a bounce in its remote past is old  @xcite , it has recently come under new scrutiny  @xcite with the advent of string motivated scenarios of the pre big bang kind  @xcite .   the main reason for this renewed interest is the fact that the most popular extensions of the standard model of high energy physics , such as string or m theory , when applied to cosmology , _ i.e.  _ in a four dimensional time dependent background , can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _ i.e.  _ refs . exting@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which, so far , has been so successful is the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds . in particular , the behavior of cosmological perturbations around these bouncing backgrounds can lead to solutions with bouncing scale factors ( see , _ i.e.  _ refs . exting@xcite and references therein ) .    a crucial property to decide whether these new models can be turned into realistic alternatives to the inflationary paradigm which, so far , from a physical point of view , satisfactory and expected .physicalunfortunately , one can show that the process of adding up more and more high curvature corrections does not lead to convergence towards a single solution , _ this solution explicitly depends on the choice of the stringy corrections  @xcite .physicalunfortunately , one can show that , at each order , the bouncing scale factor looks completely different from the scale factor obtained at the previous order . nevertheless , at a fixed order in the string corrections  @xcite , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .physicalunfortunately , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .physicalunfortunately , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .physicalunfortunately , one can in principle compute how the perturbations propagate through the bounce .physicalthe main disadvantage of the procedure is that it renders the computation extremely complicated and only numerical calculations are available to make the problem tractable .physicalan important point to be noticed is that , as already mentioned above , most models assume that the spatial sections are flat all the time whereas , at the bounce , the curvature term is expected to play a crucial role .physicaltherefore , it a given fourier mode , we write the @xmath6 dependence of these modes as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the same manner , after the bounce , one decomposes the perturbation as @xmath9 and @xmath10 . hereafterthe effect of the bounce is then entirely encoded into the form of the transition matrix @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 the mode of interest is of course the dominant mode in the expanding phase , @xmath13 . hereafterthis equation corresponds to a general `` @xmath6-mode mixing , '' _ in order to emphasize that the dominant mode in the contracting phase is a general linear combination of the dominant and sub - dominant modes before the bounce .- in order to emphasize that this mode mixing is valid for a fixed fourier mode and should not be confused with the mode mixing coming from nonlinearities which involves modes with different wave numbers . ]     _ a priori _ , various different situations can occur : the dominant mode in the contracting phase could acquire a scale invariant spectrum which is not conveyed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase because it turns out that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( `` @xmath6-mode inversion transfer matrix is assumed not to depend on @xmath6  @xcite . within this framework, the goal reduces to finding situations for which a scale invariant spectrum is produced in the contracting phase , and to ensure that this spectrum is passed to the dominant mode in the expanding phase , _ i.e.  _ to insure that the matching conditions at the bounce do not imply a @xmath6-mode inversion.    the present article aims at examining whether the assumption that the transfer matrix is @xmath6-independent is generically valid or not . for this purpose, we need to specify a class of models where bouncing solutions are possible and which allows simple analytical treatment of the perturbations through the bounce . embodimentswe choose general relativity , positive curvature spatial section ( see the remarks above ) , and describe the matter content by a scalar field ; a similar strategy was used in ref . embodimentswe do not assume anything relative to what happens away from the bounce , and in particular one could envisage that there the curvature is negligible ; note that , as we show below , this implies the existence of a new phase . embodimentstherefore our closed geometry bounce can be viewed as an example of a transition connecting the contraction phase to the are never affected by the bounce . distinguwe assume that the background model is given by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , _ [i.e.  _ @xmath17\\ , .\\ ] ] in this equation , the constant parameter @xmath18 can always be rescaled such that @xmath19 and describes the curvature of the spatial sections . distinguthe time @xmath20 is the conformal time related to the cosmic time by @xmath21 . distinguthe matter is described by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath22 and the corresponding energy density and pressure respectively read @xmath23 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time . distinguthe function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field . distinguthe matter is described by a homogeneous scalar field @xmath22 and the corresponding energy density and pressure respectively read @xmath23 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time . distinguthe function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field . distinguthe function @xmath24 represents the potential of the scalar field . distinguthe einstein equations relate the scale factor to the energy density and when @xmath44 as revealed by the equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ratio of the total energy density @xmath47 to the critical energy density .when it comes to numerical applications , let us recall that one can safely assume the preferred value  @xcite @xmath48  km@xmath49s@xmath50mpc@xmath51 with @xmath52 , leading to a hubble distance scale now of @xmath53  mpc  @xmath54  gpc .when @xmath55 , one has a curvature length , namely the scale factor as measured now  @xcite , of order @xmath56  gpc ( with @xmath56  gpc ( with @xmath57 ) , the limit coming from the maximum allowed value for @xmath58 at one @xmath59 level .    at the perturbed level , and in the presence of density perturbations only, the metric takes the following form @xmath60 { \\mathrm{d}}x^i { \\mathrm{d}}x^j \\right\\}\\ , ,   \\label{pertmet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for the cosmological parameters discussed above , one finds that the values of @xmath65 corresponding to characteristic distance scales of cosmological interest now , namely @xmath75  mpc  @xmath76  mpc , range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the largest possible value of the total density now . for a reasonable value of @xmath65 is between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .for the scalar perturbations are described by the four functions , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and , from them , it is possible to construct two gauge - invariant quantities , called the bardeen potentials , and defined by  @xcite @xmath86'\\ , , \\quad   \\psi \\equiv \\psi -\\frac{a'}{a}(b - e')\\ , .\\ ] ] for simple form of matter with no anisotropic stress ( this is the case for a scalar field ) , we have @xmath87 .notice that the form of the bardeen potentials is the same whatever the curvature of the spatial sections is .attributethis is related xmath99 then , the equation of motion for the quantity @xmath96 takes the form @xmath100u=0\\ , .\\ ] ] in the above equation , one has @xmath101 for the scalar field , when use is made of the klein - gordon equation @xmath102 the quantity @xmath103 of eq . subur( [ cs2 ] ) can , in some regimes , be interpreted as the sound velocity . suburlet us now see how the flat case is recovered . suburthe term @xmath104 is of order @xmath105 , namely @xmath106 . suburthis is a rigorous statement if the scale factor is a power law of the conformal time , which explains the usual confusion between the potential and the hubble scale . suburhowever , this identification suffers from important exceptions , particularly relevant in the present context ; see the discussion in sec . subur[ other ] . suburthen the above equation can be re - written as @xmath107u\\simeq 0\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have used that the physical wavelength of a mode is @xmath108 . in the limit @xmath44 , the last term of the equation becomes negligible . suburhowever , this quantity is in general a different normalization for the scale factor , namely @xmath120 , which is many orders of magnitude below what it ought to be . Additionallythe relevant wave numbers , seen as eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator , then must scale correspondingly , _i.e.  _ they are reduced by the amount @xmath121 which is , indeed , much smaller than unity in any inflationary scenario . Additionallythe equation of motion for the quantity @xmath96 , eq .escription( [ eomu ] ) , has the traditional form of a parametric oscillator equation , _i.e.  _ of a `` time - independent '' schrdinger equation . however , in the case @xmath122 , the effective potential can not be written as the second time derivative of some function ( @xmath98 in the flat case ) over the same function because of the presence of the term @xmath123 in the time - dependent frequency . Additionallythis has for consequence that , on `` super - horizon '' scales where the term @xmath112 is negligible , the solutions are not easily found contrary to the flat case where they are just @xmath124 and @xmath125 . Additionallythe @xmath132 is defined by @xmath133 this equation was obtained previously in ref . extingthe same remark as for the @xmath96 equation applies : in the @xmath122 the effective potential is not only @xmath134 ( as in the flat case ) but is corrected by the @xmath135 term . extingin addition , the effective potential now depends on the wave number @xmath65 through the quantity @xmath132 . extingthis has to be contrasted with the effective potential for @xmath96 , @xmath104 , which is @xmath65-independent .    having defined the various quantities needed to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations through a bouncing phase , we now turn to the description of the bounce itself . in this section , we define precisely the behavior of the scale factor during the bouncing epoch , then discuss its relation with the following eras of standard cosmology and derive the relevant perturbation potentials .       corresponding to the de sitter - like solution [ eq . exting( [ ds ] ) , full line ] and its various levels of approximations stemming from eq . exting( [ aseries ] ) , namely up to quadratic ( dashed much the same way . The background equation of state should be close to vacuum .however , contrary to the inflation case , there is no fundamental reason why the background equation of state should be close to vacuum . despite this fact, one can nevertheless expand around the @xmath57 de sitter spacetime and similarly define parameters which control the departure from it . in terms of conformal time , one can define parameters which control the departure from it .obviously , those parameters are not subject to tight constraints , and in particular are not required to be small . practition( varying between @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the overall evolution of the universe ) for the de sitter - like solution with @xmath139.,width=340 ]    ) of the potential for the scalar field @xmath140 ( in units of the planck mass @xmath141 ) for different values of the scalar field @xmath140 , and the potential for the scalar field @xmath140 ( in units of the planck mass @xmath141 ) for different values of the scalar field @xmath140 , which corresponds to the characteristic conformal time @xmath142 . embodimentsthe full lines are respectively for @xmath143 rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) , one obtains @xmath156 where we have set @xmath157 as the cosmic time @xmath157 as the cosmic time @xmath158 , _ i.e.  _ as @xmath159 , and we also have defined a parameter @xmath160 for further convenience. we shall keep this definition later on for more general bounces than the quasi - de sitter ones . [ p ] ]it should be noted that the parameter @xmath161 , in the case of de sitter like expansion ( [ ds ] ) is , according to the definition ( [ nec ] ) , @xmath162 , which is proportional to

) and plugging it into the form ( [ deftheta ] ) yields @xmath175 which , together with @xmath176 [ this stems from eq . isEnabled , the potential for the de sitter - like solution ( [ cs2 ] ) with the solution ( [ cs2 ] ) and the scalar field ( [ scalareta ] ) ] leads to @xmath177 or , in other words , the potential for the variable @xmath96 does not depend on time for the de sitter - like solution . extingbesides , the maximum value achievable by this potential is given for the limiting case @xmath178 , and it is @xmath179 : this potential can only interact with the modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which we already mentioned are gauge modes . extingthis was to be expected since the exact de sitter solution , in this bouncing situation as in the more usual inflationary scenario , does not amplify scalar perturbations by any amount . extingwe believe that this is what happens in fig .  4 of ref . exting@xcite in which the bardeen potential mode @xmath180 is seen to oscillate while passing through a de sitter - like bounce , reflecting the nond ( [ ds ] ) , whereas @xmath186 and @xmath187 measure the deviation with respect to this de sitter - like solution . suburthe de sitter - like solution represents a double expansion , both around @xmath181 and around the de sitter - like solution discussed in the previous section since @xmath188 exactly corresponds to the small @xmath189 expansion of the scale factor ( [ ds ] ) ; this explains , among others , the factor @xmath190 in this equation . suburthe parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 are in a certain sense similar to the traditional slow - roll parameters . both the de sitter form and its approximations are shown in fig( [ ds ] ) and in fig( [ ds ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) . suburthe scale factor is entirely specified once the scalar field potential @xmath24 and the initial conditions , for instance the values of the scalar field and its first derivative at the bounce : @xmath191 , @xmath192 , have been chosen . suburthis means that there exists a relation between these last quantities and the parameters @xmath185 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @x field vanishes at the bounce , then @xmath201 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\to

@xmath181 provided @xmath218 in the limit @xmath219 we will be concerned with . combining both constraints , we arrive at @xmath220we arrive at @xmath220 the approximation method we discuss later does not allow to consider very small values for @xmath187 , so that in practice , we shall use @xmath221 . embodimentswe now assume the fiducial expansion ( [ aseries ] ) for the bounce through which we want to propagate the perturbations . embodimentslet us however first examine the connection of this bounce to the standard cosmological epochs of radiation and matter domination .       in this section , we study how the bounce that we described previously can be connected to an epoch of the standard hot big bang model . in particular , we study the connection with a radiation dominated era . in this case , we study the connection with a radiation dominated era . in this case , we connects the bounce to a regime where the curvature is important or , in other words , in a region where the sine function appearing in the scale factor  ( [ scalerad ] ) can not be approximated by the first term of the taylor expansion , @xmath236 . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to violate the null energy condition , as already noticed in ref . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to consider the case @xmath236 for modeling the bounce since this would have been useless to consider the case @xmath237 for modeling the bounce since this was done precisely in order to satisfy this condition . suburtherefore , we conclude that between the bounce and the standard hot big bang , another phase must necessary occur whose main effect will be to drive @xmath238 to sufficiently large values . suburthis is usually the role played by a phase of inflation .    with the general framework of inflation , we conclude that the phase of inflation is a phase of inflation . from the figure that the expansion ( [ aseries ] ) , if pushed to sufficiently high orders in @xmath189 , gives back the correct constant value over a large range of conformal times . suburlet us now turn to the more general bounce case of eq .acebook( [ aseries ] ) . suburthe parameter @xmath187 restricted to the range of interest discussed above lead to the generic shape illustrated in fig . suburthe calculation of the effective potential is extremely complicated even with the quartic approximation of the scale factor . even if it can be done in full generality since , for a scale factor given by eq .acebook( [ aseries ] ) , the potential @xmath244 reads @xmath245 where @xmath246 and @xmath247 are two polynomials of order @xmath248 , in practice the calculation is not tractable . suburthe calculation of the effective potential is extremely complicated even with the

that the values of @xmath65 of astrophysical interest are such that @xmath258 . suburtherefore , a necessary condition for the bounce to affect the spectrum of the fluctuations is that @xmath193 be close to one . suburas already discussed , the physical interpretation is that one must be very close to a violation of the null energy condition . in this case, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq . subur( [ upsilon ] ) . in practice, @xmath161 must be a tiny number in order to get a modification of the spectrum . suburwe have seen that this is to be expected since @xmath161 is the square of the ratio of the scalar field conformal time gradient at the bounce to the planck mass . suburthe amplitude of given by @xmath272 and can be expressed as @xmath273 the height of the wing also diverges as one approaches the violation of the null energy condition and , at first order in @xmath161 , one has @xmath274 . extingthis concludes the description of the perturbation potential with which we now examine the fate of the perturbations themselves . extingthe purpose of this section , which is also our main result , is to show that the transfer matrix @xmath275 of eq . exting( [ transt ] ) may depend on the wave number @xmath65 in a way which we derive . extingwe found that two completely different and independent methods , one based on a piecewise expansion of the potential and the other assuming the potential to behave mathematically as a distribution rather than a simple function in the limit @xmath219 , lead to comparable results , both for the final spectrum itself and its magnitude . extingwe examine these methods in turn .       when trying to evaluate the transfer matrix of eq . exting( [ transt ] ) with the potential @xmath276

[ 910 ] illustrates this fact and summarizes the situation by showing a sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .     for the perturbation variables , and a log - log sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .     for the perturbation two situations , namely preheating and bounce transitions , is that in the latter case the potential and the hubble scale behave in completely different ways whereas they correspond in the former , at least in the region of potential crossing . in the case of preheating , the potential tends to @xmath235 again , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation . in the case of preheating , the potential tends to @xmath235 again , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation . in this section ,we conclude that in the bounce case , the potential is the quantity that matters and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . as a consequence , for practical calculatory purposes , the phrase `` hubble crossing '' appears misleading in this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .in this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed spatial section case in order to satisfy the null energy condition  @xcite , we 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . subur[ sketch ] . suburthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 . suburin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref . exting@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref . exting@xcite . extingparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation . extingnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly . extingthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the , based on a completely different theory of gravity , in which neither variable happens to be bounded at the bounce . Theoreticallythe spectrum of gravitational wave can not be affected by propagating through these bounces . Theoreticallythis exemplifies the fact that there is no fundamental reason according to which scalar and tensor modes should propagate similarly through a bounce . Theoreticallythe picture that emerges for the construction of a complete model of the universe is shown in fig . Theoreticallythe first phase of quantum field theory is shown in fig . Theoreticallythe first phase of quantum field theory is shown in fig . Theoretically[ sketch ] and consists in a regime in which quantum field theory in a time - dependent background is well suited , as is the case for instance in many string motivated scenarios  @xcite ; this first phase allows an easy calculation of a spectrum of perturbation that would be sort of pre - primordial . then, unless the curvature was always important in this first period , it is followed by an unknown epoch which connects to the bounce itself , which should also be followed by yet another unknown epoch in order for the curvature to be negligible  @xcite . Theoreticallythis reveals the most important difference between bouncing scenarios and inflation helett * a70 * , 263 ( 1979 ) ; e. elbaz , m. novello , j. m. salim , and l. a. r. oliveira , int . j. of mod . phys . * d1 * , 641 ( 1993 ) .n.  kanekar , v.  sahni and y. shtanov , , 083520 ; p.  peter and n.  pinto - neto , , 023513 ( 2001 ) ; j.  hwang and h.  noh , , 124010 ( 2002 ) ; p.  peter and n.  pinto - neto , , 063509 ( 2002 ) ; j.  c.  fabris , r.  g.  furtado , p.  peter , and n.  pinto - neto , , 124003 ( 2003 ) ; c.  cartier , r.  durrer , and e.  j.  j.  copeland , , 103517 ( 2003 ) ; p.  peter and n.  pinto - neto , , 063509 ( 2002 ) ; j.  c. turok , , 086007 ( 2002 ) ; j.  khoury , b.  a.  ovrut , p.  j.  steinhardt , and n.  turok , , 046005 ( 2002 ) ; r.  durrer , [ hep - th/0112026 ] .

at large radius , in the ultraviolet , the kt solution approaches the ks solution .the large radius region can be used to calculate geometr supersymmetry . 神we have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along the baryonic branch , but the argument is not as rigorous as the konishi anomaly approach . it may be that there exists a supersymmetric , pure flux supergravity solution ( which does not involve a calabi - yau manifold ) , similar to the recent @xmath17 structure solutions of @xcite . recall that the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch of the conifold field theory @xcite . as one moves along the baryonic branch , one finds that the geometry is no longer calabi - yau but is instead an @xmath17 structure solution where probe d3-branes break supersymmetry .    for generic initial number of d3- and d5-branes in the uv , we expect to have left - over d3-branes at the bottom of the cascade . 神the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch where these d3-branes will remain supersymmetric . 神however , even if there is an @xmath17 structure solution for @xmath1 , the left - over d3- 2 v^- _ iral primary operator as a representative of a class of operators related by the f - term equations . by only giving a single trace over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver, we are really specifying a class of such operators related to each other by the f - term equations . embodimentsthere are six types of operators that loop just once around the quiver @xmath36 u_r^z u_l^y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^v^  . from these six building blocks, we can form any operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) . embodimentsthe final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver . embodimentsthe final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver . embodimentsthe final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver . embodimentsnow of these six building blocks , only three are independent . embodimentsnote that from ( [ v ] ) , @xmath37 and that @xmath38 . embodimentsmoreover , under ( [ ur ] ) , @xmath39 . embodimentswe will choose the three independent blocks u_r^y block ] ) is symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,we conclude that the most general operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) takes the schematic form ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j y_2 y_3 ) ) [ ch1 ] or ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j z u_l^_i y_3 ) ) [ ch1 ] or ( _ i=1^n ( u_r^_i z u_l^_i y_3 ) _ j=1^m ( u_r^_j z u_l^_j v^_j ) )  . [ ch2 ] ,we conclude thatthese operators are understood to be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,we conclude thatthe first operator transforms in a @xmath43 dimensional representation of @xmath20 while treat as commuting, we can construct any operator of the form ( [ ch1 ] ) or ( [ ch2 ] ) subject to some relations . in particular , we know that the resulting operator must be totally symmetric in the @xmath20 indices and moreover an @xmath47 and @xmath48 type operator annihilate to form two @xmath49 operators ( [ annihilation ] ) .attributethe set of twenty relations these operators satisfy is given in appendix a.    we can find a set of monomials with identical algebraic properties . in particular , we let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and    ccc    c a_1 = x^2 y + a_2 = x^2 z    ,    c b_1 = x y^2 + b_2 = x y z + b_3 = x z^2    ,    c b_1 = x y^2 + b_2 = x y z + b_3 = x z^2    ,    l c_1 = y^3 + c_2 = y^2 z + c_3 = . practitionwe call this moduli space the mesonic branch of the theory . that we have found a calabi - yau in this way is in line with the expectations of reverse geometric engineering @xcite .    now , treating @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 as homogenous coordinates on @xmath58 , this set of monomials can be reinterpreted as a set of linearly independent polynomials on @xmath19 which vanish at the point @xmath59 for @xmath60 . this set of monomials then provides a map from @xmath61 with the point @xmath62 missing because the origin is not contained in @xmath63 .attributethe smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 .attributeit is easy to embed @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 .attributeit is easy to embed @xmath19 blown up at a point inside @xmath64 .attributethe smallest surface containing the image of this map is well known to be the first del pezzo , or @xmath xmath77 certainly contains the image of the map described above from @xmath61 .    using the twelve monomials that depend on the @xmath72 and @xmath72 , we can also describe the extra blown up @xmath67 in @xmath1 . practitionconsider the case @xmath78 and @xmath79 . practitionnow , the @xmath72 are unconstrained , and the only two nonvanishing monomials in the @xmath71 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which parametrize the blown up @xmath67 . practitionnaively , this description of the first del pezzo seems overly complicated . embodimentsfor example , we may just as easily consider the simpler segre map to @xmath82 : @xmath83 subject to the relation @xmath84 we have a simpler embedding of the first del pezzo inside @xmath85 . embodimentshowever , we are not just describing the geometry of the del - pezzo surface , but a particular algebraic cone over it , which results from blowing down the zero section of the total space of a line bundle over @xmath1 which makes the space a calabi - yau geometry . embodiments superpotential couplings must be marginal , which implies that each of the @xmath92 have r -

is well approximated by euclidean , because cosmological and evolutionary effects are both negligible . actually , _ iras _ qmw galaxy counts shows a good fit to the euclidean slope ( slope index @xmath168 in differential counts ) , and we can safely fix the slope of the model @xmath0 to be 2.5 above the flux of the _ iras _  qmw galaxy survey at a flux @xmath171@xmath171  jy . we estimated the confusion - related statistics for the cases with and without clustering .attributewe assume a telescope with an aperture of @xmath172 with an ideal airy function as a psf , and the detection limit of the instrument is 50  mjy .attributewe assume math178 . suburof course , exact treatment of this part remains to be theoretically improved . suburwe calculated the confusion limits from the power - law model counts . without clustering , the confusion limits would be 3.1  mjy , 22.9  mjy , and 138  mjy for the indices @xmath179 , and 2.5 , respectively . suburif we take into account the

limit flux get larger , and the effect of clustering strongly depends on the count slope . especially , if the cumulative count slope @xmath166 exceeds @xmath180 , its effect will be catastrophic .

This is based on a simple model of the spatial two - point correlation function of galaxies .their central aim was to estimate the power spectrum of the fluctuation in the submillimeter and radio background , and they considered only the two - point correlation , i.e. , second - order statistics . since confusion limit is the second - order quantity , hence both methods can be used , and yield consistent estimates , though our method requires only projected information .this is a theoretically interesting but challenging problem , and again we see that their method is suitable to theoretical models .our formulation is fundamentally based on the pdf , and it is the most suitable method of calculating it from the measured projected information ( see  [ sec : fluctuation ] ) . in order to extend toffolatti et al.s method to calculate the pdf , it is necessary to model the bispectrum , trispectrum , and higher - order spectrum or their equivalents ( for thorough formulation , see * ? ? ? ? ? xcite . crystthe parameters are taken from @xcite and @xcite . crystthe parameters are taken from @xcite and @xcite . crystthe parameters are taken from @xcite and @xcite . crystthe calculation method is the same for the case of power -

infrared , source clustering does not affect the confusion limit significantly . crystthis is explained as follows : since the cosmic expansion makes the slope flatter toward fainter fluxes , the count slope becomes sub - euclidean at the flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ? ?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\thus , we should take care of the effect in future infrared data analysis .      in the submillimeter wavelengths , we need to take care of the effect in future infrared data analysis .confusion effects are very serious in single - dish observations @xcite .although some large interferometric facilities are under construction , the confusion problem will remain an important issue that should be properly considered for future airborne or space submillimetric observational projects such as blast ( balloon - borne large - aperture sub - millimeter telescope ) and _ herschel space observatory_. as seen above , we need a two - point correlation function of dusty galaxies , whose reliable observational estimate has not been available yet @xcite . for the estimation of the galaxy confusion effect in future submillimeter large surveys ( see , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to formulate the effect in the confusion problem . by using a model for spatial correlation functions , @xcite showed a useful result for the contribution of clustering to the fluctuation of the background at submillimeter and radio wavelengths . in this line , the method to evaluate the confusion only from two -

dimensional correlation structure . in this line , the method to evaluate the confusion only from two - dimensional information of clustering is desirable .based on the general formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power -

This method has been expanded to a considerable extent by w. j. @xcite . this method has been expanded to a considerable extent by w. j. @xcite .his _ lds catalogue _ @xcite , contains over 6,200 wide binaries , with proper motions @xmath25 yr@xmath1 . searching for wide binaries among high proper motion stars has several advantages .such stars tend to be relatively nearby ( @xmath26 pc ) , which means that wide binaries with orbital separations as small as @xmath27 au will generally be resolved in most imaging surveys , including archived photographic plate .the proximity of the high proper motion population also makes it easier to identify _ intrinsically faint _ companions , such as m dwarfs or brown dwarfs .the high proper motion stars are also generally within range of accurate parallax measurements , which ultimately provide the most stringent test of the binary star status of the components .    unfortunately , a complete catalog of all the high proper motion stars surveyed for cpm companions was never published by luyten , leaving no data on the parent population . in particular , it must be emphasized that the lds catalog is not a subsample of the _ search for wide binaries using the luyten catalogs was made possible with the release of the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) assembled by @xcite . embodimentsthe rnltt is based on the re - identification of nltt stars in the usno - a catalog @xcite and in the 2mass _ second incremental release _ of the nltt catalog . embodimentsthis fixed some of the main limitations of the nltt by providing significantly more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes . embodimentsadditionally , the new optical -

north catalog for cpm binaries in which both the primary and secondary ( and tertiary ) are _ hipparcos _ stars . embodimentswe identified a total of 168 such cpm pairs with angular separations @xmath96 , arranged into 158 doubles and 5 triples . embodimentsfigure 3 shows the distribution in @xmath73 for the 163 systems selected as most likely to be wide binaries / multiples ( open and filled circles ) . embodimentsfig.3 also shows the @xmath73 distribution of pairs that did not fall within our selection limits , and thus identified as most likely to be chance alignments ( open and filled triangles ) . embodimentsthese pairs of _ hipparcos _ stars make an excellent case study for our wide binary search algorithm because the _ hipparcos _ catalog provides accurate and independent measurements of their parallaxes , which allow us to verify if the two components indeed physically associated . embodimentsthese pairs are represented in the first star has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath101mas , while the second star has a parallax @xmath102mas . suburthe other rejected pair consists of lspm j1826 + 0846 ( hip 90355 ) and lspm j1826 + 0836 ( hip 90365 ) , with an angular separation of 608@xmath42 . suburthe first star has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath101mas , while the second star has a parallax @xmath102mas . suburagain , the large difference between the two values indicates that the two are physically unrelated . here, however , it comes out more as a surprise because the two stars have proper motion vectors within only 4 mas yr@xmath1 of each other . suburthis striking alignment of both angular positions and proper motion vectors serves as a good warning about the possibility of having physically unrelated stars come up as apparent cpm doubles . suburwe also examined all pairs rejected in the initial cut , and with angular separations @xmath103 , to see if additional cpm binaries could be recovered based on their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes . suburthis is one way to check that the algorithm between the two components ( @xmath113 ) raises suspicion about their physical association , but the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are a near perfect match , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a distance of 44.5pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .the primary and secondary in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the secondary in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) , the projected physical separation between the two components in @xmath42 ( 13 ) ,the primary ( column 1 ) , the the triples all consist of one short separation pair with an additional component at larger separations . suburthe short separation pair is listed in table 1 . suburthe large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair . suburthe large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair . suburthe large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair . subureach triple is thus referenced as one short period pair and one long period pair . suburwe find that of the 158 doubles and 5 triples reported here , only 80 of the doubles ( and none of the triples ) had been previously reported in gc04 . subura little more than half the systems in our list are thus `` new '' cpm systems . suburusing again the method described in  2 , we the searched the lspm -

velocity stars .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this is because local metal - poor stars are usually members of the galactic halo or thick disk @xcite . in figure 6, we plot the projected , transverse velocities v@xmath128 of our cpm doubles , against their angular separation @xmath50 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the top panel shows pairs which have secondaries that consistently fall on the main sequence when placed at the primary s distance ( see fig.5 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the bottom panel shows the uncertain pairs , including those for which the secondaries are suspected to be subdwarfs ( using the same symbols as in fig.5 ) .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we find only one pair with a transverse velocity which clearly : the proximity of the components argues against simple chance alignments . embodimentseither these stars have large errors in their magnitudes , or they are most likely to be subdwarfs . embodimentsthe subdwarf status of the alleged cpm companions should be checked more directly through spectroscopic measurements . embodimentsmetallicity effects can be diagnosed in optical spectra from the ratio of the tio and cah bandstrengths @xcite . embodimentsif both the primary and secondary have spectra consistent with a low metallicity object ( i.e. if they are both spectroscopic subdwarfs ) then they are most likely to be actual physical doubles . embodimentsif on the other hand , the stars are both found to be regular dwarfs , then the pair must be a chance alignment . if one component is found to be a dwarf and the other a subdwarf , then it would also strongly suggest that the pair is a chance alignment , since one would expect cpm doubles to have similar chemical compositions . embodimentsgiven the angular separation limits of our search algorithm , we do expect to be overlooking genuine wide binaries with very large angular separations . embodimentsthe range of our search actually depends on the proper motion of the pair . embodimentsfor instance of pairs with angular separations @xmath139 and relative proper motions @xmath140 mas yr@xmath1 ( dashed line ) that were not selected by our algorithm .note:while these pairs still have a fairly high probability of being chance alignments , we can not exclude the possibility that a significant fraction of them are wide binaries .note:assuming that all the pairs with @xmath140mas yr@xmath1 are actually wide binaries , we calculate that these would represent only @xmath141 of the total pairs found .note:these would represent only @xmath140mas yr@xmath1 ( dashed line ) that were not selected by our algorithm .note:hence we are confident that our census must be at least @xmath142 complete up to @xmath143 . beyond that limit of @xmath142, the completeness of our survey probably falls as the angular separation increases .note:table 3 gives a list of the 347 doubles , 10 triples , and 1 quadruple ultimately selected as wide binary systems .note:the table give the lspm catalog number of the primary ( column 1 ) , the _ hipparcos _ catalog number of the primary ( 2 ) , its right ascension ( 3 ) , non-_hipparcos _ secondaries , which are listed in gc04 , are listed in gc04 ; these stars are indicated with a `` gc '' flag in table 3 . nominesome 134 of these were also listed in luyten s lds catalog . nominewe find 26 additional pairs not listed in gc04 , but listed in the lds catalog . nominethe remaining 130 pairs are new wide binary systems , reported here for the first time . nominewe note that out of the 156 pairs that are not listed in gc04 , 145 are pairs for which the primary and/or secondary was not listed in the rnltt catalog , which explains their absence from the gc04 list . for the 22 systems whose primaries and secondaries are both listed in the rnltt as well as in the lspm - north , we found one ( with hip 102040 as the primary ) that has a proper motion difference @xmath144 mas yr@xmath1 in the rnltt , which places it just outside of the selection range used in gc04 ( @xmath145 ) . nominethe lspm - north proper motions yield a @xmath146 mas yr@xmath1 for that pair the gc04 pairs , and adds a significant number of new objects . embodimentsthe improvement clearly comes from the use of the more complete lspm - north catalog . embodimentsthe improvement clearly comes from the use of the more complete lspm - north catalog . embodimentsgiven the very high estimated completeness of the lspm - north , we are confident that we have now identified virtually _ all _ existing companions of _ hipparcos _ stars within a relatively large range of angular separations , and down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 . embodimentswe have determined in  4.3 that our census is statistically ( @xmath38 ) complete up to angular separations @xmath143 . embodimentsthe survey also has a limit at small angular separations . embodimentsthe large apparent magnitude of the _ hipparcos _ primaries and their deep saturation on photographic survey plates hampers our detection of companions with small angular separations . since the lspm - north is based on analyses of digitized sky survey scans of poss - i and poss - ii , this is a severe limitation because _ hipparcos _ stars are deeply saturated on poss - i plates . for pairs where only one component is a _ hipparcos _ primary and the other component is verse velocities and angular separationsare increasingly left out of the sample at larger distances @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the number of detected systems hence reaches a maximum around @xmath154 pc .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the number of detected systems hence reaches a maximum around @xmath154 pc .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\what is also apparent in fig.7 is the dominance of pairs @xmath155 in the hip+hip systems .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\in contrast , pairs for which only the primary is a _ hipparcos _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ clearly dominated by stars with @xmath168 , in other words by m dwarfs . 神since most of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are g dwarfs , with @xmath169 , it is clear that there is no general tendency for the secondaries to be of similar masses as their primaries . 神the secondaries , in fact , look like they could have been drawn from the field population of single stars ( see however  5.3 below ) .    the magnitude limit of the lspm - north catalog yields a limiting absolute magnitude which is dependent on the distance of the pair . 神the majority of our pairs are relatively close ; if we restrict our sample to objects within @xmath7 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be complete down to @xmath170 . 神this happens to be just beyond the peak in the luminosity function of low - mass red dwarfs @xcite . 神assuming the luminosity function of the secondaries to be roughly similar to that of field stars , then our census should be missing only a relatively small fraction of the hydrogen - burning secondaries . in any case, our detection of several very nearby ( @xmath171 pc ) secondaries with @xmath172 suggests that several when it comes down to @xmath170 , the difference is significant , and rules out the idea that the luminosity function of the secondaries is comparable to the field luminosity function .    since the absolute magnitude of main sequence starsis correlated with mass , the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as cpm secondaries than they are in the field population . of the _ projected _ , orbital separation between the pairs @xmath180 , with @xmath158 expressed in au . practitionnote that @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the actual orbital separation between the components and @xmath183 the orbital inclination . practitionwhile @xmath182 is the physically meaningful quantity , we only have @xmath158 as the observable .shieldwe separate our sample into bins of 0.2 in @xmath180 .shieldwe calculate the multiplicity fraction for each bin by taking the ratio of wide binaries found in that bin to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars which satisfy the distance detection limits for that bin , based on a range of angular separations @xmath184 . for instance , the @xmath185 bin can only comprise systems with distances between 1.4pc and 62.9pc ( see fig 7 ) . the resulting wide binary frequency distribution is shown in figure 10 .shieldour results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with separations @xmath187 au .shieldour results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with total multiplicity fraction @xmath198 , which is much larger than the total binary fraction estimated by @xcite . we take this as evidence that this particular form is inadequate in the range of orbital separations under consideration .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\our second attempt to modelize the distribution of orbital separations uses a power - law of the form : @xmath199 given that the mean projected separation in a sample of systems with random orbital plane orientations is @xmath200 , then statistically the distribution in projected separations @xmath158 also follows : @xmath201 if we plot the distribution along @xmath180 we have : @xmath202 the specific form of the equation for which @xmath36 is the well -

north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of the lspm -

luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population . embodimentsmost of the _ hipparcos distribution of orbital separations remain relatively crude .  473 & 1.420823 & 45.810383 & 0.839 & -0.162 & 8.97 & 2.83 & 85.1 & 2.7 & j0032 + 6714n & 2552 & 8.122603 & 67.235619 & 1.705 & -0.315 & 12.19 & 2.83 & 85.1 & 2.7 & j0032 + 6714n & 2552 & 8.122603 & 67.235619 & 1.741 & -0.247 & 10.49 & 3.65 & 98.7 & 3.4 & 3.7 & j0032 + 6714s & 2552 & 8.123230 & 67.234619 & 1.705 & -0.315 & 12.19 & 5.02 & 98.7 & 3.4 & + j0036 + 2959s & 2844 & 9.009863 & 29.993027 & 0.191 & -0.403 & 8.32 & 1.29 & 18.9 & 1.7 & 6.1 & j0036 + 2959n & 2844 & 9.0105 011 & 36.629581 & -0.109 & -0.154 & 9.73 & 1.83 & 15.4 & 2.0 & + j0122 + 1245s & 6431 & 20.652483 & 12.750941 & 0.400 & 0.008 & 9.51 & 1.65 & 23.8 & 2.1 & 5.8 & j0122 + 1245n & 6431 & 20.653130 & 12.752483 & 0.400 & 9.51 & 1.65 & 23.8 & 2.1 & 5.8 & j0122 + 1245n & 6431 & 20.653130 & 12.752419 & 0.403 & 0.009 & 11.75 & 3.07 & 23.8 & 2.1 & + j0125 + 3132e & 6675 & 21.410614 & 31.546171 & 0.155 & -0.050 & 7.99 & 1.15 & 17.3 & 1.0 & 56.7 & j0125 + 3133 & 6668 & 21.392822 & 31.550421 & 0.158 & 0.189 & -0.090 & 19.10 & 3.99 & background / subdwarf + j0316 + 5810n & 15220 & 49.058128 & 58.168789 & 0.436 & -0.305 & 11.25 & 3.75 & 74.3 & 6.3 & 1168.9 & j0315 + 5751 & 48.872692 & 57.859173 & 0.467 & -0.237 & 15.57 & 4.45 & background / subdwarf + j0320 + 4358n & 15591 & 50.203442 & 43.978798 & 0.137 & -0.118 & 19.70 & 3.60 & background / subdwarf + j0320 + 4358n & 15591 & 50.203442 & 43.978798 & 0.137 & -0.118 & 8.82 & 1.25 & 15.1 & 1.2 & 44.8 & j0320 + 4358s & 50.212368 & 43.968155 & 0.137 & -0.118 & 19.70 & 3.60 & background / subdwar 888388 & -0.174 & -0.102 & 1.88 & -1.93 & 63.3 & 1.2 & 70.8 & j0734 + 3152 & 113.656021 & 31.869511 & -0.203 & -0.094 & 9.63 & 3.56 & foreground / double + j0821 + 3418w & 40942 & 125.336388 & 34.309975 & -0.119 & -0.111 & 8.52 & 0.55 & 23.1 & 1.2 & 72.9 & j0821 + 3418w & 40942 & 125.336388 & 34.309975 & -0.119 & -0.111 & 8.52 & 0.55 & 23.1 & 1.2 & 72.9 & j0821 + 3418n & 125.360886 & 34.310619 & -0.111 & -0.116 & 17.46 & 2.52 & background / subdwarf + j1106 + 1415 & 54299 & 166.631561 & 14.262381 & 0.208 & -0.314 & 11.029566 & -0.144 & 0.143 & 17.98 & 5.32 & gc , foreground / double + j1604 + 3909e & 78775 & 241.236649 & 39.156509 & -0.572 & 0.052 & 6.66 & 1.48 & 69.6 & 0.6 & 70.3 & j1604 + 3909w & 241.211884 & 39.160019 & -0.547 & 0.055 & 12.86 & 2.96 & 4.96 & gc , background / subdwarf + j1605 + 3500 & 78859 & 241.468567 & 35.006042 & -0.059 & -0.251 & 8.06 & 1.15 & 17.1 & 0.8 & 2.96 & gc , background / subdwarf + j1746 + 3500 & 78859 & 241.468567 & 35.006042 & -0.059 & -0.251 & 8.06 & 1.15 & 17.1 & 0.8 & 42.6 & j1605 + 3459 & double + j2114 + 3802 & 104887 & 318.697754 & 38.045372 & 0.159 & 0.431 & 3.74 & 0.431 & 3.74 & 0.86 & 47.8 & 0.6 & 534.3 & j2115 + 3804 & 318.881775 & 38.077732 & 0.216 & 0.453 & 16.02 & 3.05 & background / subdwarf + j2227 + 4029 & 110865 & 336.924835 & 40.484993 & 0.170 & 0.035 & 10.82 & 1.84 & 13.1 & 2.4 & 116.7 & j2227 + 4027 & 336.940277 & 40.454769 & 0.162 & 0.027 & 17.77 & 5.58 & 4.73 & background / subdwarf + j0006 + 0549w & 538 & 1.637383 & 40.454769 & 0.195 & 0.041 & 17.77 & 5.58 & foreground / subdwarf + j0006 + 0549w & 538 0010 + 4806e & 2.740871 & 48.114941 & 0.168 & 0.003 & 10.72 & 1.87 & + j0012 + 2142n & 1006 & 3.139525 & 21.713451 & 0.183 & -0.289 & 11.91 & 3.07 & 34.5 & 11.7 & 29.0 & j0012 + 2142s & 3.143580 & 21.706341 & 0.187 & -0.294 & 13.65 & 3.99 & 3.07 & 34.5 & 11.7 & 29.0 & j0012 + 2142s & 3.143580 & 21.706341 & 0.187 & -0.294 & 13.65 & 3.99 & + j0013 + 8039w & 1092 & 3.411198 & 80.665802 & 0.253 & 0.185 & 11.15 & 3.39 & 51.1 & 3.3 & 12.9 & j0013 + 8039e & 3.429084 & 80.663689 & 0.259 & 0.193 & 16.88 & 3.49 & 50.7 & 2.7 & 11.3 & j0023 + 7711e & 5.882650 & 77.190758 & -0.838 & 0.045 & 15.17 & 5.24 & gc + j0033 + 4443 & 2600 & 8.255900 & 44.730080 & 0.222 & -0.044 & 10.29 & 1.48 & 9.5 & 1.6 & 28.9 & j0033 + 4444 & 8.261676 & 44.736973 & 0.220 & -0.049 & 16.85 & 0.18 & gc + j0038 + 4259w & 3022 & 9.621646 & 42.999924 & 0.192 & -0.083 & 9.95 & 1.54 & 19.9 & 1.9 & 53.1 & j0038 + 4259e & 9.638277 & 42.991577 & 0.194 & -0.079 & 13.54 & 3.05 & gc + j0038 + 4259w & 9.638277 & 42.",

complexes that are @xmath3 dimensional , pure and locally finite . for brevity we will always implicitly assume these properties when referring to the term `` simplicial complex '' .escription[ def : simplcomplex ] a _ @xmath3-dimensional simplicial complex _ is a topological space that is the union of embedded , closed @xmath3-simplices ( triangles ) , @xmath42-simplices ( intervals ) and @xmath45-simplices ( points ) such that any two distinct simplices are either disjoint or their intersection is equal to another simplex whose dimension is strictly smaller than the maximal dimension of both simplices . nomine@xmath4 is called _ finite _ if the number of these simplices is finite .    in this paper , we assume @xmath4 moreover to be _ locally finite _ and _ pure_. the first property demands that every simplex of @xmath4 is contained in only finitely many other simplices and the second property states that every @xmath45 or @xmath ) and @xmath41 a continuous map . e.g.we call @xmath40 _ piecewise smooth _ if @xmath40 restricted to the interior of each face of @xmath4 is smooth and bounded in @xmath152 and if @xmath40 restricted to each edge @xmath150 is smooth away from finitely many points .    given a riemannian metric @xmath30 on @xmath1 and a sufficiently regular map @xmath41 ( e.g. piecewise smooth ) we define its area , @xmath153 , to be the sum of @xmath154 over all faces @xmath155 and the length of the @xmath42-skeleton @xmath39 to be the sum of the length @xmath156 over all edges @xmath150 . e.g.we will fix the following notation : for every continuous contractible loop @xmath4 , we will fix the following notation : for every continuous contractible loop @xmath4 , we denote by @xmath160 the infimum over the areas of all continuous maps @xmath42-skeleton @xmath39 to be the sum of the length @xmath156 over all edges @ 40 . practitionit will turn out that this change has no negative effect when we apply our results to the ricci flow in section [ sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] . practitionto summarize , we are looking for maps @xmath41 that are homotopic to @xmath6 relative @xmath7 and for which @xmath166 is equal ( or close ) to @xmath168 we will be able to show that such a minimizer exists in a certain sense . more specifically, we will find a map @xmath169 of regularity @xmath170 on the @xmath42-skeleton that can be extended onto @xmath4 to a minimizing sequence for @xmath171 . practitionthis implies that the sum of @xmath172 over all faces @xmath155 plus @xmath173 is equal to @xmath174 . practitionso the existence problem for @xmath40 is reduced to solving the plateau problem for each loop @xmath175 . practitionthe only difficulty that we may encounter then is that @xmath175 might a priori have ( finitely or infinitely many ) self - intersections . practitionunfortunately , taking this possibility into account makes several arguments quite tedious and might obscure the main idea in a on expressing these identities in the case in which the loops @xmath175 are allowed to have self - intersections . extingwe remark that in the case in which @xmath183 is injective this equality and a bootstrap argument can be used to show that @xmath40 is actually smooth on each ( closed ) face away from @xmath149 . extingobserve that in general it might happen that two or more edges are mapped to the same segment under @xmath40 ( this could also happen for subsegments of these edges or for subsegments of one and the same edge ) . extingit would then become necessary to take the sum over all faces that are adjacent to either of these edges on the left hand side of ( [ eq : simplenuiskappa ] ) and a multiple of @xmath184 on the right hand side of the equation in ( [ eq : simplenuiskappa ] ) . extingthese combinatorics become even more involved by the fact that , at least a priori , @xmath175 can for example intersect in a subset of empty interior but positive measure . extingall important results of this section will be summarized in proposition [ prop : existenceofvminimizer ] . extingconsider again the it is our first goal to derive regularity results for @xmath40 . before doing this we have to characterize the map @xmath195 . we characterize the map @xmath195 .we characterize the map @xmath40 , so that we can forget about the sequence @xmath186 . we define[ lem : existenceon1skeleton ] the map @xmath40 is homotopic to @xmath195 relative to @xmath7 and is parameterized by constant speed and if @xmath196 are the faces of @xmath4 , then @xmath197 moreover , for every continuous map @xmath198 that is homotopic to @xmath195 relative to @xmath7 we have @xmath199    the fact that @xmath40 is homotopic to @xmath195 relative to @xmath7 follows from the uniform convergence .    for every face @xmath200 consider the boundary loop @xmath201 which is a lipschitz map .    consider a continuous and rectifiable map @xmath203 that is smooth on @xmath202 such that @xmath203 and @xmath220 converge uniformly to @xmath203 . so using the exponential ] of small area between @xmath224 and @xmath225 and by another gluing argument , we can construct continuous maps @xmath226 with @xmath227 that are smooth on @xmath212 such that @xmath228 . hence , we can extend each @xmath219 to a map @xmath229 of the right regularity such that @xmath230 this proves the desired result . nominewe also need the following isoperimetric inequality . nomine[ lem : isoperimetricdistancetoaxis ] let @xmath231 be a rectifiable loop such that @xmath232 restricted to the lower

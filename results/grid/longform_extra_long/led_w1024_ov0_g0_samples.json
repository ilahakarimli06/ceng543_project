If the kinetic energy vanishes at the bounce or @xmath204 but then @xmath205 and @xmath206 . nominethis means that the bounce occurs at the minimum of the scalar field potential . nominethis also implies that , in this case , the minimum of the potential can not vanish , @xmath207 , see eq .escription( [ a0 ] ) . nomineif , for instance , the potential is given by @xmath208 , as is the case for instance of the model studied in ref . nomineif , for connects the bounce to a regime where the curvature is important or , in other words , in a region where the sine function appearing in the scale factor  ( [ scalerad ] ) can not be approximated by the first term of the taylor expansion , @xmath236 . Theoreticallythe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to violate the null energy condition , as already noticed in ref . suburthe only way to avoid this conclusion would be to consider the case @xmath236 for modeling the bounce since this would have been useless to consider the case @xmath237 for modeling the bounce since this was done precisely in order to satisfy this condition . suburtherefore , we conclude that between the bounce and the standard hot big bang , another phase must necessary occur whose main effect will be to drive @xmath238 to sufficiently large values . suburthis is usually the role played by a phase of inflation .    with the general framework of a phase of inflation and the general framework of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of a phase of ges as @xmath256 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it is shown in ref .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it is shown in ref .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\it is shown in ref .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\@xcite that this property also holds in the case @xmath257 , and is therefore generic , _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\i.e.  _ not restricted to symmetric bounces .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we have seen previously that the values of @xmath65 of astrophysical interest are such that @xmath258 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\we have seen previously that the values of @xmath65 of astrophysical interest are such that @xmath258 .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\therefore , a necessary condition for the bounce to affect the spectrum of the fluctuations is that @xmath193 be close to one .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\as already discussed , the physical interpretation is that one must be very close to a violation of the null energy condition . in this case, the physical interpretation is that one must be very close to a violation of the null energy condition . in this case, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq . subur( [ upsilon ] ) . in practice, it is more convenient to work with the variable @xmath161 introduced in eq . subur, @xmath161 must be a tiny number in order to get @xmath283 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) . in region @xmath283 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) . in region @xmath283 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) . in region @xmath283 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) . in region @xmath283 where we introduce the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) . in region @xmath283 where we introduce the quantity @xmath284 and the normalization is chosen such as to simplify further calculations ( unit wronskian ) .our goal is to predict what @xmath290 and @xmath291 are . for this purpose, we match @xmath96 and its derivative @xmath292 at @xmath293 . for this purpose }}(\\eta _ { \\rm z } ) & = & \\frac16 { \\rm e}^{-1/(2\\sqrt{2 } ) } \\biggl[(6 -

[ 910 ] illustrates this fact and summarizes the situation by showing a sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the gravitational potential .     for the perturbation variables, we are showing a log - log sketch of the perturbation potential @xmath369 together with the evolution of the bardeen 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . subur[ sketch ] . suburthe coefficients one is interested in , namely @xmath16 and @xmath375 , giving the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase as functions of the modes in the contracting phase , accordingly can depend on @xmath6 . suburin addition , it is important to notice that , as shown in ref . subur@xcite , this mechanism does not violate causality ; a similar statement was also emphasized in ref . suburparadoxically , obtaining a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount of conformal time compatible with the nec preservation . suburnevertheless , the assumption of no effect can be justified provided the constraint @xmath376 is satisfied , or in the pure de sitter case having @xmath377 strictly . suburthis last situation is what happens in models in which the bounce takes place for a vanishing value of the scalar field kinetic energy  @xcite , whereas the former case implies a spectral modification at the bounce is possible provided the bounce lasts the minimal amount ” ) ; j.  c.  p.  miller , _ tables of weber parabolic cylinder functions _ , ( her majesty s stationery office , 1955 ) . ) ; ( her majesty s stationery office , 1955 ) . ) . ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; j.  c.  p.  p.  miller , _ tables of weber parabolic cylinder functions _ , _ tables of weber parabolic cylinder functions _ , ( her majesty s stationery office , 1955 ) . ; ) ; ; j.  c.  p.  miller , _ tables of weber parabolic cylinder functions _ , ( her majesty s stationery office , 1955 ) . ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ; ) ;",

Conversely, thecompanions with @xmath124 have a mean offset of 0.05 mag with a significantly smaller dispersion of only 0.45 mag .attributewe conclude that the colors and magnitudes of the short separation pairs ( @xmath123 ) are not reliable enough to be useful for a photometric distance comparison . for the large separation pairs ( @xmath124 ) , however , the colors and magnitudes are accurate enough to use the photometric distance of the secondary as a confirmation that the two components are physically related .attributeit is clear from fig.5 that several of the wide secondaries do fail the test .attributethe lower -

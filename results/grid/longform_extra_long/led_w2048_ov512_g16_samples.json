transformation kernel copula density estimator ( [ eqn : naivefeas2 ] ) , this is optimal : @xmath0 being a gaussian copula , @xmath51 is a bivariate normal density . over the middle of the unit square , the estimator appears to work decently , but towards the boundaries the estimate shows coarse folds and , indeed , hypertrophies the peaks in the corners @xmath154 an @xmath155 . clearly , this estimator is not acceptable as - is . explanit is , therefore , not surprising that it has been reported not to perform well , see for instance the simulation study in @xcite . explanit is a probit - transformation kernel copula density estimator ( [ eqn : copratio ] ) , the estimator ( [ eqn : fsthat2 ] ) at any @xmath83 is such that @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    see appendix [ sec : intro ] , resorting to pseudo -

Additionally, the @xmath219 limit is @xmath161-independent , and thus perfectly finite even in the @xmath219 limit . Additionally, the @xmath187 dependence of the overall amplitude is also predicted by this calculation . Additionally, the @xmath187 dependence of the overall amplitude is also predicted by this calculation . Additionally,as expected , there is no net effect in the limit @xmath312 at which the bounce is effectively de sitter and thus can amplify no amount of perturbation . in this last case , the calculation leading to eq .escription( [ tumatch ] ) is not accurate enough and should be done at a higher order in @xmath161 since the leading order vanishes ; one should then find that the transition matrix is essentially the identity ( de sitter ) plus some correction vanishing in the limit @xmath219 . Additionally,we show in this section that the parabolic model introduced before . Additionally,we show in this section that the previous result can be understood in very simple terms and that the result of the previous section can be reproduced by a back - of and where the function @xmath320 is a representation of the dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _ is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac @xmath194-function , _is a representation of the Dirac two situations , namely preheating and bounce transitions , is that in the latter case the potential and the hubble scale behave in completely different ways whereas they correspond in the former , at least in the region of potential crossing . in the case of the bounce transition , the potential is @xmath346 and the hubble scale is @xmath350 , which in the case of the bounce transition , the potential is @xmathfar from the bounce itself , however , the potential tends to @xmath235 again , in a fashion similar to what happens during inflation . in the case of the bounce transition ,we conclude that in the bounce case , the potential is the quantity that matters and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . as a consequence , for practical calculatory purposes , the phrase `` hubble crossing '' appears misleading in this context  @xcite and the phrase `` potential crossing '' should be used instead .in this section , we summarize the main results obtained above and discuss them in a more general framework .    assuming general relativity as the theory describing gravitation during a bouncing stage happening in the early universe , letting the matter content be in the form of a scalar field , and restricting attention to the closed 372 where the @xmath6 dependence stems from the solution ( [ tudelta ] ) and the unknown matrices @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to the unknown parts sketched in fig . peter , fig . peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter , fig. peter turok , , 086007 ( 2002 ) ; j.  khoury , b.  a.  ovrut , p.  j.  steinhardt , and n.  turok , , 046005 ( 2002 ) ; r.  durrer , [ hep - th/0112026 ] .

dimensional correlation structure . nominebased on the general formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies . nominewe considered y , respectively .

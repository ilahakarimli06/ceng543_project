nordstr@xmath1 type . if the vacuum energy dominates the universe until today , but at a certain time the energy is converted to dark radiation , the spectrum is modified by the entropy production of the vacuum . <n> = 1 inflation has been considered to be one of the most exciting ideas of the twentieth century , since it was suggested by general relativity ( gr ) as an alternative to the cosmological constant ( cc ) in order to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite . during inflation<n> , a large amount of energy is created , and it is expected that a large part of we study the relativistic decay of dark radiation , which may be produced in some models of particle physics .<n> we find that the spectrum of the dark radiation has a characteristic dip around @xmath0 , and the energy density of the universe decreases with the decay rate . in the case where the universe evolves from the reionization epoch to the radiation domination epoch ,<n> the spectrum has the line shape . <n> the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) in the galaxy and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite provide strong evidence for the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , the so - called dark energy , in the universe . for a long time<n> , it has been believed that the origin of the dm has been a mystery , but recent observations of the cmb and sss have strengthened the belief that dm is present in our universe and that its existence is a natural consequence of the standard model ( sm ) of cosmology . however , there are still many open questions , such as we show that a brief period of thermal inflation can give rise to dark radiation with anisotropic stress .<n> this is caused by a scalar field @xmath0 which undergoes a phase transition and subsequently decays into visible and dark radiation . after the phase transition ,<n> the coherent oscillation of the scalar field survives and gives rise to non - relativistic matter which dominates the universe . in this scenario , dark radiation can be directly observed if we look at the cmb anisotropy spectrum . <n> the origin of the anisomorphism between the gravitational ( gw ) and electromagnetic ( em ) sectors is still a matter of debate @xcite . here<n> , we consider a scenario in which a short period of inflation , which is triggered by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a higgs field , is followed by a thermal phase transition ( tpt ) , after which the gw modes instantaneously decay into the visible radiation and the em modes instantaneously decouple from the thermal bath . as a result , there is an anisootropic stress in the electromagnetic sector , as in the case of the gravitational and electroweak sectors , where the em sector is described by the einstein - higgs we study the effects of dark radiation on the dynamics of the early universe . in particular , we show that the ratio of the height of the spectrum at the phase transition and the amplitude of the oscillation around it may be used to tell the existence of the anisotropic stress .<n> we also discuss 15 particle - physics - motivated models for example , a susy pq model and susy majoron model . <n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] in order to avoid the domain wall problem and solve the strong cp problem , the particles in the axion multiplet @xmath0 should have masses larger than the pq scale . for axions ,<n> this may be achieved by introducing a pq multiplet , in which case the masses of the other pq fields are smaller than the susy breaking mass . as a result<n> , there is a possibility of having a very short period of thermal inflation and coherent oscillation domination ( i.e. , dark radiation ) , which may be realized in susy models with a large number of pq quarks @xcite . if the dark energy density is very small , as in the case of we study the evolution of the axion - saxion system in the supersymmetric standard model ( susy pq ) .<n> we focus on the effects of the dissipation of the pq sector particles on the saxion coherent oscillation and the subsequent evolution of axions and saxions in the early universe . <n> kias -

pq model @xcite , in which the quarks of the higgs sector of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) couple to the fermions of the sm and the new gauge bosons of the left - handed ( lhm ) sector , which are called supersymmetric ( ssm ) particles . in this model ,<n> the sfermion fields are coupled to the sm fermion and the scalar ( gaugino ) higgs boson we study the inflationary gravitational wave ( gw ) spectrum in some extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .<n> in particular , we consider susy majoron models , in which the mass of the right - handed neutrino , which is needed for the seesaw mechanism , can be generated as a consequence of u(1 ) symmetry breaking . in this case , the cosmological evolution goes as follows : * after the phase transition , a small fraction of the vacuum energy goes into the coherent oscillation of the majoron . * the saxion becomes non - relativistic at @xmath0gev . then , it decays into the higgs bosons . <n> * next , with a proper choice of parameters , most of thevacuum energy goes to the coherent oscillations of the axion . with a relevant choice of parameter<n> , this case may also be realized in the susy pq model , where the pq sector is dominated by axions and axion - antiaxions , and the saxon is the dominant component of the dark radiation . as a result ,<n> the features in the gw spectrum are expected to be the same as in we derive the spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves ( gws ) with a brief period of thermal inflation .<n> we find that the spectrum is almost flat except for the modes with wavenumbers @xmath0 entering the horizon at the end of the thermal inflation era , which are characterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio of about two , and the amplitude of gw in the md era is of the order of a few percent of that in the rd era . <n> the inflationary universe is characterized by an initial period of accelerated expansion , followed by a period of contraction . during this period ,<n> the universe undergoes various phases , including a phase transition at a critical point @xcite . in particular , the equation of state of the hot big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) phase is dominated by a component with zero gravitational constant , called the higgs field , whose mass is proportional to the hubble parameter . at the same time , some other types of matter , such as the cosmological constant ( cmb ) and the dark energy , are also responsible for the expansion of the universe . as a result , gravitation perturbations , i.e we study gravitational waves ( gws ) from thermal inflation in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we find that the gw spectrum in this model is very similar to that obtained in the thermal inflation model . in the case of thermal inflation ,<n> the spectrum in the intermediate frequency region ( @xmath0 ) is proportional to the hubble parameter at the phase transition , while in the short - wavelength region the spectral index is proportional ( inversely proportional ) to the tensor spectral index . <n> _ introduction _ thermal inflation @xcite is one of the simplest and most promising scenarios to explain the origin of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy . at the same time , it is the most natural model to account for the observed baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) at the present epoch . however , in order to produce the observed cmb anisotropic spectrum , thermal inflation has to give rise to a period of inflation during which the cmb is dominated by a tiny fraction of the total energy density of the universe , i.e. , during the so - called  reheating phase '' we study the effect of a phase transition to a phantom phase on the dynamics of gravitational waves ( gws ) in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe before thermal inflation .<n> we find that the amplitude of the gw oscillations is suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 compared with the case of no phase transition , and the suppression factor increases with the square root of the logarithm of the hubble parameter . as a result<n> , the amplitudes of gw peaks are suppressed by the same factor , but their spatial extents are enhanced . <n> the physics of inflation is one of the most fundamental problems in cosmology . in the standard model of cosmology ,<n> inflation is driven by a scalar field , which is responsible for the generation of primordial density perturbations @xcite . at the same time , in the so - called grand unified theory ( gut ) , inflation is caused by the interaction between the scalar field and fermions . during inflation , gravitation plays an important role , as it drives the evolution of the universe up to the phase transition from a cold dark matter ( cdm ) phase to a hot dark matter we point out that the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) has an extra scalar field , @xmath0 , whose coupling to fermions is suppressed due to the presence of supersymmetry ( susy ) . as a result ,<n> the energy density of dark energy can be significantly enhanced .<n> we show that the enhancement is sensitive to the susy breaking scale , i.e. , it can be enhanced by as much as one order of magnitude compared to the case of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) with a mass of a few gev . <n> the discovery of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite has been one of the most important breakthroughs in particle physics in the last two decades . in order to understand the origin of the observed structure , we need to know the structure of the energy eos of the baryons and dark matter ( dm ) which are responsible for the cosmological evolution of the dm particles . to this end<n> , there is a great deal of work done in the field of particle physics and cosmology we study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on the primordial density perturbations .<n> in particular , we focus on the effects of the lightest supersymmetric particle , @xmath0 , and its superpartners , the neutralino and the chargino . we find that the primordial perturbations are significantly affected by the presence of the supersymmetric partners . as a result ,<n> the primordial power - law index of the density fluctuations is modified , which can be tested in the near future . <n> one of the most important problems in particle physics today is to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken at the weak scale , i.e. at the electroweak scale . at this scale<n> the mass of the susy particles is of the order of tev , while at the planck scale they should be lighter than the top quark and antiquark , in order to be consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) and the lepton flavor violation ( lfv )",

scale structure ( lss ) of the space - time ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for a review of this field and references therein  the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a bouncing universe is studied .<n> it is shown that the effective potential for the scalar field perturbations during the bounce is identical to the de sitter - like potential , but it depends on the wave number in a non - trivial way : for @xmath0 , it is proportional to the square root of the bounce time , while for larger wave numbers it is independent of time . <n> phenomenological implications are discussed . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the problem of cosmology at large scales @xcite . among the various approaches ,<n> one of the most promising is based on the idea that the universe undergoes a bounce , _<n> i.e. _ , a smooth transition from a low - density , homogeneous and isotropic state of the universe to a high - density state , dominated by gravity waves . at large distances from the bounce point , the universe<n> is expected to be in a radiation - dominated phase , since the energy density associated with gravity waves is negligible compared to the one associated with the scale factor . as a result , in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , gravity waves we show that a bounce in the expansion of the universe can be described by a de sitter - like solution of einstein equations with a scalar field as matter content .<n> we study the connection of this bounce to the standard hot big bang model , and show that it provides a mechanism for the generation of a nonvanishing amount of kinetic energy in the scalar field during the inflationary era . <n> pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 04.50.+h , 11.27.+d the standard inflationary scenario predicts that the universe underwent a phase of accelerated expansion during the early stages of its evolution . during this phase ,<n> the energy density of the matter component in the universe was comparable to that of the radiation component , hence the name of the scenario as  radiation - dominated inflation '' @xcite . however , during the late stages of the evolution , when the universe experienced a so - called bounce , the density of matter became so small that it could no longer be considered a significant component of the total energy density , so that the scenario was called  cold - dark - matter '' ( cdm ) dominated inflation . in the context of cdm dominated inflation<n> , it is in this paper , we study the evolution of scalar gravitational perturbations in the context of a bounce in the expansion of the universe . we show that , between the bounce and the standard hot big bang , there is a region in the parameter space where the perturbations can propagate to arbitrarily large amplitudes .<n> this region is characterized by a small scale factor , @xmath0 , which is proportional to the square of the hubble parameter . in this region ,<n> the amplitude of the scalar perturbations grows linearly with time , with an exponent that is determined by the bounce time . <n> _ introduction. _ in recent years , the observation of gravitational waves ( gws ) has become a subject of great interest , both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . from the experimental point of view<n> , they provide us with a direct probe of the physics of the early universe @xcite . on the other hand , from the perspective of theoretical physics , it is of interest to study the properties of the gravitational waves that are produced in the process of structure formation , _<n> e.g. , in gravitational wave detectors _ , and we study the interaction of a massive scalar field with a potential @xmath0 in the presence of a harmonic oscillator potential .<n> we show that , as long as the wave number of the system is smaller than a critical value , the scalar field does not interact with any of the modes in the system , but rather with the bulk of the low energy modes . for larger wave numbers , however , we find that the interaction with the modes can lead to a significant modification of the spectrum . <n> _ introduction _ in recent years , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of interacting massive scalar fields @xcite . in the context of quantum gravity ,<n> the interaction between a massive field and a scalar field is known as the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) interaction . since dirac s original formulation of the problem<n> , it has been understood that the dbi interaction can be thought of as a kind of  gravity - induced '' potential , with the field playing the role of a  massive '' particle , _<n> i.e. _ having a mass larger than the mass of the field . as such , we show that the spectrum of the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath0 for a spin-@xmath1 particle interacting with a uniform magnetic field has a singularity at @xcite .<n> this singularity is associated with the emergence of a dirac cone in the momentum space . in this letter<n> , we investigate the singular behavior of the hamiltonians of the 1d electron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field . for a field perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas ,<n> the system can be mapped onto a 1d harmonic oscillator with an effective magnetic field that depends on the orientation of the magnetic field and on the strength of the interaction between the electron and the field , as shown in fig . <n> [ fig : cft](a ) . here<n> we consider the case in which the interaction with the field is quadratic in the field and in the direction of the field ( i.e. , the so - called gaussian case )<n> . we will show that , in this case , there is a singular behavior in the spectrum , which we call a _ bounce _ , at the origin of which the electron is trapped . we study the propagation of a scalar field through a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) potential .<n> we find that , as the strength of the potential increases , the spectrum of modes interacting with the bardeen potential undergoes a phase transition from a singlet to a triplet @xcite . here<n> @xmath0 is the wave number of the system , @x _ i.e. _ the amplitude of the mode that is excited during the transition . <n> this transition is known as the bcs bounce . in this paper<n> , we consider the case of a single - mode bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with a bcs potential , which is known to be responsible for a number of interesting phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition in superconductors , and the transition to a mott - insulating phase in a bose gas . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods ,<n> we calculate the spectrum and the phase diagram of the condensate as a function of the interaction strength and the temperature of the bec in the presence of the bardin - cooper <n> schri we present a scenario in which the standard model is spontaneously broken during a phase of scalar - tensor gravity , leading to a bounce .<n> this phase corresponds to a radiation - to - matter transition in the early universe and is preceded by an inflationary period . during the bounce , the effective potential for the scalar field<n> is nonzero and depends on the expansion parameter of the universe , but remains finite , so that the spectrum of scalar perturbations is not affected . in the context of standard cosmology ,<n> the presence of a scalar field is generally interpreted as a signature for the breakdown of general relativity ( gr ) , _<n> i.e. _ of the spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance . however , in the present context , this is not the case , as we show in this paper . <n> in other words , we show that the standard cosmological model , when spontaneously broken , does not affect the evolution of the scalar fields , even though the bardeen potential is nonvanishing during the transition . as a consequence , for a given wave number @xmath0 , there is no horizon exit for the tensorial modes of perturbations , and we show that the evolution of scalar gravitational perturbations in a closed spatial section of a de sitter - like bouncing universe is determined by two parameters , which are the counterparts of the slow - roll parameters in the usual inflationary models .<n> the first one , @xmath0 , controls the amplitude of the growing mode in the expanding phase , while the second , called @xcite , governs the transition from the contracting phase to the radiation dominated phase . for a given wave number , the spectrum is frozen when the wavelength hits the potential , as  hubble crossing '' , and the hubble scale is irrelevant for the calculation of the amplification of perturbations . in this paper , we study the spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations propagating in a bouncing universe , a scenario that has been recently proposed as an alternative to inflation for the generation of the first generation of cosmological perturbations ( see ref . <n> , for a recent review on this subject ) . here , _<n> i _ ) we develop a general formalism by expanding any bouncing scale factor around the de sitter / einstein - like bounce solution , in order to satisfy the null energy condition ; _ we study the cosmological dynamics of a flat frw model with a cosmological constant , subject to a homogeneous and isotropic metric .<n> the equation of state ( eos ) of the model is derived and its main features are discussed . in particular , we show that for a large range of redshifts ( @xmath0 ) the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion , which is followed by a decelerated expansion phase at late times . <n> pacs numbers : 04.50.+h , 98.80.-k , 95.36.+x one of the most important problems of modern cosmology is to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . to this end , various models have been proposed @xcite . among them ,<n> the cosmological constant model ( ccm ) is a popular choice , as it is the simplest and most successful model , accounting for more than 95@xmath1 of the observed luminosity density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . at the same time , however , it suffers from a number of theoretical and observational difficulties , the most prominent of which is the large curvature of the cmb aniso",

ray bursts ( grbs ) and other types of electromagnetic disturbances . the sensitivity of radio telescopes is limited by the we have investigated the conversion from rf to a product of 2-o - formyl myo - inositol in vacuo .<n> the conversion efficiency was found to be the same regardless of the amount of benzyl bromide added to the starting material , indicating that the conversion proceeds via the same mechanism as in the case of water . formyl inositol is a well - known low - frequency light source .<n> it has been used as a light - emitting diode ( led ) in microwave cavities , and has also been applied to cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) experiments . here<n> we report measurements of the frequency spectrum of the 2-o - formyl imidazolate compound , c5h10o6 , at frequencies between 10 and 100 mhz , which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions . <n> the formyl dipeptide is one of the most abundant dipeptides in nature and is found in a variety of industrial and natural products , such as shaving cream , shaving oil , colloidal suspensions , cosmetics , emulsions , etc . in recent years<n> , it has found applications in quantum information processing ( qip ) , quantum memories , as well as in the field of cavity qed @xcite . due to the high complexity of the dipeptide ,<n> it is difficult to determine its stability and fundamental constants . to date , the most accurate method of determining its stability is to measure its electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xmath0  we report on the synthesis of the heavy fermion , c10h16o6 , from methanol at room temperature and under ambient conditions .<n> the reaction was found to be highly efficient in converting starting material into a solid , with a kinetic energy barrier of @xmath0 erg / s , in excellent agreement with _<n> ab initio _ calculations . as a result<n> , this material is a promising candidate for the production of high purity cobalt . <n> cobalt is one of the most abundant elements in the earth s crust and plays an important role in a wide range of applications , ranging from the synthesis and processing of industrial metals to the formation of superconductors and superfluids @xcite . due to its large size and relative insensitivity to temperature , cobalt can be used as a superconductor with a very high critical current . in order to produce high current ,<n> it is important to minimize the effects of temperature on the electronic structure of the material , and one way to do that is to increase the kinetic energy of the reaction by cooling it to room temperature . at low temperatures , the electron temperature<n> is reduced by cooling the material to room the stability of 5-phenyltetrazole , c10h17d2o7 , has been investigated by _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .<n> the dft results for the @xmath0 values are in good agreement with those of dft -

cellular environment of a living system , such as a lung , is of paramount importance . here<n> , we demonstrate the use of ultrafast optical excitation of fluorophores for the manipulation of lung pulsations in rats .<n> we show that the intensity of the emitted fluorescence is proportional to the square root of the time delay between the excitation light and the emission of the pulsatile signal , and that this effect can be exploited to increase the time resolution of optical microscopy . <n> optical microscopy is a powerful tool for the study of living systems , but its limitations limit its use to situations where the spatial extent of the system is not an issue : for example , in the presence of strong winds , earthquakes , or other natural catastrophes , the extent of a system can be severely limited . on the other hand , it is possible to use optical excitation to control the spatial and temporal evolution of a biological system such as lung . in this work ,<n> we demonstrate that optical excitation can be used to manipulate pulsotile signals in rat lung to study its spatio - temporal dynamics , its response to different environmental perturbations and its ability to respond in this work , we report on the development of a new algorithm for the visualization of nadh and fad surface fluorescence signals .<n> the algorithm is based on the concept of a gradient - gradient interface , where the gradient of the interface is measured by a fiber - optic probe , while the fluorescence signals are visualized using a fiber optic probe and a camera . <n> nadh , fluorescence intensity distribution , fiber optic microscopy , high - resolution imaging , bovine serum albumin , raman spectroscopy , and raman laser ablation are examples of applications of this new algorithm . in recent years , there has been an explosion of interest in the potential use of high - speed imaging techniques in the diagnosis of animal diseases @xcite . among the many imaging techniques that have been proposed for this purpose ,<n> one of the most promising is the use of fluorescence intensity distributions ( fids ) , in which the intensity of a fluorescence signal is measured using the fiber -

cell to multi - cell systems , in which mitochondria are involved in the regulation of their own internal and external environments @xcite . for this reason , the field of intracellular mitochondria has developed a number of complementary and complementary research areas , including _<n> ab initio _ methods , such as the development of single - molecule motors that control mitochondria response to chemical and environmental stimuli @xmath0  * metabolic disorders are characterized by an overabundance of enzymes , such as erythrocytes , in the blood .<n> enzyme - mediated mechanisms are often invoked to account for the presence of enzymes in the system . in this study<n> , we investigated the effects of metabolic inhibitors on the surface fad and nadh fluorescence signals in rats with hyperoxic and normoxic lungs . <n> we found that the addition of kcn to the standard treatment with pcp or rotenone significantly increased the nadh signal , but did not change the fad signal . for rotenone and pcp , the fad and<n> nadh signals increased with kcn , and decreased with rotenone , respectively , resulting in an increase in the normalized flux of nadh . * <n> metabolic disorders ( dms ) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both humans and animals @xcite . despite their importance ,<n> the mechanisms by which enzymes are involved in the formation and destruction of dm are not well understood , although there are a number of enzymes that are believed to play a role in dm . among the enzymes that have been proposed to be responsible for the formation of the dm * background : * pulmonary pulsations ( ppcs ) are a common cause of morbidity and mortality .<n> ppcs are characterized by irregular , irregular breathing patterns , accompanied by a progressive loss of energy , pressure , and momentum , as well as a progressive increase in the amplitude of the sound velocity and the frequency of oscillations , suggesting the presence of a non - bacterial , viral or fungal infection in the airway . * purpose :<n> * in this study , we investigate the effect of non - pathogenic bacteria , namely , kcn and pcp , on ppcs by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . <n> * methods : _ first , _ we simulate the ppc response to pcp and kcn by introducing a new bacterium , called kcn , into the system . in this way ,<n> we are able to reduce the effects of pcp on ppc , especially in hyperoxic lungs , where kcn is known to cause significant damage to lung tissue . to further reduce the damage caused by pcp<n> , the introduction of kcn in the system is made in two ways . hyperoxic exposure is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in rodent populations .<n> however , it is still poorly understood . in this study , we investigated the effect of hyperoxia - induced changes in mitochondrial redox state on the complex i and ii activities of lung homogenates in rats , and compared the results to those obtained for normoxic and hypermoxic lungs . <n> _ keywords : _ lung , mitochondria , redox state , hyperoxics , t - test . we report a hyperoxia - induced change in lung aconitase activity measured on the surface of the lung .<n> this change is found to be consistent with the change in complex i redox state , which was previously reported by bassett et al . <n> [ j. chem . phys . * 127 * , 064106 ( 2011 ) ] . in this study , we investigated the effect of exposure to 100% for 48 hrs on the krebs cycle enzymes isocitrate , pyruvate , alpha - ketoglutarate dehydrogenase , and their coenzymes coa and lipoic acid . we found that the measured change in the activity of these enzymes is not significantly affected by 100% exposure , while their activity is reduced after exposure to higher concentrations of both normoxic and hyperoxic mitochondria . however , the decrease in pyruvation - activity , as measured by the decrease of isotopologues , is more significant . since the discovery of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in _<n> mitochondria _ @xcite , a large effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanism of the instability , with particular emphasis on there is ample evidence that increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) is a major pathophysiological factor in the genesis of hyperoxic lung injury .<n> one strategy that cells may have evolved to mitigate the activities of ros sources is to protect against ros injury by increasing the rate of mitochondria to cytosolic ros ( mitochondria to mitochondria matrix , etc ) . in this study<n> , we demonstrate that hyperoxia - induced decrease in nadh signal in the presence of pcp in the mitochondria matrix as compared to that in normoxic lungs as a measure of the coupling between etc and phosphorylation could be an adaptive mechanism by the cells to decrease ros production in the vicinity of mitochondria . on the other hand , the measured decrease in complex i activity could represent hyperoxian - induced injury leading to increased ros formation . <n> ros is a key mediator of cellular processes such as photosynthesis , ion transport , and differentiation . since ros forms in mitochondria , it is expected that mitochondria are involved in many cellular processes , such as , e.g. , photosynthesis @xcite . moreover , studies have shown that oxidative phosphorylation at complex i in endothelial cells we demonstrate that complex i activity in microvascular endothelial cells is reduced when exposed to hyperoxia .<n> this decrease in activity is due to an increase in the rate of ros formation , which depends on the activity of the mdna complex i subunit , and is consistent with lung treatment with the metabolic inhibitors rotenone and kcn . in addition , we find that the decrease in complex ii activity in the presence of kcn is more significant than that in normoxic lungs . <n> ros is an enzyme that is involved in the formation of endothelial cells , including mitochondria , muscle , blood vessels and connective tissue , as well as in the regulation of cholesterol and blood pressure @xcite . since mitochondria and blood vessels are sensitive to ros , it is important to understand the mechanisms by which ros acts in order to reduce the damage in these systems . to this end<n> , many experiments have investigated the effect of different substrates on ros in endothelial cells ( see refs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 we report a hyperoxia - induced decrease in redox - sensitive flavoprotein ( fad ) signal in rat lung tissue from normoxic to hyperoxic conditions .<n> the measured decrease in fad signal is attributed to a decrease in the complex ii redox state . since electrons channeled through<n> complex ii produce 4-fold more mitochondrial superoxide than electrons channelled through complex i , the apparent decrease in complex ii activity could be a means by the cells to reduce ros formation . <n> lung tissue is cytoplasm - rich in mitochondria , and as a result both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments are more reduced in hyperoxiic lungs thannormoxic lungs . in this study , we measured the change in lung surface nadh signal in the presence of documentclass[12pt]minimal  usepackageamsmath$end document  as a measure of complex i and ii activity . the measured change in nadh signals in the present study represents a relatively early in situ metabolic consequence of hyperoxial in that it precedes effects on lung histology , hemodynamic and functional endpoints observed with rat exposure to  documentclass[1pt ] .$ (  the metabolic consequences of hyperoxia in intact rats exposed to 100% oxygen have been reported in a few studies . in the present study<n> , we report a decrease in the complex i mediated coenzyme minimal  $  usepackageamsbsy $end documentclass[12pt ] , setlengthoddsidemargin-69pt  ( ) begindocumentclass12ptuse packageamssymb = sumrm q_1$ ] for 48 hours ) and an increase in lactate production , as compared to that in normoxic rats .<n> additionally , this decrease in metabolism occurs prior to effects on lung histology , hemodynamic , and functional endpoints observed with rat exposure to  minimal  @xmath0 $ ] [ 12pt].<n> the results of this paper suggest that in hyperoxic lungs prior to the onset of inflammation , the mitochondria are less efficient in converting carbon dioxide into adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) than they are in a non -

mills theory on a stack of d3-branes and d5-branes does not have a supercon formal fixed point in the infrared .<n> this helps rule out strong coupling behaviors in the ir field theory which are not gaugino condensation . <n> [ [ section ] ] the study of supersymmetric gauge theories has a long history , going back to the work of bekenstein and hawking @xcite . in the 1960 s<n> it was suggested that supersymmetry may be broken in gauge theories by the addition of fermions , a proposal that was later contradicted by schwinger and others . since then<n> , supersymmetry has been broken in a variety of gauge theories , including the standard model of particle physics , the gauge theory of qcd , and a number of different gauge theories based on gravity and/or gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) . among the gauge theories that have been broken by supersymmetry ,<n> there is one type of gauge theory which is not supersymmetric : the standard gauge theory , which is a supersymmetric extension of the non - supersymmetric standard model ( we consider a supersymmetric @xmath0 gauge theory with @x , @xcite , and @x,@xcite global symmetries .<n> the gauge theory has a classical superpotential w = u_r2 y_2 v1 - u_d1 y_2 2  2 $ ] , which is the dominant scale in the problem . at strong coupling ,<n> the theory has no d3-branes , no d5-branes and no chiral symmetry breaking . however , at low energies , we expect confinement and gluino condensation to occur . <n> defearendaligned ]<n> ] the supersymmetric standard model ( sm ) is the best known and most widely used model of elementary particle physics . in its simplest form<n> , the sm consists of a single scalar field , known as the higgs field . on the other hand , in gauge theories , there are many scalar fields , called fermions , as well as vector and pseudoscalar fields<n> . there may also exist fermionic degrees of freedom , so - called higgs triplets . we consider supersymmetric @xmath0 flavor grand unified theories with four flavors .<n> we show that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at a non - trivial point in the space of coupling constants , and that there is a branch of moduli space where baryonic operators get expectation values . <n> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most intriguing predictions of high energy physics . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,<n> the higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of superconductivity and the weak scale , while the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism is the mechanism that leads to the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bao ) and the origin of neutrino oscillations @xcite . however , supersymmetry can also be broken in different ways , depending on the details of the flavor structure of the theory . for example , in the simplest su(5 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) , there are three flavors , but in more complicated theories with more than two flavors supersymmetry may be broken , or the gut may be a multiplet of a singlet . as a result , sparticle masses may be in this letter , we discuss the konishi anomaly and supersymmetry breaking in the @xmath0 supersymmetric quiver theory . in this theory ,<n> supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies .<n> we argue that this is a generic feature of quiver theories in which the baryonic branch of the theory interpolates between the maldacena -

limit flux becomes 3.8 mjy for unclustered sources and 2.0 mjy with clustered sources , respectively , when the flux is 50 mjy . in order to evaluate the clustering effect , we calculate the correlation functions of the infrared galaxies based on an empirical model of sdss : the galaxies are represented by a gaussian random field with a scale length @x we present analytic formulae for the confusion limits from power - law number counts and from higher - order correlation functions , based on the methods related to the point field theory . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure . as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxy counts ,<n> we calculated the confusion limit from the power - laws number counts .<n> we found a broadening of the pdf by clustering , i.e. , increase of the variance , corresponding to the increase ofthe confusion limit flux density . when @xmath0 approaches to 2.0 , the clustering effect becomes very severe for a power -law number count . for the estimation of the galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data that will be obtained by _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf _ , accurate estimate of the clustering properties is desired . in this line , only the work of @xcite has made attempt to tackle the difficult problem and given solutions to a few simple cases . <n> the confusion problem is a long - standing problem of the astronomical history , going back to the works of eddington . we present a new method for the analysis of the submillimeter number counts and fluctuations .<n> we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion noise with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts , and from the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation field . at infrared wavelengths ,<n> the clustering effect becomes very severe , so that the pdf and confusion limits become very large , even though present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics . <n> we also applied our method to future submillimeter large surveys , such as _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf_.<n> our analysis plays an important role as an interface between observed submillimeter data and sophisticated complex cosmological models . in this paper , we study the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a gapless and a gapped phase of @xmath0-wave superconductors ( scs ) .<n> we show that in the gapless phase , the bcs order parameter is proportional to the phase of the gap in the bulk of the system , while it is an order parameter in the superconducting phase that determines the transition between the two phases . in the case of gapped scs<n> , however , this phase transition is accompanied by an abrupt change in the critical temperature of the superconducting state , which is an indication of the phase transition . <n> pacs numbers : : 74.50.+r , 73.40.gk , 74.72.-h , 75.10.pq phase transitions ( pt ) @xcite , also known as phase transitions in condensed matter physics , have been extensively studied in the last two decades , both theoretically and experimentally , due to the importance of the transition to a new quantum state of matter ( qm ) in the vicinity of a new superconducting phase . for a phase transition to take place ,<n> the order parameter in this paper , we present a method to determine the number of sources per beam in the case of airy beam .<n> this method is based on the assumption that the beam pattern of an optical instrument can be described by an airy function . using this method ,<n> we calculate the confusion limit of sources in the beam of an x - ray ccd interferometer as a function of the beam size , the effective beam area , and the exponent of the power - law angular correlation function of galaxies . we find that the number @xmath0 of sources is strongly dependent on these parameters : the more effective beam size and the steeper the slope of the angular correlations function , more severe is the confusion . for a beam of size<n> i@xmath1 cm , which corresponds to the beam area of a typical ccd in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a confusion limit @x , i.e. , number of times that a source can be detected in one period of the interferometric data , is expected to be around 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 70 , 80 , 100 , or we present a new method for the statistical analysis of point sources in a beam .<n> the method is based on two novel ideas : ( i ) the correlation function of a point field is approximated by the product of a random variable and the beam pattern , and ( ii ) a random field can be approximated with the help of the laplace transform of a certain probability generating functional ( pgfl ) . in this paper , we present the first application of the method to the analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) to search for point sources . <n> we present results for the two - point correlation function ( @xmath0 ) and the differential source number count ( dsc ) as a function of the position of the source in the dr7 beam , as well as for the mean number of sources in the beam and the flux density of the sources , for a wide range of beam sizes , beam shapes and detection limits . for the point source analysis ,<n> we show that the power -

mass secondaries . on the other hand , if we assume that wide binaries are formed initially with both components drawn from the same mass function , then the ratio between the observed and predicted (  current '' ) luminosity function shows a trend that suggests that the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time . since the absolute magnitude of main sequence stars is correlated with mass<n> , this suggests that star formation processes we have used the lspm -

minimizing map can be extended onto a minimizer of the ricci flow , thus providing the first example of an area - minimizer for a smooth map that is not smooth on the interior . the notion of a _<n> boundary area_@xmath1 of a we consider a one -

known metric of flat euclideen space , and that the metric for the boundary consists of two parts : the first part is a geodesic segment and the second part is the geodesic segment between two fixed points . the first step in the construction of such a metric is to find a point on in this note , we show that the geodesic curvature of a self - intersection in @xmath0 can be computed in terms of the first and second derivatives of the projection of the map between two points on the boundary of the intersection .<n> we also show that if the geodesic coordinates are chosen in such a way that the curvatures of the self - intersections are all the same up to a constant error , then there is a minimizer of the curvature in the map . <n> [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the first purpose of this note is to present a proof of the existence of a geodesic curvature that is equal to the curvature of the euclidean metric for every non - empty set of points in the intersection of two self - intersecting riemannian curves . in this paper<n> we only consider the case of one face only . for the sake of clarity<n> we will assume that the metric for each face is smooth , harmonic , and almost conformal on the interior of the set of self - intersect points . as a result ,<n> the proof is somewhat simplified : we only need to prove that for every open subset of length at most two there exists a geodesic coordinate such that for each open subset @x in this note , we give a new proof of the existence of solutions to the plateau problems for certain piecewise smooth maps @xmath0 that are contractible in the projective plane .<n> the proof is based on the method of @xcite , which allows one to prove existence of non - differentiable solutions to certain douglas - type boundary value problems for smooth maps . <n> the idea of this paper is to show that if we have a map that has a plateau problem , then there is a solution to the corresponding plateau problem for this map . in the case in which the regularity of the map is the same for all but finitely many branch points ,<n> we show that the plateau problem can be reduced to a one - dimensional boundary value problem for which there exists a solution . as an example<n> , this shows that one can prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for the following plateau problems : + ( i ) for a map @xxmath1 that is piecewise contractible and piecewise homogeneous in the plane , with regularity equal to one and with branch points of regularity at most two ; + ( ii ) a map which is contractible , piecewise continuous , in this paper , we prove a variational identity relating the volume form of the pull - back of a ricci flow to its volume form .<n> we apply this result to the study of two - dimensional riemannian flows . <n> let @xmath0 be a smooth , compactly supported , one - parameter family of ricci flows with boundary . by definition ,<n> the volume forms of the pulls - backs of these flows are @xcite : they are given by the restriction of the flow to the union of a finite number of copies of a compact set , called a _ loop _ , and a boundary , respectively . in the case<n> in which the loop is restricted to the set of copies and the boundary is the boundary of the loop , then the restriction must be nonnegative and the loop must satisfy the douglas - type condition . for a loop<n> whose boundary is not contained in the loop and whose length is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the other loops , the restriction is said to be _ nonnegative _ if for any two of the loops in the restriction , any two points on the boundary intersect in their interior . let @xmath0 be the set of finitely many self - intersections of curves on the plane .<n> we prove that the geodesic curvatures of the curves in @xxmath1 are uniformly bounded , almost everywhere . as an application<n> , we show that for every integer @math2 there is a self - intersection of the following form : for every rational number @math3 there is an open subset of the plane that is either empty or contains the intersection of two distinct edges . in this case , the boundary of the open subset is a convex polytope that is invariant under the action of the group of all open subsets . <n> the proof of the main result is based on a variation formula for curves that are self - intersecting with respect to the euclidean metric , as well as an analysis of the combinatorics of these self - junctions . *<n> introduction. * the study of geodesic curvature curvatures has a long history , going back to the work of jacobi @xcite , and it has become an important topic in the geometry of surfaces , starting with the works of gauss , shilnikov , lenz and others ( see  we show that the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space is isometric to the minkowski space whenever the dimension of the metric is greater than or equal to three .<n> this is the first result of its kind for a non -

gluon plasma ( qgp ) is important for a number of fundamental issues in high energy physics , such as the determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of qcd , the precise measurement of the gluon density in the medium , as well as studies of the structure of the medium itself @xcite . the large hadron we present the monte carlo simulation results for _ z _ production in hadron colliders , using the @xmath0 _ _z__+3 jet and the mpi and mpi+@xmath1 formalisms .<n> we show that it is possible to choose a good tune for the parameters in the multiple parton interactions model ( amisic ) for the @ x generator , depending on the kinematic region and energy of the process . <n> title=\"fig : \"<n> [ cols= \"  \" , ] we have simulated the production of the z boson at the lhc ( 7 tev ) , in both the electron and muon channels . in the electron channel<n> , we have performed a new analysis , which is different from the previous analysis performed at the tevatron , and we have shown that this new analysis can improve the agreement between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data . for the muon channel ,<n> we have also studied the behaviour of the cross sections of the processes , showing that the new analysis gives a better description of the data in the region of mid - range transverse momentum of the _ we analyze the _ z _ @xmath0 , and the , as a function of bins of _z _ , the transverse momentum of the jets .<n> we compare the results with tevatron , with mpi turned on and off , for both the mc and mpi models . for the mpi model off in the generators , we find that the behaviour is very similar to that without mpi , except for the leading jet , which shows a behaviour that is very different from tev . <n> we also analyze the data for the sum of jets , to see if there are additional particles from mpi that do nt contribute to the jet . at least one jet is required.,title=\"fig : \" ] difference between the results of the  z '' and  leading jet '' analyses , at the lhc , is the systematic difference in the description of the transverse momenta of the hadrons in the two events . in the analysis of the data<n> , it is impossible to isolate the different effects of mpi and hard scatters , or extend below the transversemomenta cut used in analysis . with we present the analysis of the drell - yan process at tevatron and lhc energies , with the following results : the difference between the leading jet @xmath0 and the sum of all jets : _ z _  30gev , 30 gev  _z _ > 100 gev for three regions of boson . _<n> z_@xmath1  50 gev,50 gev and , for the first time , the sum .<n> the mpi model in the generators disagrees from each other in the balance for both the sum and leading jet . at least one jet is required.,title=\"fig : 3slicesmpion \" ,title \" : sum of jets , and the difference for three region of bosons.,width=151 ] in the past few years , much attention has been paid to drell yan ( dy ) processes at the lhc . in particular , it has been shown that , in addition to the standard model ( sm ) particles , several new bosons can be produced , such as the sneutrino @x we present a selection of recent results from d0 , cdf , tevatron , rhic and lhc .<n> we focus on particle production in p+p collisions at @xmath0 = 1.96 tev , p+@xmath1 , z+p , and z+x collisions at the same center -

antiproton experiments at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) . in these collisions ,<n> several interesting phenomena have been observed , such as the production of z - boson pairs @xcite , azimuthal anisotropy of the jets in pb+pb collisions @x<n> . the ratio of the transverse momenta of the produced particles , known as the transverse momentum distribution ( tmd ) has been measured",

generalization of the pulsation equation and present first numerical results obtained with the correct equation .<n> in contrast to earlier studies we investigate charged stars with a realistic eos . our results show that the presence of a slight charge inbalance may help to reconcile soft equations of state with observations of massive pulsars . furthermore , an enhancement of the oscillation period at given central baryonic density is observed . radial oscillations of compact stars are considered within the framework of a relativistic mean field model for dense hadronic matter and a mit bag model for quark matter .<n> the pulsation equation is derived and applied to oscillations of both neutral and charged stars . for the latter case we assume a distribution of charge density proportional to the baryon number density . while for constant density stars this distribution is inconsistent with the employed eos @xcite , this is not the case for the charged ones . <n> compact stars ( cs ) are stellar configurations with masses in the range of a few @xmath0 , which are formed in the early stages of stellar evolution and are thought to have masses of about a few solar masses . due to their small size and compactness<n> , cs are expected to be gravitationally bound and hence to have a strong stellar magnetic field . in the last years , a great deal of work has been done to understand the structure and evolution of compact objects , including their interiors , their interiors composition and their dynamics . among these properties , one of the most important is the mass - radius relation , i.e. the relation between the radius of the star and the mass we study the effect of electric charge on radial oscillations of compact stars .<n> it is shown that electric charge has a significant effect on the amplitude and phase of the pulsations . in particular<n> we find that the electric charge strongly affects the amplitude of the oscillations . for stars with electric charge @xmath0<n> the amplitude is found to be smaller than that of the non - electric charge . <n> chandrasekhar s work @xcite revealed the existence of a non - linear , dispersive , oscillatory , damped mode in the equation of motion of a compact star . this mode , which we call the _ radial oscillation _ ( rao ) , is characterized by a periodic modulation of the radial velocity , with the period equal to the period of the star s rotation , and a period of oscillation that is proportional to the square of the amplitude , i.e. , it is a damped , radially oscillating mode . the mode is analogous to the mode of a charged particle moving in a periodic potential . as a result<n> , the mode has a damping time that depends on the charge of the system , namely , einstein s equation is the prototype of the pulsation equation .<n> it is well known that its diagonal components can be subtracted from their equilibrium position . in this paper<n> we show that the equilibrium components of the einstein equation can also be subtracted , but only if the perturbations obey an harmonic time dependence . for the schwarzschild metric ,<n> the enclosed electric charge is defined as @xmath0=4pisqrtgjnu$ ] and the enclosed charge is given by the differential equations for the charge @xcite . if we impose stationarity and set the radial velocity to zero , the equilibrium condition derived by bekenstein is valid . however , it is not justified to replace the 4-velocity by the standard 4-velocity . <n> [ [ section ] ] einstein was the first to introduce the electrostatic field into electrostatics . his work was motivated by the observation that the electric field of a charged particle can not be quantized by a single quantizer . as a result , einstein introduced the electrostatic maxwell equation , which is the differential equation for the electric charge enclosed in a neutral fluid , @x pulsations in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be caused by the interaction of the accelerated particles with the surrounding medium .<n> we present a general , non - perturbative method to calculate the perturbations caused by such interactions . as an example<n> , we apply the method to the collision of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0rb with an isospin-@xmath1 barotropic equation of state . <n> _ introduction. _ <n> the physics of collisions of relativistic heavy ions is one of the most active areas of research in nuclear and particle physics . in recent years<n> a great deal of attention has been paid to the problem of how the collisional dynamics is modified due to the interaction with the medium @xcite , in particular in the context of collisions with ultrarelativistic particles . for this reason ,<n> a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of the interaction between the particles and the medium , as well as to the treatment of the dynamics of the particles in the medium ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) . at the same time , much the relativistic equation of state @xmath0 for a polytropic star is solved to find the frequencies of radial pulsations .<n> the quark phase is shown to affect the frequencies in a non - negligible way , so that deviations from the polytropic value can be as small as 1% , except for a single star . <n> stars , neutron stars and white dwarfs are the sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) . in the gravitational field of a neutron star ,<n> the gw frequency is determined by the mass of the neutron star and the angular momentum of the stellar rotation . for a white dwarf<n> , the gravitational wave frequency can be calculated from the mass - angular momentum relation , which is given in the figure ,title=\"fig:\",width=317,height=317 ] . here<n> we study the gravitational waves produced by the rotation of white dwarf and neutron star stars in a relativistic stellar model , given in tabulated form . to calculate the frequencies we first solve the equations of relativistic stellar structure . then the discrete values of the frequencies are found by matching the boundary conditions on the stellar surface . a cubic spline interpolation scheme is used for the realistic eos we study the oscillation frequencies of neutral hybrid stars with a realistic quark matter equation of state . we find that the presence of the mixed phase , which sets in at the onset of the phase transition , leads to a large relative error in oscillation frequencies , up to 13% for a single star .<n> we argue that in the case of density jumps the eigenmode equation should not be applied through the discontinuity , but rather for each phase separately , with additional boundary conditions at the phase boundary . <n> hybrid stars are stellar systems in which two stars , a red giant and a blue straggler , merge to form a compact object with a mass in the range @xmath0@xmath1 . in this case<n> the red giant is expected to be a helium star , while the blue spheroid is a neutron star @xcite . for a given stellar mass ,<n> the evolution of the hybrid star is governed by the mass - radius diagram , and the oscillation frequency is a measure of the mass of the helium star ( the mass limit ) . as a result<n> , oscillation frequencies can be used to estimate the masses of the two stars and the mass range over which we construct models of hadronic and hybrid stars , consistent with recent observations @xcite . we show , that the presence of deconfined quarks at the center of hybrid stars reduces the oscillation frequencies of the fundamental radial mode .<n> the general behavior is a decrease in the oscillation frequency at given central baryon density . the departure from global charge - neutrality<n> is accompanied by a substancial increase in the gravitational mass , which allows the star to contain more baryons . <n> [ [ section ] ] recent observations of rotating , hybrid and supermassive stars provide new constraints on the equations of state of dense matter . in @xmath0 ,<n> the observation of a non - thermal photon emission from a rotating star , was reported . at the same time<n> , it was shown that the radial oscillations of rotating hybrid stars exhibit a kink in the frequency curve , at the onset of the phase transition from the hadronic to the mixed phase . here<n> we show that this kink is due to an instability of the radial eigenmode . to comply with the mass limit<n> there is a small region at the centre , in which the mixed state is limited to a small supermassive stars are considered to be the best laboratories for testing the standard model of particle physics .<n> we show that a class of supermassive charged neutral stars is compatible with the observational constraint on the mass - radius relation , provided that the star is rotating and has an equation of state different from that of the quark - gluon plasma . <n> [ firstpage ] stars : abundances , stellar evolution , abundances x - rays : general , x - ray binaries : close [ [ section ] ] in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in supermassive compact stars ( scs ) , which are believed to be progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) @xcite . in order to be detected , these stars must have a mass larger than about @xmath0 , and a radius smaller than a few parsecs . for a ssc of this mass ,<n> the minimum distance between the star and the center of mass is about 100 pc , but it is expected to be within 100 pc of the earth within a few thousand years . at these distances<n> the star s mass must be larger than @ we comment on a recent paper by chanmugam [ phys . rev . lett . * 108 * , 240401 ( 2013 ) ] , which presents an analytical expression for the surface tension of a neutron - deuteron plasma .<n> however , we find that the expression given there is in contradiction to the one we use here . we show that this discrepancy can be resolved by a suitable choice of the outer boundary condition at the surface . <n> the problem of the numerical evaluation of surface tension in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite . in particular , it has been suggested to use the eft in order to study the behavior of the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 in the vicinity of the critical point , where the system undergoes a phase transition from a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to a deconfined state . to this end , several analytical expressions have been given in the literature , but only a few of them are in complete agreement with the numerical solutions of the eos obtained by schaffner -

section so these events all have positive weights and unweighted event generation may be accomplished by applying monte carlo hit - and - miss . by fixing the total missing transverse momentum rather than the individual contributions from the invisible neutrino and unobserved jets , an integration volume of real emissions phase space can be generated and so the cancellations between the real emissions and one - loop graphs can be achieved by a monte - carlo integration over this jet volume . the charged lepton vectors are kept fixed in the laboratory frame throughout the integration . since the jet volume may be large , the fixing of the observable quantities is essential . an integration which instead keeps other quantities such as the subprocess energy and boost fixed ( as would be the case if the method were applicable to such large jet volumes ) would also we present an algorithm for the integration of jet volumes in hadronic @xmath0 production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) using the missing transverse momentum generated by an invisible neutrino .<n> we apply this algorithm to the process , which has been calculated in the standard model , and compare the results with calculations of other hadronic processes . <n> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#1 # 1@xmath1 # 10= 0=0 1= 1=1 0>1 # 1 / = cmssbx10 scaled 2 to fixed order perturbative qcd calculations in the region where the soft and collinear divergences overlap may be visualized in terms of an expansion in powers of @xmath0  2 ] ] where is the qcd coupling , the scale of the interaction , and the transverse momentum of the order real emission .<n> when the jet transverse momentum is small relative to the jet energy , multi -

einstein correlations ( bec ) of the leptonic decays of the top quark have been studied extensively . in particular , it is well known that the top decay is accompanied by the production of a jet , i.e. , a charged lepton with transverse momentum below the cut - off in the transverse plane of the jet . this kinematic region is usually referred to as the 0 jet region . here<n> we present an algorithm for generating events in this region of phase space , where the cut off is 1 jet and the event is defined in terms of observable quantities . using this method ,<n> event generation for the top plus jet channel at the lhc is now possible for the first time we present the results of a monte carlo study of di - boson production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .<n> we include the effects of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in the framework of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) for the first time in the context of the lhc phenomenology . <n> the discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) at the tevatron @xcite has been a major milestone in the quest for the origin of neutrino masses and lepton mixing . at the same time<n> , it has become clear that neutrino oscillations play an important role in the dynamics of the standard model , and that supersymmetry is the only known non - perturbative mechanism for generating neutrino masses , mixings and cp violation in the lepton sector . in order to fully exploit the physics of neutrino oscillations at lhc it is necessary to understand the structure of the supersymmetric model ( smss ) beyond the sm ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for a review of the smmss framework ) @x we present a study of the monte carlo event rates expected at the international linear collider ( ilc ) in the case where the charged lepton fields are produced in association with one or more jets .<n> we compare the results of different di - boson integration packages , and discuss the observable event rates which can be extracted from the cross - sections . <n> the ilc is a high energy @xmath0 collider , currently under construction in the gran sasso national laboratory in italy @xcite . in the absence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at the lhc ,<n> this is a unique opportunity to study fundamental physics at an energy frontier unprecedented in any other accelerator or collider experiment . for the first time , we will be able to study the lepton sector of the sm at an lhc energy , which is an order of magnitude higher than the energies available at the tevatron and the large hadron collider in the u.s . with a 10 kt , 30 kt and 100 kt luminosity , respectively . at the icl<n> , there will be four main ilc detectors , each sensitive to one of two observable final states  the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) parameter , @xmath0 , which describes the ratio of the branching ratios of the three standard model ( sm ) electroweak gauge bosons , is one of the most important observables at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .<n> this parameter can be extracted from a variety of observables in lepton pair production , such as rapidity , transverse momentum , and invariant mass distributions . in this paper<n> we present a study of the sensitivity of the lhcb to the lfvs of the sm , including the effects of cp violation in the leptonic sector . <n> the study is based on a re - weighting scheme which takes into account the constraints on the observables imposed by a given detector , as described in refs . 5.5 , 5.5.4 , 5.8 , 8.0 . here<n> we summarize the results of two different studies , one motivated by what the detectors are capable of measuring , the other by what they can not measure , using the cteq4 m structure functions and the bho package for event evaluation . for the latter study<n> we evaluate the algorithm s we present a phase space approach to the study of jet quenching in @xmath0 annihilation .<n> the approach employs a hybrid algorithm for the evaluation of matrix elements , phase space slicing , and is applied to the case of the zeus collaboration at hera . <n> qcd corrections to the production of jets in high energy hadron - hadron collisions are of fundamental importance to our understanding of the mechanism of energy loss . in particular<n> , the energy loss of a jet can be used as a probe of the properties of the underlying quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in which the hadrons are created . to date<n> there has been little experimental evidence for the existence of the qgp and theoretical calculations of its properties have been limited to the soft gluon approximation , which is valid in a limited range of jet properties . here<n> we show that the phase space method presented here , combined with a hybrid approach , allows for the first time a quantitative study of the jet energy loss as a function of jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity in the vicinity of the production cross - section . with the advent of large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies ,<n> the we present an algorithm to generate one weighted event from a sample of unweighted events using the bho matrix elements .<n> the algorithm is able to reproduce the leading order prediction for @xmath0 jet production at the lhc , and is also able to predict the cross -

inclusive and exclusive . in the inclusive search all the particles are produced in pairs and the mass of the final state leptons and quarks is known , which allows the search to be performed in a relatively clean environment . the semi - exclusive search is more delicate and requires a large number of events to be produced before the signal can be separated from the background . <n> the leptonic decays of higgs particles can be divided into two main types , inclusive and semi - leptonic , each of which has its own set of a new algorithm is presented for the generation of a sample of a few low luminosity lhc years of data using computer farms of the size currently in use at most universities or experiments .<n> the effect of remnant negative weight events is evaluated , and it is shown that these events are negligible in all cases . <n> the @xmath0 process is sensitive to anomalous couplings between the weak vector boson and the higgs boson at the tevatron and at the lhc . in this talk<n> i will present the results of a monte carlo study of the sensitivity of this process to these couplings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order(nlo ) @xcite , where the parameters are fixed to fit results from lep1 and slac , respectively . at the nlo ,<n> the results are improved by about a factor of 2 over those from the lep results , while at the lo case the improvement is about an order of magnitude . for the measurement of the coupling constants<n> , it will be important to measure the couplings with an accuracy better than about 10% . we describe an algorithm for unweighted event generation at the partonic process @xmath0 with leptonic decays .<n> we evaluate the effectiveness of this algorithm at the large hadron collider . we present an algorithm for the generation of events with a given jet transverse momentum using the phase space slicing method .<n> this algorithm is designed to be used in conjunction with the bho integration package . <n> = cmr8 1.5pt # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics predicts the existence of a number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , the weak gauge bosons , as well as fermions such as the @xmath0 and the z bosons @xcite . in the electroweak sector , these bosons can be produced by the interaction of the photon with a quark or gluon field , e.g. , via the exchange of a weak gauge field such as a photon or a gluon , or through the decay of the quark and gluon into a pair of quarks and leptons ( the higgs mechanism ) , such as in the case of supersymmetry ( susy ) or more . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) it will be possible to study these processes , which are important in susy we present the results of a global analysis of @xmath0 production at the lhc , including d , d0 , cdf and lhcb , with the aim of searching for evidence of new physics .<n> we find no evidence for a signal , and set a 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper limit on the production cross section of 10@xmath1 . <n> = cmr8 1.5pt # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) the d0 collaboration at the large hadron collider has recently reported the first evidence for the production of the higgs boson @xcite . at the same time , the cdf collaboration has reported the discovery of a new resonance , , at a center -

possible in a more general setting than evolution governed by a hamiltonian . quantum irreversibility and thermalization must be a consequence of entanglement . as we shall see , it is not the amount of entanglement per se that is important .<n> this is too much of a simple and generic notion . a specific pattern of entanglement<n> , though , is what is important for irreversability . questions that have been asked for decades and remained somehow unresolved can now be looked from a new point of view . in particular , entanglement is not neutral ( like energy ) with respect to the degrees of freedom that are involved . we discuss the question of irreversibility of entanglement , which is the incapability of disentangling a quantum state , unless one tries out all the possible quantum evolutions .<n> we show that in this sense entanglement is complex in the degrees of freedom in which the interactions are simple . we show that the incapability of disentangling a quantum state due

entanglement corresponds to a wigner - dyson statistics . on the other hand , simple , removable entanglement possesses spectral fluctuations that follow , for instance , a poisson statistics , where

in random quantum unitary circuits * j. a. aguilar <n> saavedra@xmath1 , r. c. s we consider evolution of a quantum system subject to a random unitary quantum circuit . we find that evolution obtained by means of universal quantum computation is irreversible and the statistics of the level spacings of reduced density matrix spectrum is wigner - dyson , _ i.e _ , is complex . on the other hand , if the entanglement level spacing statistics is poisson , the disentangling algorithm succeeds , which means that the pattern of entanglement is not complex<n> . strikingly , this happens when the set of gates used is not universal for quantum computing . it is remarkable that reversibility arises with severe breaking of ergodicity .<n> if the sets of gates is notuniversal , not every state can be reached , and ergodity is broken . any unitary operation can be performed by a sequence of gates acting on one or two qubits at a time .<n> furthermore , only a finite number of such gates is needed to form the universal set of operations . here<n> we consider the set of quantum gates that are required to perform any arbitrary unitary operation on a classical computer . we show that , if the gate set is such that @xmath0 is an irrational multiple of the number of qubits , then the classical computer can not perform any operation faster than the quantum computer can perform , provided that the gates in the set form a universal set . <n> [ theorem]corollary [ theorem ]lemma [ theorem][ theorem]proposition quantum computers are expected to perform certain computational tasks much faster than their classical counterparts . in particular , it has been shown @xcite that quantum computers can solve certain types of problems faster than classical computers , for example , the cnot problem . on the other hand ,<n> it has also been shown that it is possible to use a quantum computer to solve the classical problem of factoring numbers faster than any classical computer that has been tuned to work with quantum gates . we show that the space of @xmath0 qubits can be decomposed into a finite set of subsets , the _ s _ subset , of operations .<n> the s subsets are the clifford group and the set of quantum circuits , which are sequences of gates written in such a way that any given unitary operation can be well approximated as the product of s and * p*@xmath1 , that is , as the inverse of * p * . in the case<n> that the hamiltonian of a quantum circuit can be written as a product of two hamiltonians , we give a formula for the number of operations needed to implement each s gate . <n> the problem of constructing a quantum computer is intimately related to the question of how many operations are needed to perform a universal quantum computation @xcite . for a classical computer ,<n> the length of a sequence of gates that is needed to realize a universal computation is bounded by the square root of the speed of light , and this is known to be the case for quantum computers : for example , for the quantum circuit required to realize the cnot gate on a qubit tof in the hilbert we study the entanglement properties of states that are obtained by evolving with a stochastic quantum circuit .<n> we show that the application of stochastic quantum circuits to a finite number of qubits , as well as the partitioning of the system in two parts , give rise to entanglement properties that are different from those of pure states . <n> entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum systems @xcite . in classical physics<n> , it means that a system can not be completely decoupled from its environment if it is entangled with it . however , in quantum physics , entanglement is not a property of the quantum system , but rather a consequence of the dynamics of the underlying system . for a classical system @xmath0 ,<n> the entanglement between any two parts of it is the same as the entanglement that would be obtained if the system were completely disentangled , that is , the two parts would be indistinguishable from each other . on the other hand , for a quantum system the entanglement can be very different from the classical one , and it can even be very large , so that it is difficult to completely decouple the system from the environment if we are interested in studying its entanglement properties . the we study the entanglement spectrum of a stochastic quantum circuit .<n> the circuit is made of many quantum gates , each one acting in a stochastic way . after applying a quantum circuit to a given state ,<n> we can try to find the state with maximum entanglement for a given system size @xmath0 . here<n> , we consider the average of the von neumann and rnyi entropies over the many realizations of the quantum circuit and we show that , as in the case of a classical stochastic process , the maximum entanglement is reached after a number of realizations that grows monotonically with the system size . <n> entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics . for a classical system , _<n> e.g. _ , an atom @xcite , entanglement is a source of quantum correlations that can be exploited for quantum information processing . however , in the quantum case , it is a resource that can not be exploited directly for quantum computation , but can be used to generate correlations between distant systems . in particular , there is a growing interest in the study of entanglement in stochastic quantum circuits ( sqcs ) , which have been we consider the problem of finding the ground state of an interacting quantum system in the state with the largest amount of entanglement for a given system size .<n> we refer to this state as _ entanglement cooling _ , and we show that it is possible to characterize the entanglement in this state _ without _ resorting to the inverse of the circuit to find it , namely , by using the statistics of the level spacings for the entanglement spectrum . <n> the idea of cooling the evolution of a quantum system from an entangled state to its ground state has been around for a long time @xcite . in the original cooling algorithm ,<n> the system is first prepared in a state with maximum entanglement , then it is evolved in a dissipative way , such that the evolution is reversible and the entanglement is not complex . since then , cooling algorithms have been proposed for other types of quantum systems , as well . here<n> , we focus on the case of interacting qubits , where the evolution can be made as efficient as possible . for a system of @xmath0 qubits in a two - mode cavity , the cooling algorithm can be applied to find the ground states of the system with maximum it has been shown that the amount of entanglement that can be generated by a single qubit system interacting with a noisy environment can be increased by cooling the system , and that this process is irreversible if the noise is too strong . here , we show that this is not always the case . in particular , if the algorithm used to cool the system does not follow a universal set of quantum circuits , the statistics of the level spacings for the entanglement spectrum is not consistent with wigner - dyson prediction and is akin to a poisson process . on the other hand ,<n> if the quantum circuits are not drawn from auniversal set , entanglement is not complex and the cooling algorithm always works .<n> our result shows that irreversibility is associated to a statistics of level spacing . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing properties of quantum systems @xcite . for a finite number of qubits<n> , there is an exponential decay of entanglement as a function of interaction strength @xmath0 with the environment . as a consequence , for a system of @x s , it is possible to generate an infinite amount of maximally entangled states ( mems ) by heating them , cooling them we study the effect of graph theoretic gates on the entanglement properties of random product states .<n> we show that entanglement heating , _ i.e. _ , the process by which the amount of entanglement in a random product state is increased before it saturates , is not able to distinguish universal from non - universal sets of gates . on the other hand , by cooling the random state to zero , we are able to identify the universal set of gates as well as the circuit that generates it . <n> entanglement is one of the most useful tools to study quantum many - body systems . in particular , it has proven to be a very powerful tool to investigate reversible quantum circuits @xcite , to identify non - equilibrium phases of the quantum ising model @x<n> . however , entanglement itself is not a good indicator of the nature of the underlying hamiltonian , since it does not take into account the full history of the system . as a result ,<n> it is not useful to use entanglement to distinguish between different sets of hamiltonians , even if it can be used to study reversible circuits . indeed , in spite of its success in the analysis of reversible quantum hamilton we show that the amount of entanglement that can be carried by a quantum state of a many - body system can be used to determine the set of gates that are required for its factorization .<n> we demonstrate this by simulating the evolution of a @xmath0-qubit system in a random product state , which is known to be completely factorized in the limit of a large number of gates . for a system of this size<n> , we find that the factorization process can be simulated very accurately , and that the number of required gates can be estimated from the entanglement of the state . <n> the ability to carry out quantum information processing with a high degree of precision is a central goal of modern physics . in this context ,<n> the experimental realization of large scale quantum computers has been a matter of intense theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . to achieve this goal , it is important to understand the effect of decoherence on the performance of a quantum computer , _<n> i.e. _ , the way in which a quantum system interacts with its environment . among the mechanisms proposed for this purpose , one of the most promising is the use of entanglement , a measure of how much a quantum entanglement cooling is a classical algorithm that can be used to cool down an initially entangled many - body state .<n> it is computationally heavy on a classical machine , but could be accelerated on a quantum machine . here , we propose a conjecture that if the state is a product of two substates , the algorithm will not reverse the state if we observe level repulsion , _<n> i.e. _ , a wigner - dyson level spacing behavior . to test this conjecture ,<n> we simulate the cooling algorithm for the case of a two - component fermi gas in an optical lattice at finite temperature . we find that the algorithm works well , with a typical error in the cooling time of about @xmath0 . <n> [ [ introduction ] ] introduction + + + / + +<n> + + the cooling of an initial entangled state is one of the most important problems in the study of finite - temperature localization of fermionic particles . in the past decade<n> , there has been a lot of interest in cooling quantum states @xcite , in particular to gain insight into the performance of quantum algorithms on quantum computers . among the algorithms proposed for classical computers<n> are the entanglement cooling we study the evolution of an entangled state at finite temperature , both during the  heating '' and  cooling '' processes . for both processes , we evaluate the distribution of eigenvalue level spacings .<n> we find that the level spacing distribution follows closely a poisson statistics , while the tails of the distribution are markedly different , with the latter leading to a faster cooling of the maximally entangled state . <n> entanglement is one of the most important features of quantum many - body systems . in particular<n> , it provides a powerful tool for quantum information processing @xcite , quantum simulation of quantum mechanics @xmath0 , and quantum computation @x<n> . however , entanglement itself is not the only property of quantum systems , as a variety of phenomena , including thermalization and quantum phase transitions , also depend on the underlying microscopic structure of the system . here ,<n> we focus on finite - temperature quantum entanglement , which has been shown to be a useful resource in many areas of science and technology , such as quantum computation and quantum metrology . to study the behavior of entanglement at finite temperatures , one needs to understand how the system evolves during the heating and cooling processes  we show that irreversibility and chaotic behavior in quantum mechanics corresponds to a complex pattern of entanglement that can not be undone by entanglement cooling . this pattern is revealed by wigner - dyson statistics in the entanglement level spacing statistics . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics @xcite .<n> it has been shown to be a resource for many applications , such as quantum computing @xmath0 , quantum teleportation @ xcite , and quantum metrology . in order to realize these applications<n> , it is necessary to understand the nature of entanglement and how it manifests itself in the observables of the system . to this end ,<n> it is crucial to understand how entanglement evolves in the stochastic evolution of a quantum system , which can be modeled as a markovian process . at the heart of this problem<n> is the problem of decoherence , i.e. the inability of the evolution to bring the system back to its initial state . for classical systems , this problem is well understood , while for quantum systems it is still not clear how to formulate a consistent theory . despite significant progress in this direction , we still have a number of open problems , including the  irreversibility and chaotic behavior in quantum mechanics corresponds to a complex pattern of entanglement that can not be undone by entanglement cooling . this pattern is revealed by wigner - dyson statistics in the entanglement level spacing statistics . we speculate that signatures of this behavior may be found in higher moments of the entanglement entropy , since , after all , knowledge of all the rnyi entropy should in principle allow to reconstruct the whole reduced density matrix spectrum . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics .<n> it is traditionally thought of as a property of quantum systems that are inaccessible to classical computers . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the role of entanglement in various areas of science , from quantum optics to quantum information processing @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> there is a lot of interest to understand how quantum systems behave in the presence of noise , decoherence , and dissipation , in order to understand long - lived quantum objects , long lived quantum memories or quantum states that feature many - body localization , as well as long lived entangled states that are long lived because of the non - thermal behavior of the system . for these reasons , it is we present a general method to study quantum evolutions of a large class of quantum systems , without the need for a hamiltonian . using this method ,<n> we show how to characterize non - equilibrium quantum systems that do not thermalize , by their deviations from wigner - dyson statistics in their entanglement level spacing statistics . <n> quantum many - body physics has been a topic of intense research in recent years @xcite .<n> much of this interest is due to the fact that the wigner function @xmath0 , which quantifies the entanglement of a system , is a fundamental object in the study of decoherence and dissipation . in this work<n> , we use the density matrix formalism to study the evolution of non - unitary , generic quantum systems in a very general way , and show that it is possible to characterize , through entanglement , the nonequilibrium quantum states or quantum memories that feature long - lived quantum correlations , as breaking of ergodicity comes from breaking of thermalization . as a result , long lived quantum memories or quantum states that feature many -body localization , should feature deviations from the statistics of wigner s level spacings . to

in the first case , do they all execute the same program ? when is the result to be read off ? the answers to these questions fundamentally affect the capabilities of the resulting system . consider parallelism in an infinite cellular automaton in the plane . 25 , where in each step , any cell s successor state concurrently is determined by its present state as well as those of its eight adjacent ones as follows ( cf . figure 1 ) : * a dead cell with exactly three neighbors alive becomes alive , too ; + otherwise it remains dead . * a living cell with two or three living neighbors alive stays alive . <n> ( 0,1,4 8 living neighbors , that is ) it dies . simulating a single classical system requires only a finite ( or at most countably infinite ) number of dimensions from quantum mechanical hilbert space . in @xcite , chomsky introduced the notion of _ infinite parallelism _ and , in particular , of an automaton capable of solving a problem @xmath0 in finite time .<n> we show that , whereas quantum computing and in particular simulating a single classical requires only a finite ( or at most countably infinite ) number of dimensions from quantum mechanical hilbert space , its _ _ in__finitely many dimensions provide room for an infinite number of s : cf . . strictness of chom sky s hierarchy implies that a single is provably more powerful than a single automaton . in order to focus on the power obtained from infinite parallelism only ( that is , by removing just condition e ) , now consider the finite automata replaced by s. indeed the three citations in section [ secnew ] indicate that ( whereas quantum computer and in particularly simulating a classical requires just a finite , or at least countable infinite , number of dimension from quantum mechanics ) the capabilities of an s exceed those of an automata ( and thus actually lead to hypercomputation ) by how much , however , turns out to depend . we study the problem @xmath0 of enumerating the number of non - negative integer variables of a given size .<n> we show that , in this context , the notion of  infinitely parallel computability ' , as introduced by @xcite , is _ not _ compatible with the _ uniformity _ condition , known in theoretical computer science . on the other hand ,<n> we prove that _ encoding _ of a family of functions solving a given problem , yields _ infinitely turing - infinite _ hypercomputation . <n> [ [ section ] ] this paper is devoted to the study of the problem : given a number , a variable , and an integer , solve the following _ linear _ set problem . to this end , we first recall the definition of _ integer programming _ ( iqp ) , first introduced by symanzik in 1984 ( * ?<n> ?

      "generated": "the winds of o and wr stars collide in binary systems , forming shock waves which heat the shocked gas to @xmath0k . in systems where the orbital period is only a few days , the shocks are collisional , and the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) displays a large aberration and downstream curvature due to the coriolis force .<n> in contrast , in systems with longer orbital periods the shocks may be collisionless , orbital and radiation - field - induced effects on the dynamics and geometry of the wcr are much smaller , but the hot shocked gas may only cool adiabatically as it flows downstream . particle acceleration at the shocks is likely to occur in these wider systems . the collision of the winds from o - stars in binary systems is one of the most important processes in the evolution of massive stars .<n> the winds are driven by the radiation field of the companion star , and they may also be disrupted by the interaction with the dense circumstellar material , the clumps within the stellar winds , or by dynamical instabilities . in this paper , we present three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the wind - wind collision in a binary system with orbital periods of 3 and 10 days , which represent the most realistic simulation to date of this process in short period systems . <n> we find that in the system with an orbital period of 3 days the postshock gas temperature is @xmath0 higher than in a similar system with a 10 day orbital period , leading to a largely adiabatic wcr . for an o - star with a mass - loss rate of 10@xmath1 ,<n> the temperature of the wcr near the radiative limit is only a factor of two higher than that in a system with the same mass loss rate but with a similar orbital period to that of the short period system . at the same time , there is considerable inhibition of the acceleration of the eccentric wr+o binary systems wr 146 and wr 147 display a largely adiabatic circumstellar disk ( wcr ) , which is consistent with the presence of relativistic particles in the dense wr wind .<n> the o star is thought to orbit in this wind , and the radio emission from the wcr is likely to be caused by variable circumstellar extinction . <n> the eccentric ( @xmath0 ) binary wr 140 ( orbital period 7.94 yr ) is a prime example of a system where the relativistic particles responsible for its non - thermal radio emission are located just south of the northern ( o ) star , in a position consistent with a point of ram - pressure balance between the winds @xcite . here ,<n> i present new vlba observations of these two systems , as well as new ukirt shift - and - add ir observations of wr 139 , to highlight the importance of orbit and inclination for the interpretation of wcrs in wr + o binaries . in recent years<n> , there has been increasing interest in the study of eccentric , wr-+o binaries , due to the increasing number of systems in which the we present the results of a deep observation of @xmath0-ray emitting circumstellar envelopes ( cwbs ) .<n> this is the first clear detection of emission from a cwb in the mev regime , and the first detection of non - thermal x - ray emission from any source in the tev regime . with the addition of this observation to previous integral and suzaku observations , we are now able to place strong upper limits on the emission from wrcarinae and its companion , wr140 , as well as wr146 and wr147 . we find that , for wr 140 , the upper limit on the 0.110 mev flux is @xxmath1 photons s@xmath2 , which is the lowest flux limit to date for an extragalactic source at this energy . in the 0.310 gev energy range ,<n> we place a 90% confidence upper limit of 1.35 jy on the flux of wr144 . using the fermi large area telescope ( lat )<n> we find no evidence for emission from other sources in the field of view , but we have discovered a possible association with the cwb , @x we present a new model for the non - thermal radio emission from the cwbs wr140 , wr146 , and wr147 .<n> the model is based on the idea that the observed flux ( @xmath0 ) is the result of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , with the observed opacity of the free - free cwb winds attenuated by the surrounding winds . in this model ,<n> the radio emission is produced by a point - like source located at the stagnation point of the winds , as well as by the dense wr and o - star winds ; the latter being attenuated by free free absorption . <n> we find that the model can reproduce the observed spectral variation of the emission with orbital phase , provided that the absorption by the free free winds of the o - stars is very small ( opacity @xcite ) and the density of the wr winds is very high ( opacity@xmath1 )<n> . however , this can be difficult to achieve in the case of a low - opacity wr wind , such as that from the o star , because the radiative transfer equation requires that the opacity must be much higher than the usual @ we present a new model for the @xmath0-ray emission from the wr - type o - stars .<n> the model is based on the idea of @xcite , where the o - star is embedded in a low - opacity , hot , low - magnetic - field wind ( wcr ) . in the wcr<n> , the photon and magnetic field energy densities are assumed to be of the order of the equipartition values , and the synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) photons are produced in a non - thermal source ( e.g. a disk , a spherical shell , an accretion disc , etc . )<n> . the magnetic field strength , temperature , density , opacity and radiative transfer equation ( rtde ) are calculated self - consistently , taking into account the opacity of the hot wcr and the non - linear , diffusive shock instability ( dsa ) in the dense wr wind , as well as the effects of cooling , synchrotron cooling ( ssc ) and the razin effect . to account for the interferometric observations of spatially - extended synchrotron emission , we review the modelling of the non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission from colliding wind binaries ( cwbs ) , and their implications for our understanding of these systems .<n> we focus on the most recent models of the radio emission , which are based on 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the binary system , combined with a phenomenological model of the electron distribution function . <n> we find that the predicted lorentz factors of the thermal emission are in good agreement with observations , provided the following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the mass ratio between the stars is greater than unity , ( ii ) there is no significant contribution to the total thermal emission from the circumstellar envelope through non -thermal electrons with a power - law distribution with an exponential cut - off at a characteristic energy scale , i.e. that the electrons are distributed according to a power law with a cutoff at an energy scale which is proportional to the local thermal energy density , but which is much larger than the local field energy density ( for a fixed mass ratio ) and ( iii ) a circumstellar magnetic field strength in the wind - wind interaction region ( wcr ) which is in the range of a few @ synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons accelerated by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in the outer layers of colliding stellar wind binaries is investigated .<n> the electrons are assumed to have a power - law distribution of energy , @xmath0 , with an index , the lorentz factor , in the range , which is proportional to the logarithm of the local , thermal energy density , and to the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the local thermal energy . <n> it is found that in wide systems , where the separation of the stars is large enough , a significant fraction of the total synchrotron flux from the outer shells ( wcr ) is due to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission . in systems with sufficiently large separations ,<n> the emission from the entire wcr is found to be dominated by the razin effect ( ze ) , while in systems of sufficiently small separations ( i.e. those with small ratios of magnetic to thermal energy densities ) the synchrotron component is dominated by ic cooling of the electrons . for a wide range of parameters , it is also found that the radiative efficiency recent observations of @xmath0-ray emission from wr147 , a wr+wr binary , and from the tev binary wr20a , in the nearby cluster westerlund 2 , as well as non - thermal radio emission from the shock - compressed region ( wcr ) between the winds of these stars , have motivated theoretical models of particle acceleration in colliding wind binaries ( cwbs ) . here , we review the current status of theoretical models for particle acceleration within the wcr and the ic cooling between the two winds .<n> we also discuss the implications of the models for the detection of non -thermal @xcite @x , x - ray and tevatron emission from these systems . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] the short orbital period of the colliding wind system wr140 means that the optical depth to electron - positron pair creation is high enough to initiate electromagnetic cascades in this system .<n> recent models of the @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission from this system demonstrate that it is possible to use the property of nonisotropic ic emission to constrain the orbital inclination of colliding wind systems . colliding wind systems ( cwbs ) are systems of two or more colliding stellar winds , which are expected to emit copious amounts of @xmath0-rays in the gev and tev energy bands .<n> the orbital inclination of wr140 , for example , constrains the mass - loss rate of the system to be @xxmath1 , implying that the wind - colliding region ( wcr ) is highly turbulent , and that the wcr may be highly clumpy . in order to test this hypothesis ,<n> x - ray observations of cwb s will be made with _<n> swift_. in the x - rays , the angular dependence of the ic emission can be used to place constraints on the inclination , while in the _ gev _ energy band the flux of the emission will be determined by the nature of the absorption process in the radio spectrum , as well as by the acceleration efficiency and spectral index of the non - thermal particles . <n> the next generation of ground - based _ glast _ and _ suzaku _ telescopes will provide a unique opportunity to study in detail the emission from a large number of colliding - wind in recent years there has been a steady improvement in theoretical model predictions of the non - thermal emission from cwbs , in both the radio and @xmath0-ray domains . this work is being driven by corresponding advances on the observational front .<n> future theoretical work should combine the best features of the different modelling efforts to date . in this review , i would like to present a personal perspective on the development of modelling the non - thermal emission from astrophysical sources over the past 15 years , and especially the role of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) . <n> [ 1999/12/01 v1.4c il nuovo cimento ] we report on the first observation of a strongly anisotropic magneto - optical response in a @xmath0sio@xmath1 single crystal .<n> the response is consistent with a superposition of a linearly polarized wave propagating in the plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the sample , and is well described by a magneto -

negligible and leads to a large proliferation of terms in the tensor reduction . <n> we first investigate the production cross section of the process , between typical lep1 and lhc energies , to see how it is affected by the presence of the two gluons in the jet . as a result ,<n> the production rate is always smaller than 0.010 fb , well below detection level . at the nlc<n> , running at around the top - antitop threshold , i.e. with @xxmath1= 130 gev , it is slightly above 0.010fb . for 100 fb@xmath25 per year , a handful of pb - pb events would be produced at such energy , at the we consider the prospects for the observation of higgs bosons produced in association with top quarks at future hadron colliders .<n> in particular we focus on @xmath0 production at high energy , where the loop effects are expected to be the most important . in this case<n> the higgs production cross section can be _ significantly _ smaller than at lower energies , due to a combination of loop effects and off - shell internal propagators for the top quark . <n> we propose to study the production and detection of high mass diphotons , i.e. high energy photons which are not part of the initial state radiation ( isr ) , at future high energy colliders ( e.g. nlc , lep2 , fermilab tevatron , lhc , super -

like disorder parameter @xmath0 , and at each time - step , the particles are allowed to move around the lattice , but not to jump between adjacent sites . in the absence of disorder ,<n> the system undergoes a disorder - induced first - order transition from a disordered , homogeneous phase to a  granular '' phase , in which the particles occupy a distinct fraction of the total volume . for sufficiently large disorder<n> , however , disorder can also lead to a second - order phase transition , characterized by a non - zero probability for the particles to jump from site to site . <n> the interplay between disorder and interactions is at the heart of a wide range of phenomena in condensed - matter physics @xcite , as well as in other areas of modern science , such as soft matter @x<n> . there are , of course , many examples of physical systems in which both effects are important , e.g. we propose a new approach to the study of jamming in jamming experiments .<n> the method is based on the use of the reis -

      "reference": "– Twentieth Century Fox has canned a movie about Patty Hearst's 1974 kidnapping after she accused it of \"romanticizing my rape and torture.\" In a Thursday statement, Hearst said the film based on Jeffrey Toobin's 2016 biography of her, including details of her kidnapping and indoctrination into the anti-government terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army, was \"attempting to rewrite history,\" per the Washington Post. It \"directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,\" added Hearst, granddaughter of the late media mogul William Randolph Hearst. She called Toobin's book \"a one-sided dialogue\" that \"cites one of my kidnappers as its main source\" and \"calls my abduction a 'rollicking adventure,'\" per Deadline. In reality, it's a story of \"a child having been destroyed both inside and out,\" said Hearst. Now 63, she was just 19 when she was kidnapped by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974. She was arrested for bank robbery alongside group members a year and a half later but argued she'd been indoctrinated under threat of violence. She spent 22 months in prison before her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Hearst, who was later pardoned, said Thursday that the Fox project would \"make me a victim again,\" reports People. Later Thursday, Fox said it was canceling the planned film, though it did not give a reason, reports Variety. A six-part CNN documentary on the case produced by Toobin will apparently air as planned on Feb. 11. Toobin will also co-host a weekly companion podcast with CNN's Brian Stelter beginning Jan. 26.",

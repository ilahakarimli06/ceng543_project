dyson statistics of the eigenvalue spectral fluctuations , showing a robust level repulsion . on the other hand , simple , removable entanglement possesses spectral fluctuations that follow , for instance , a poisson statistics , where no levels repulsion is present . we consider evolution of a quantum system subject to a random unitary quantum circuit . we find that evolution obtained by means of universal quantum computation is irreversible and the statistics of the level spacings of reduced density matrix spectrum is wigner -

dyson prediction and is akin to a poisson one . in the last few years<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in the study of dynamics of quantum entanglement , both in theoretical and experimental contexts . for a given initial state , _<n> e.g. _ , in a two - level system ( 2ls ) , it has been shown that : ( i ) entanglement can be used as a resource for quantum information processing ; ( ii ) it is possible to prepare a maximally entangled state in a very short time ; and ( iii ) there is a thermodynamic limit to the amount of entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information and computation .<n> however , it is well - known that decoherence is a major obstacle to the use of entanglement as a resource . here<n> we show that entanglement can be _ heated _ , i.e. , generated through a random quantum circuit , and _ cooled _ by means of a cooling algorithm . in the latter case ,<n> the entropy of the circuit is directly obtained from the rnyi entropies of the initial random state . <n> entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics @xcite . while it has been shown to be a valuable resource in many fields of physics , such as quantum information processing @xmath0 , quantum cryptography , or quantum metrology , its use in quantum computation and communication is still under debate , despite the fact that it is a key resource for many applications in quantum technologies , like quantum key distribution @x<n> . one way to study entanglement is to heating it by applying a random algorithm to it . by heating a system<n> , one can start from a completely factorized state , until reaching maximum entanglement , which , as we shall see  we show that the amount of entanglement that can be carried by a quantum state of a many - body system can be used to determine the set of gates that are required for its factorization .<n> we demonstrate this by simulating the evolution of a @xmath0-qubit system in a random product state , which is known to be completely factorized in the limit of a large number of gates . for a system of this size<n> , we find that the factorization process can be simulated very accurately , and that the number of required gates can be estimated from the entanglement of the state . <n> the ability to carry out quantum information processing with a high degree of precision is a central goal of modern physics . in this context ,<n> the experimental realization of large scale quantum computers has been a matter of intense theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . to achieve this goal , it is important to understand the effect of decoherence on the performance of a quantum computer , _<n> i.e. _ , the way in which a quantum system interacts with its environment . among the mechanisms proposed for this purpose , one of the most promising is the use of entanglement , a measure of how much a quantum we evaluate the distribution of ratios of adjacent level spacings in the entanglement spectrum of a two - level system at finite temperature .<n> we find that the distribution is repulsion - like , with the tails of the distribution decaying as @xmath0 , while the distributions for the energy and gaussian ensembles are close to poisson statistics . <n> pacs number(s ) : 03.65.ud , 03.67.mn , 05.30.fk , 75.10.pq 2 recently , there has been renewed interest in the question of whether the entanglement in a many - body system can be used as a resource for quantum information processing . in particular , it has been suggested that a quantum computer could be used to solve certain computational problems faster than classical computers @xcite . however , the question is complicated by the fact that the state of the system , which is a product of two states , may itself be entangled . to obtain the reduced density matrix spectrum ,<n> the state is heated up , and before we attempt to cool it , we therefore look at its entanglement spectrum . if we observe level repulsion , _ i.e. entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics , from quantum information processing to cosmology . however , achieving a complete disentanglement of a large class of quantum states is a challenging task . here , we report on the experimental realization of a universal set of multi - qubit controlled - not ( cnot ) gates .<n> we show that cnot gates can be used to generate maximally entangled states that are reversibly generated by a disentangling algorithm , even in the presence of strong entropies , such as those due to spontaneous symmetry breaking . <n> entanglement is one of the most important features of quantum mechanics and plays an important role in a wide range of applications @xcite . in particular ,<n> the creation and , to some extent , the characterization of entanglement is of central importance in the field of quantum information and computation , where it is crucial for the success of quantum algorithms @xmath0 . to date , most experimental approaches to the study of entanglement have been based on the preparation and measurement of pure states of quantum systems , followed by the  cooling '' and  heating '' of these states to a thermal state , which is then used to prepare irreversibility and chaotic behavior in quantum mechanics corresponds to a complex pattern of entanglement that can not be undone by entanglement cooling . this pattern is revealed by wigner - dyson statistics in the entanglement level spacing statistics . we speculate that signatures of this behavior may be found in higher moments of the entanglement entropy , since , after all , knowledge of all the rnyi entropy should in principle allow to reconstruct the whole reduced density matrix spectrum . <n> entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics .<n> it is traditionally thought of as a property of quantum systems that are inaccessible to classical computers . in recent years<n> , there has been an increasing interest in the role of entanglement in various areas of science , from quantum optics to quantum information processing @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,<n> there is a lot of interest to understand how quantum systems behave in the presence of noise , decoherence , and dissipation , in order to understand long - lived quantum objects , long lived quantum memories or quantum states that feature many - body localization , as well as long lived entangled states that are long lived because of the non - thermal behavior of the system . for these reasons , it is we study the thermalization and irreversibility of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an external magnetic field in the framework of the nonequilibrium boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( nucleation ) model .<n> we show that the entanglement level spacing between the two becs decays exponentially with the system size , which is in sharp contrast with the ner - dyson statistics , i.e. , the entanglement decays linearly with the size . <n> quantum many - body physics has attracted much attention in recent years , due to its fascinating properties such as non - equilibrium phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking , and non - gaussian statistics @xcite . in particular , it is well - known that a quantum system can thermalize and become irreversibly unstable if it is initially prepared in a nonequilibrium stationary state , such as a superfluid , a mott insulator , or a superconductor . as a result<n> , there has been a great deal of interest in studying nonequilibrium thermalization of quantum systems , especially in the context of nucleating a quantum degenerate atomic system in a magnetic field , in order to",

in the first case , do they all execute the same program ? when is the result to be read off ? the answers to these questions fundamentally affect the capabilities of the resulting system . consider parallelism in an infinite cellular automaton in the plane . 25 , where in each step , any cell s successor state concurrently is determined by its present state as well as those of its eight adjacent ones as follows ( cf . figure 1 ) : * a dead cell with exactly three neighbors alive becomes alive , too ; + otherwise it remains dead . * a living cell with two or three living neighbors alive stays alive . <n> ( 0,1,4 8 living neighbors , that is ) it dies . chomsky s hierarchy implies that finite automata are provably more powerful than infinite automata ; by how much , however , turns out to depend . in analogy to definition [ defproblem ] , the capabilities of an infinite number of automata ( and thus actually lead to hypercomputation )<n> depends on how many dimensions from quantum mechanical hilbert space an automaton provides . fix a problem @xmath0 and consider first the following notion of solving a problem by means of infinite parallelism : _ if , for each s , there is a countably infinite family of s and s terminates within finite time , _ then _ for all s @xcite 1  ( accepts ) iff s@xmath2 , this family _ solves _ the problem  1 '' ( _ eventually terminates _ ) if : 1 . ) every s halt upon input ; 2 . at least one s outputs  0 '' iff<n> s(x ) do .<n> 3 .. ] each individual s stop ; however , the time required to do so may depend on the size of the according family , so that it takes infinitely long for the entire family to terminate . in theoretical computer science known as _ uniformity _ condition ,<n> this insight suggests to finally add the following additional requirement , in order to prove that _ any _ problem becomes trivially solvable by an appropriate family : simply because _ there is in general no means of we show that hilbert s tenth problem as well as the halting problem of software can be solved by turing - parallelism .<n> more precisely , given an infinity of parallel s working on a given input , one can solve , in the sense of definition [ defparallel](i - iv ) : given @xmath0 , the question , whether given @ xmath1 , started on a single given input eventually terminates , asks whether given _ all _ possible inputs are output  1 '' and  0 '' ; otherwise , _ 0 _ . <n> * keywords : * halting problem , infinite turing parallelism , gdel number , hypercomputation , software verification . *<n> ams subject classification ( 2000 ) * : 68r05 , 68r10 , 94a12 . +<n> * running time of an infinite s in parallel : the solution of the halting and tenth problems * + + _ hilbert@alice.it _ + [ cols= \"  \" ,<n> ] the tenth problem * is the following : _ * given an @x we show that turing - parallelism can solve _ any _ semi - decidable problem @xmath0 .<n> more generally , it follows that any can be solved in _ infinite _ parallel families of parallel matrices according to _ defparallel _ input , that is , according to a fixed _ constant _ factor . in particular , any can solve hilbert s tenth problem , which is solvable in parallel by some infinite parallel family of _ infinitely many _ matrices . <n> _ _ parallelism , recursive enumerability , decidability _<n> + _ programming language : _ c , f , c++ , python , mathematica , sql _ in this paper , we study the following question . + given any finite - dimensional c - programming language @xcite , what is the best way to implement it in parallel ?<n> the answer to this question can be summarized as follows : * ?

solar planets , etc ) . as such ,<n> it has long been of interest to study the circumstellar environments of evolved stars we present a new model for the non - thermal radio emission from the cwbs wr140 , wr146 , and wr147 .<n> the model is based on the idea that the observed flux ( @xmath0 ) is the result of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , with the observed opacity of the free - free cwb winds attenuated by the surrounding winds . in this model ,<n> the radio emission is produced by a point - like source located at the stagnation point of the winds , as well as by the dense wr and o - star winds ; the latter being attenuated by free free absorption . <n> we find that the model can reproduce the observed spectral variation of the emission with orbital phase , provided that the absorption by the free free winds of the o - stars is very small ( opacity @xcite ) and the density of the wr winds is very high ( opacity@xmath1 )<n> . however , this can be difficult to achieve in the case of a low - opacity wr wind , such as that from the o star , because the radiative transfer equation requires that the opacity must be much higher than the usual @ we review the progress that has been made in modelling the non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission from cold white dwarfs ( cwbs ) , with a particular emphasis on the role of the inverse compton ( ic ) emission from the hot , low - opacity , circumstellar material ( wcr ) surrounding the stars .<n> we show that the presence of the wcr is a fundamental component of the cwb emission , and that _ simultaneous _ observations at high energies ( e.g. with glast ) will provide a firm test of the models . <n> we also discuss the importance of the razin effect ( raz ) for the interpretation of the observations of spatially - extended synchrotron emission . in recent years<n> , observations at energies below 100 mev have begun to provide firm evidence for the existence of a low - temperature component in the synchrotron spectrum of many agn , as shown by a number of studies . while the bulk of this emission is thought to be due to inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the thermal wcr plasma , there is also evidence for a small fraction ( @ we present new models of the thermal and non - thermal radio emission from colliding wind binaries .<n> the thermal emission is assumed to arise from test particle diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , where the lorentz factor ( @xmath0 ) is proportional to the local magnetic field energy density . the non -thermal emission is treated in a phenomenological way : accelerated electrons are assumed to be present within the wcr , with an energy density proportional to local thermal energy density and proportional to a power - law distribution of the type @xcite . we assume that the electrons are further assumed to have a power law distribution , @x<n> , such that the distribution has a local minimum at some point in the system s history , and then decays exponentially as a function of time . for adiabatic models ,<n> we find that the total synchrotron emission from the entire wcr in these systems scales with the separation of the stars , in agreement with previous models . however , for wide systems , we find a scaling relation different from the previous model , which we attribute to the importance of ic cooling of the electrons . in a model of wr147 , recent observations of @xmath0-ray emission from wr147 , a wr+wr binary , and from the tev binary wr20a , in the nearby cluster westerlund 2 , as well as non -

He took particular issue with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham. \"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer,\" he tweeted, referring to Heather Heyer, the woman killed during the protests. He called that a \"disgusting lie\" and said voters in Graham's home state of South Carolina \"will remember!\" He also accused the media in general of distorting his remarks. \"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he wrote. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!\" In his Tuesday remarks—here is the full transcript—Trump insisted that \"alt-left\" counter-protesters shared in the blame for the weekend's violence, and Graham has been one of many public officials to criticize the president over that. \"Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Graham said in a statement, per CNN. \"I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency.\"",

      "reference": "– Twentieth Century Fox has canned a movie about Patty Hearst's 1974 kidnapping after she accused it of \"romanticizing my rape and torture.\" In a Thursday statement, Hearst said the film based on Jeffrey Toobin's 2016 biography of her, including details of her kidnapping and indoctrination into the anti-government terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army, was \"attempting to rewrite history,\" per the Washington Post. It \"directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,\" added Hearst, granddaughter of the late media mogul William Randolph Hearst. She called Toobin's book \"a one-sided dialogue\" that \"cites one of my kidnappers as its main source\" and \"calls my abduction a 'rollicking adventure,'\" per Deadline. In reality, it's a story of \"a child having been destroyed both inside and out,\" said Hearst. Now 63, she was just 19 when she was kidnapped by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974. She was arrested for bank robbery alongside group members a year and a half later but argued she'd been indoctrinated under threat of violence. She spent 22 months in prison before her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Hearst, who was later pardoned, said Thursday that the Fox project would \"make me a victim again,\" reports People. Later Thursday, Fox said it was canceling the planned film, though it did not give a reason, reports Variety. A six-part CNN documentary on the case produced by Toobin will apparently air as planned on Feb. 11. Toobin will also co-host a weekly companion podcast with CNN's Brian Stelter beginning Jan. 26.",

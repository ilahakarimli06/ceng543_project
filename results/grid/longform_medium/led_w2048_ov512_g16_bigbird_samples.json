      "reference": "– When Barry Gibbs' wife had a heart attack two years ago, the North Carolina man couldn't take her to the hospital in nearby Belhaven—because it had closed. Should he drive her 60 miles east to one town or 70 miles west to another? Neither seemed close enough. But his dilemma isn't unique in a country where 83 rural hospitals have shuttered since 2010 in an ongoing financial crisis, the Guardian reports. The problem: Many rural people have contract jobs without insurance, so hospitals often pay for the neediest, especially in states that rejected the Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare. Now urban hospitals are averaging 6% annual profit and rural hospitals only 2%. And as the former mayor of Belhaven learned, the politics of it can get ugly. Adam O'Neal, who served as mayor for 12 years, staged protest walks when the medical consortium Vidant Health prepared to close the hospital for losing money. \"It’s worse than murder,\" says O’Neal. \"Everybody who needs emergency care and is dying is being murdered by Vidant.\" The consortium did build a $5.9 million multispecialty clinic after closing the hospital, but that left Belmont without all-important emergency care. On the federal level, Sen. Chuck Grassley has introduced a bill to let small, rural hospitals save money by offering only emergency care and transferring other patients, so that's in the pipeline, per UPI. But it's too late for Barry Gibbs, whose wife Portia died on the way to the hospital. He sprinkled her ashes outside his home.",

      "reference": "– Twentieth Century Fox has canned a movie about Patty Hearst's 1974 kidnapping after she accused it of \"romanticizing my rape and torture.\" In a Thursday statement, Hearst said the film based on Jeffrey Toobin's 2016 biography of her, including details of her kidnapping and indoctrination into the anti-government terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army, was \"attempting to rewrite history,\" per the Washington Post. It \"directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,\" added Hearst, granddaughter of the late media mogul William Randolph Hearst. She called Toobin's book \"a one-sided dialogue\" that \"cites one of my kidnappers as its main source\" and \"calls my abduction a 'rollicking adventure,'\" per Deadline. In reality, it's a story of \"a child having been destroyed both inside and out,\" said Hearst. Now 63, she was just 19 when she was kidnapped by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974. She was arrested for bank robbery alongside group members a year and a half later but argued she'd been indoctrinated under threat of violence. She spent 22 months in prison before her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Hearst, who was later pardoned, said Thursday that the Fox project would \"make me a victim again,\" reports People. Later Thursday, Fox said it was canceling the planned film, though it did not give a reason, reports Variety. A six-part CNN documentary on the case produced by Toobin will apparently air as planned on Feb. 11. Toobin will also co-host a weekly companion podcast with CNN's Brian Stelter beginning Jan. 26.",

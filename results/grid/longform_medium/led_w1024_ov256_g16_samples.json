Lebanthe matrix elements used in this study employ the phase space slicing method . Lebana volume of real emissions phase space ( herein referred to as n+1  body  phase space ) is partitioned by means of soft and collinear classes : those containing a jet with sufficient transverse momentum ( @xmath25 ) to be classified as potentially observable ( referred to here as 1  jet ) ; and those without a jet or containing a jet with transverse momentum below the cutoff @xmath26 ( referred to as 0  jet ) . embodimentsthis differs from the definition of n  body  and n+1  body  events where the soft and collinear cutoffs define the partition . embodimentsin the 1  jet  region , the matrix elements are order , but the calculation is leading order . embodimentsthere are no divergences nor are there negative weighted events , so event generation can be accomplished with the usual monte carlo techniques . embodimentsthe algorithm concerns events in the 0  jet  region only and we focus exclusively on events of this type for the remainder of this paper . embodimentsthe phase space slicing method is extended by integrating out the cylinder of jets defined by the @xmath8 using a second stage monte carlo integration . as the @xmath8 is chosen to be the order of 10  gevolts, there is a danger that the integration may affect the kinematics of the event to the point which is observable by the detector . with this in xmath37 , which is a positive number .    the phase space for a monte carlo integration is normally sampled in terms of variables such as the invariant masses , rapidities , and decay angles which give a triangular transformation matrix such that the jacobian is the product of the diagonal entries ( as is the case for the di - boson integration packages ) . embodimentsthe fixed charged lepton vectors in the laboratory frame constraint introduces inherent correlations , and the transformation matrix becomes more complicated : for the @xmath6 1  jet  case it is a @xmath38 matrix with no zero elements . embodimentsfortunately it is simple to calculate this matrix and its jacobian numerically on an event by event basis , which is the strategy we have used . embodimentsthis jacobian is included in the subevent weights @xmath39 and @xmath40 . embodimentsthe total event weight for the configuration defined by eq .

thermal x - ray emission from cwbs with known non - thermal radio emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?▬* ; * ? ? ?▬* ; * ? ? ?▬. however , the lack of success in this undertaking appears to show that the physical conditions necessary to produce _ observable _ emission at radio and hard x - ray energies are mutually incompatible .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there are many possible mechanisms for accelerating particles in cwbs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\most works assume that diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is the dominant process , though reconnection and turbulent processes are other possibilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\each mechanism differs in its efficiency , and in the properties of the non - thermal particles which it produces , such as their spectral index .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\a detailed discussion of the many possibilities can be found in @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\some notes on the key physics of particle acceleration in cwbs were presented by @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\some notes on the key physics of particle acceleration in cwbs were presented by @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\early models of the non - thermal radio emission were very simple , with the observed flux ( @xmath9 ) assumed to the thermal emission from colliding wind binaries on the one hand , the magnetic reconnection within the wcr on the one hand , and magnetic field amplification by non - linear dsa on the other . finally , the _ _ _ _ observed _ rather than _ intrinsic _ values have been used for @xmath16 . suburthis may be of little consequence in the wider systems where the attenuation of non - thermal emission through the circumstellar envelope surrounding the stars may be negligible , but for a given set of parameters , @xmath14 could be underestimated in closer systems . suburwhile there are many problems and uncertainties associated with the early modelling work of the non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission from cwbs , these simple models nevertheless paved the way for the more sophisticated modelling which has since followed , as we now describe in our paper.                a major step along the path towards improved models of the radio emission from colliding wind binaries was taken by @xcite . suburthis work removed the assumptions of a point - like source of non - thermal emission , and a spherically symmetric , single temperature , surrounding envelope . suburinstead , models of the thermal and non - region ( see fig . 神[ fig : iccool ] ) . 神this addition significantly improved the fit between models and observations of wr147 . 神it also modified the scaling relation for the total synchrotron luminosity noted in @xcite - now , the _ intrinsic _ luminosity was observed to decline with stellar separation as ic cooling became increasingly strong . 神in addition , it was noted that the _ thermal _ radio emission from the wcr scales as @xmath32 , in an identical way to the thermal x - ray emission . since this emission is optically thin ( on account of the high temperatures within the wcr ) , it can mimic a synchrotron component . 神therefore , one needs to cautiously interpret data with a spectral index @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( more negative values of @xmath35 , e.g. @xmath36 , clearly indicate a bona - fide synchrotron component ) . 神the dramatic sensitivity gains made by arrays of cerenkov telescopes have led in recent years to a new interest in the level of non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from colliding wind binaries . 神therefore , one needs to cautiously interpret data with a spectral from a realistic description of the density and temperature distribution within the system , and constraints placed on the key parameters ( e.g. mass - loss rates ) by fits made to the x - ray data . practition@xcite showed that other uncertainities , such as the particle acceleration efficiency and the spectral index of their energy distribution ( both of which unfortunately remain ill - constrained from fits to radio data ) , have at least as much influence on the predicted flux as the angle - dependence of the ic emission . practition[ fig : wr140he ] shows a predicted spectral energy distribution for wr140 from one of the models presented in @xcite . practitionlarge differences in the predicted @xmath0-ray emission occur depending on whether the low frequency turndown in the radio spectrum results from free - free absorption through the surrounding stellar winds , or from the razin effect . practitionfurthermore , satisfactory fits to the radio spectrum at orbital phase 0.837 could be achieved in one of two ways : either with a standard @xmath28 index , or with a harder index ( e.g. @xmath38 ) . practitionlarge differences in the predicted @xmath0-ray emission occur depending on whether the low frequency turndown in the radio the non - thermal particle energy spectra and anisotropic ic to the hydrodynamical based models of @xcite . a more distant goal would be to incorporate the effects of particle acceleration on the underlying thermal plasma , since dsa , when present , appears to be very efficient at placing energy into the non - thermal particle distribution .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference , and would like to especially thank dr . josep mart for his tireless organization and enthusiasm which made , i believe , a very successful meeting .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference , and would like to especially thank dr . josep mart for his tireless organization and enthusiasm which made , i believe , a very successful meeting .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference , and would like to thank dr . josep mart for his tireless organization and enthusiasm which made , i believe , a very successful meeting .i would also like to thank collaborators and colleagues for their interesting discussions and input over the years , especially drs . josep mart , josep mart , josep mart , josep mart , josep mart e.  r. , pittard j.  m. , corcoran m.  f. , hamaguchi k. , stevens i.  r. , 2009 , mnras , 394 , 1758 pittard j.  m. , 2007 , apj , 660 , l141 pittard j.  m. , 2009 , mnras , in press pittard j.  m. , dougherty s.  m. , coker r.  f. , oconnor e. , bolingbroke n.  m. , 2007 , apj , 660 , l141 pittard j.  m. , 2009 , mnras , in press pittard j.  m. , dougherty s.  m. , coker r.  f. , corcoran m.  f. , 2005 , in `` x -

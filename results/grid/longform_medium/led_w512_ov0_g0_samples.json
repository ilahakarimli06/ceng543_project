woosley , 1993 ) or supranovae ( vietri & stella , 1998 ) , the immediate progenitor is a massive , rotating star , and thus the explosion should take place in a high density medium , probably a star - forming region . andthe discovery of emission lines in the x - ray spectrum of a grb afterglow represents a major step toward the understanding of the nature of grb progenitors . and very close to the grb region and may be an important clue in favor of collapsar models ( mszros & rees , 1998 ;

the emission is isotropic because the line is sub  relativistic . if each iron atom were to emit a single line photon , then @xmath61 , way too large . and , consequently , the time  of @xmath61 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath61 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 to rush ahead of photons , slow down , and then be hit by the burst flash .the material generating the line must have been released well before the burst .the material generating the line must have been released well before the burst .given their lack of atmospheres and winds , the only mechanism capable of releasing matter from inspiralling neutron stars is tidal interaction .the mass loss estimate for this process by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) has a lower limit of @xmath80 , enough to account ( barely ! ) for eq .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ iron ] , but this optimistically assumes that the typical viscosity damping time - scale equals the light travel time across the star ( bildsten and cutler 1992 ) . though the exact amount of viscosity in a neutron star is not well  known , theoretical arguments fall short of the amount required for the correctness of the estimate by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) , by about a factor @xmath81 ( kochanek 1992 , eq .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\4.7 , bildsten and cutler 1992 , see the discussions after eq . 9 and 16 ) .    in hypernova models , an intense wind should characterize the massive progenitor before the collapse .namecalling @ ri and stella 1998 ) .    on the other hand , the lack of large amounts of material along the line of sight , as testified by the absence of photoelectric soft x - ray absorption on top of the galactic value @xmath11 , for the non   galactic column density , corresponds to a total mass , within @xmath51 light hours , of @xmath96 , which could indicate a large amount of mass only for implausibly large ( @xmath97 ) ionization fractions . ] , and the development of a normal x  ray afterglow , clearly suggest the presence of outlying material located in the progenitor s equatorial plane , at large angles from the line of sight .

      "generated": "- to - leading order in  ( ) corrections in di - boson production are large at the cern lhc and sizeable at the fermilab tevatron ( see for example @xcite ) . embodimentsrun  i physics analyses ( i.e. , @xcite ) at the tevatron have employed constant @xmath1-factors to approximate corrections . with the increased energy and luminosity of run  ii and the new energy regime that will be probed with the cern lhc , simulations incorporating higher order corrections will be of increased importance . embodimentsdifferential cross - section predictions for di - boson production at hadron colliders are normally accomplished with monte carlo integration programs . embodimentsdivergences inherent in the feynman graphs contributing at ( ) are handled with either the phase space slicing method  @xcite or the subtraction method  @xcite with the effect that both positive weighted events and negative weighted ( or probability ) events are generated . embodimentsthe contribution from negative weighted events cancels in an integration over a suitably large volume of hadronic final states , and a physical ( positive probability ) prediction is obtained . embodimentsintegration programs are successful in producing distribution and cross - section predictions the accepted events are distributed according to the description provided by the matrix element , and so all have unit weight . embodimentsin this paper we describe an algorithm which extends the usefulness of the present  hadronic di - boson production programs by providing a means for unweighted event generation thereby presenting the  predictions in a format better suited for experimental simulations . embodimentsit deals specifically with the region of low transverse momentum of the @xmath6 system , where higher order corrections are largest . as for the drell - yan process , resummation of the @xmath7 process is expected to give more reliable predictions in this region  however a resummed treatment of the @xmath7 process does not exist and a comparison with fixed order predictions will always be of interest . embodimentsanother approach for this problematic region is the matching of the zero - order matrix elements using a parton shower model for simulations of the initial - state shower to the first order tree level ( i.e. , ( ) ) matrix elements . embodimentsthis has been accomplished for the single vector boson case  @xcite . embodimentsthe algorithm makes use of the matrix elements from the baur , han , and ohnemus ( bho )  @xcite integration package rather than the individual contributions from the invisible neutrino and unobserved jets , the individual contributions from the invisible neutrino and unobserved jets can be combined into a monte carlo integration over this jet volume . Additionally,an integration volume of real emissions phase space can be generated and so the cancellations between the real emissions and one - loop graphs can be accomplished by a monte carlo integration over this jet volume . Additionally,the charged lepton and missing transverse momentum vectors ( i.e. , the observable quantities ) are kept fixed in the laboratory frame throughout the integration . Additionally,since the jet volume may be large , the fixing of the observable quantities is essential . Additionally,an integration which instead keeps other quantities such as the subprocess energy and boost fixed ( as would be the case if the phase space slicing method were applicable to such large jet volumes ) would also necessarily be an integration over observationally different charged lepton vectors . Additionally,a final state neutrino is not the only means of generating the missing transverse momentum over which a jet volume can be integrated . Converselyanything which contributes to the missing transverse momentum may be used including the primordial @xmath9 distribution of the proton , multiple interactions , minimum bias events , and matrix elements ref . exting@xcite uses the subtraction method , while ref . exting@xcite uses the phase space slicing method . extingthe calculations of ref . exting@xcite were found to be in agreement in ref . extingthe calculations of ref . exting@xcite were found to be in agreement in ref . extingan updated version of the ref . exting@xcite program incorporating an omitted region of phase space has been compared with ref . exting@xcite and found to be in good agreement  ( * ? ? ? )the  cross - section receives contributions from the square of the born level graphs , the interference of the born graphs with the one - loop graphs , and the square of the real emission graphs , @xmath11 soft , collinear , and ultraviolet divergences appear when any of the @xmath12 graphs are treated alone , and so a regularization scheme is necessary to ensure the inherent cancellations . extingthe matrix elements used in this study employ the phase space slicing method . extinga volume of real emissions phase space ( herein referred to as n+1  body  phase space ) is partitioned by means of soft and collinear cutoffs ] where @xmath13 is the jet energy in the to integrate out a large enough @xmath23 volume such that the function given in eq . practition[ expansionparameter ] remains smaller than unity . for @xmath24  tev , the matrix elements are order , but the calculation is leading order . practitionthis gives @xmath23 of order 10  gev , which in turn corresponds nicely to the detector capabilities at the lhc , wherein typically jets above 15  ( 30 )  gev will be reconstructed at low ( high ) luminosity . practitionsmaller jet integration volumes would be necessary at lower machine energies . practitionthe situation is illustrated schematically in fig . practitionthe phase space slicing method is extended by integrating out a large enough volume of jet transverse momenta ( hatched region ) . practitionthe phase space slicing method is extended by integrating out a large enough volume of jet transverse momenta ( hatched region ) . practitiona hypothetical jet transverse momentum distribution is shown for the n  body  and n+1  body  case . practitionthe n+1  body  contribution diverges as the jets become soft or collinear , while the n  body  contribution is a negative divergence at the origin . practitionthe divergences cancel in an integration over a suitably large the observable vectors ( charged leptons for the case of @xmath6 production with leptonic decays ) are kept fixed throughout the integration , and the center of mass frame vectors are allowed to fluctuate . suburwe start by sampling the observable quantities of the event i.e. , fixing the vectors @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the momentum of the charged lepton from the @xmath29 decay , @xmath30 are the momenta of the charged leptons from the @xmath31 decay , and @xmath32 is the missing transverse momentum . with the @xmath31 boson taken on shell and requiring no net momentum transverse to the beam , and the @xmath31 boson taken on shell and requiring no net momentum transverse to the beam , and the @xmath31 boson taken on shell and requiring no net momentum transverse to the beam , and the @xmath31 boson taken on shell and requiring no net momentum transverse to the beam , and the @xmath31 boson taken on shell . suburthis amounts to 8 degrees of freedom .    for the case of the n  body  matrix element these vectors also fix the neutrino four - xmath37 , which is a positive number .    the phase space for a monte carlo integration is normally sampled in terms of variables such as the invariant masses , rapidities , and decay angles which give a triangular transformation matrix such that the jacobian is the product of the diagonal entries ( as is the case for the di - boson integration packages ) .@@@@@@@@the fixed charged lepton vectors in the laboratory frame constraint introduces inherent correlations , and the transformation matrix becomes more complicated : for the @xmath6 1  jet  case it is a @xmath38 matrix with no zero elements .@@@@@@@@fortunately it is simple to calculate this matrix and its jacobian numerically on an event by event basis , which is the strategy we have used .@@@@@@@@this jacobian is included in the subevent weights @xmath39 and @xmath40 .@@@@@@@@the total event weight for the configuration defined by eq .  [ fixedvectors ] is the sum of the n  body  and n+1  bodycontributions , with a factor which accounts for the observable vectors phase space sampling @xmath41    it is unimportant that the number of subevents for the second stage integration be sufficiently large mass constraint . suburthis difference needs to be accounted for in a re - weighting scheme . suburthe results presented in this section use identical parameters as the comparison of integration packages in ref . suburthe results presented in this section use identical parameters as the comparison of integration packages in ref . suburthe jet transverse momentum cutoff @xmath8 was motivated by what the detectors are capable of reconstructing . suburthe jet transverse momentum cutoff @xmath8 was motivated by what the detectors are capable of reconstructing . in that studythe jet transverse momentum cutoff @xmath8 was motivated by what the detectors are capable of reconstructing . in that studywe motivate the @xmath8 by what the detector is incapable of reconstructing : a @xmath8 of 15  gev is defined to partition the 1  jet  and 0  jet  regions ( there is no jet rapidity requirement ) . suburthe cteq4 m  @xcite structure functions are used . suburinput parameters are taken as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45  gev , @xmath46  gev , factorisation scale @xmath47 , and cabibbo angle @xmath48 with no of applicability of the soft gluon and leading pole approximations . embodimentswe emphasize that experiments must take the integration volume into account by ensuring that their analysis is not sensitive to jets within the volume ( as defined by the jet momentum cutoff of this algorithm _ and _ the soft and collinear cutoffs of the phase space slicing method ) . embodimentsthis consideration is true in general for the phase space slicing method .    with these choices of the phase space slicing cutoffs `` remnant negative weight events '' and `` remnant negative weight events''account for approximately 0.1% of the total sample of weighted events and -0.02% of the cross - section . embodimentsmost of these events are the result of the low second stage integration statistics such that re - evaluating these events with a larger number of subevents renders the event weight positive . embodimentsthere is another class of remnant negative events which are not due to statistics . for these events,the charged lepton in the @xmath34-decay is emitted along the line of flight of the @xmath34 in its rest frame . embodimentsthis configuration is disfavored by the spin correlations , wherein the @xmath54-decay ( @xmath55-decay ) with a in table  [ xseccomparison ] we enumerate the leading order and  predictions for 0  jet  @xmath6 production from the bhointegration package together with the result from this algorithm which employs the bho  matrix elements . the  prediction differs considerably from the leading order one and this algorithm is able to reproduce the  bho  predictions well .the accuracy of the prediction from this algorithm suffers slightly with respect to that from the bho  integration package alone in that the correlations between integration variables make it more difficult for the adaptive integration to optimize the phase space sampling .the accuracy of the prediction from this algorithm suffers slightly with respect to that from the bho  integration package alone in that the correlations between integration variables make it more difficult for the adaptive integration to optimize the phase space sampling .it takes considerably more computer time to evaluate the  matrix elements than for the leading - order case .it takes considerably more computer time to evaluate the  matrix elements than for the leading - order case . practitionthis algorithm requires a further factor 200 over the  integration package in evaluating one weighted event because of the 2@xmath57100 subevents in the second stage integration . practitionmonte carlo hit - and - miss is used to and the integration package might arise . extingthe agreement between the bho  integration package and this algorithm in all of these distributions is good .    in order to evaluate the effect of remnant negative weight events , the absolute value of the weights of negative events is plotted in fig .  [ compare_weighted ]  &  [ compare_weighted_ptmiss ] ( shaded regions ) . extingthe remnant negative weight event distribution is several orders of magnitude below the positive event distribution in all cases and is largest in the region where the differential cross - section is also largest , and so the effect of these events is negligible everywhere . extinghistograms of this sort provide the means of evaluating the effect of these remnant negative events . for faster event generation the second stage integration statistics may be decreased , resulting in an increase in the size of this shaded region . extingit is impossible to completely eliminate the shaded region of remnant negative events by increasing the second stage integration statistics indefinitely , due to the lepton correlation effects discussed in the first part of this section . extingit is impossible to completely eliminate the shaded region of remnant negative events by increasing the second stage integration statistics indefinitely , due to the lepton correlation effects discussed in the first part of this section . exting region of events is free of divergences and so unweighted event generation is easily achieved with the usual monte carlo methods . subura small number of remnant negative weighted events are discarded by the algorithm . suburthe effect of these events is negligible and contributes to a biased systematic monte carlo error which may be monitored and evaluated . suburthe agreement between events generated with this algorithm and the bho  integration package is good . suburthe algorithm is generalizable to a broader class of processes . suburhadronic @xmath59 production can be treated in an identical way , while the @xmath60 process with leptonic decays can be handled by treating the neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) as invisible and the anti - neutrino ( neutrino ) as an observable lepton for the purposes of this algorithm . suburother means of generating the jet integration volume besides the invisible neutrino may be used for other processes . suburthe authors would like to thank the atlas collaboration which motivated this project . suburwe are grateful to ulrich baur for providing the matrix elements as well as informative correspondence and discussions . suburwe thank ian hinchliffe and j@xmath61rgen beck hansen for useful comments .  owens , phys .acebook* d40 * , 2844 ( 1989 ) . j.  m.  campbell and r.  m.  campbell and r.  m.  campbell and r.  m.  campbell and r.  m.  ellis , d.  a.  ross and a.  e.  terrano , nucl .invoke* b178 * , 421 ( 1981 ) . y.  l.  dokshitzer , d.  diakonov and s.  i.  troian , phys .acebookrept .   * 58 * , 269 ( 1980 ) . 神g.  miu and t.  sjstrand , phys .acebook* b449 * , 313 ( 1999 ) [ hep - ph/9812455 ] . g.  corcella and m.  h.  seymour , nucl .invoke* b565 * , 227 ( 2000 ) [ hep - ph/9908388 ] . j.  ohnemus , phys .acebookrev .   * d44 * , 3477 ( 1991 ) ; u.  baur , t.  han and han and j.  ohnemus , phys .  rev .  han .  han .  han .  han .  han .  han .   * 72 * , 3941 ( 1994 ) [ hep - ph/9403248 ] .  fb + @lccc + baur / han / ohnemus & @xmath62  fb + baur / han / ohnemus & @xmath63  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath64  fb + this 2 stage algorithm & @xmath",

theorem was aimed in proving this possibility starting from microscopic time - reversal mechanics , but , as he tragically had to realize , there is no way of doing that . in classical physics irreversibility either has to assume some seed of randomness , or it must resort to coarse graining and topological mixing @xcite . of course , in classical physics , coarse graining and the counting of micro states are arbitrary operations , and it was soon recognized that firmer grounds for statistical mechanics must be found in the quantum domain .    at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a second glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even harder . at a first glance , the quantum case looks even with some hamiltonian @xmath0 and then reversing the evolution with a slightly perturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 : @xmath2 . embodimentsa fast decay of @xmath3 is what is called irreversibility  @xcite . embodimentsit is remarkable that quantum irreversibility and non - integrability are not as closely connected as one may think @xcite , which is another sign of the non satisfactory conceptual standing of the whole matter .    in this paper , we take a completely new point of view . embodimentswe take seriously the idea that the defining feature of quantum mechanics is entanglement . embodimentsirreversibility and thermalization must be a consequence of entanglement . embodimentsas we shall see , it is not the amount of entanglement per se that is important . embodimentsthis is too much of a simple and generic notion . embodimentsa specific pattern of entanglement , though , is what is important for irreversibility . embodimentsthis approach offers several advantages . embodimentsfirst of all , it is novel . embodimentsquestions that have been asked for decades and remained somehow unresolved can now be looked from a new point of view . in particular embodimentsas we shall see , it is not the amount of ent then we try to go back to the initial state , that is , we try to undo the entanglement . to this end , we use a metropolis - like algorithm . to this end , we use a metropolis - like algorithm . to this end ,we select a random local unitary ( that is , involving up to two degrees of freedom ) , and check whether this decreases some measure of entanglement . if yes , we keep it , and we draw another random unitary operator . if not , we reject it . after a certain number of local unitaries , we may have two outcomes : ( i ) the state is fully disentangled , or , ( ii ) no matter how long we keep drawing local unitaries , the state remains entangled . in the case ( i ) we have reversed the evolution trying out a small number of unitaries . since disentangling the state is easy , we say that entanglement is not complex . to this end ,we see that irreversibility means the incapability of disentangling the state , unless one tries out all the possible evolutions . in the case ( i ) we have reversed the evolution trying out a small number of unitaries , we say that entanglement is not complex . unitary transformations . suburhowever , the question was raised whether the findings in ref . subur@xcite are just a property of the particular transformations chosen , or if , instead , the notion of irreversibility based on entanglement makes sense for general quantum unitary evolutions . to this end, we consider a quantum system made of @xmath4 qubits , and subject to a random unitary quantum circuit . suburthe local unitaries are one- and two - qubit gates . suburthe set containing the gates * h * ( hadamard ) , * t * ( phase gate ) , and * cnot * ( controlled not ) is a universal set of gates , meaning that every unitary can be decomposed in a circuit made of these . suburif any unitary can be produced , every state in the hilbert space can be reached . suburthe local unitaries are one- and two -

qubit gate is picked , the second qubit is then randomly chosen as well ) .attributethe heating circuit @xmath40 is made of @xmath89 gates . from the graph theoretic point of view , we have a random quantum circuit on a complete graph .attributethe heating simulations are conducted with @xmath90 realizations . for every realization of @xmath40 , we compute @xmath45 where @xmath45 is a subset with @xmath92 qubits , the second qubit is then randomly chosen as well ) .attributethe heating circuit @xmath40 is made of @xmath89 gates . from the graph theoretic point of view system size , our task is thus to disentangle it , _ , reduce the entanglement entropy to zero , and _ (i.e. _ , reduce the entanglement entropy to zero without using knowledge of the random circuit . as alluded to above, the procedure is a metropolis - like algorithm : we apply a gate on the entangled state at random , chosen from the same set of gates from which the random circuit was constructed ; if the entanglement entropy decreases , we keep the gate ; if it increases , we reject the gate .executethe process goes on until the entanglement entropy is zero , or until we give up . in order to reach the completely factorized state , we have to accept the gates that increase the entanglement entropy .executethe process goes on until the entanglement entropy is zero , or until we give up . in order to reach the completely factorized state , we have to accept the gates that increase the entanglement .executewe actually consider the average of particular bipartitions @xmath98 of the system with @xmath99 running from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .executethese bipartitions are constructed by laying down the qubits on a line , and taking the @ algorithm will fail before we attempt it . in that case , we would probably not want to run it on a quantum machine either .the point of the proposed conjecture is that it does not require any computation to be performed on the state ; the state itself is all that is needed to obtain the reduced density matrix spectrum . after heating up the state , and after cooling it , we therefore look at its entanglement spectrum .before we attempt to cool it , we therefore look at its entanglement spectrum . because the heating process is fast and the state itself is all that is needed to obtain the reduced density matrix spectrum , we therefore look at its entanglement spectrum . because the heating process is fast and the state itself is all that is needed to obtain the reduced density matrix spectrum , we can obtain spectra over many realizations of the system .if we observe level repulsion , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , a wigner - dyson level spacing behavior , we predict that the system will not be reversed by the typical evolution of the entanglement entropy as gates are applied , both during the `` heating '' and `` cooling '' processes . suburother plots show the resulting eigenvalue level spacing ratio distribution collected at the end of the heating process . suburto highlight the behavior of the distributions at the tails , we show the data in both linear and logarithm scales . suburto highlight the behavior of the distributions at the tails , we show the data in both linear and logarithm scales . suburthis ensemble of gates is not universal . suburfor all 100 samples tested , the disentangling algorithm was able to brought the state back to a direct product form . suburfor all 100 samples tested , the disentangling algorithm was not only unable to brought the state back to a direct product form . subursee , for example , the run shown in fig . subur[ fig : cnot+h+not](a ) . suburthe spacing ratio distribution follows closely a poisson curve , as shown in figs . subur[ fig : cnot+h+not](b , c ) .      as in the previous case , this set is not universal  @xcite . suburthe cooling algorithm is able to systematically reduce both @xmath66 anglement level spacing statistics . suburwe showed that universal quantum computation always produces complex entanglement . suburwe showed that universal quantum computation always produces complex entanglement . suburuniversal quantum computation means that every state in the hilbert space can be reached , so complexity of entanglement and irreversibility correspond to ergodicity . on the other hand ,the complexity of entanglement and irreversibility correspond to ergodicity . suburnon - universal quantum computation results in a breaking of ergodicity and this is revealed in poisson level spacing statistics , in turn ensuring that entanglement is not complex and easily undone . suburthe results are summarized in the table below . suburuniversal computation is always irreversible :     @xmath123 & & yes + @xmath124 & & yes + @xmath125 & & no +    it is important to emphasize that it is not the amount of entanglement in itself that counts . suburtypically ( that is , it is almost always the case ) quantum evolution brings about the maximum possible entanglement . suburbut just as some knots are easy to undo and some are not , this happens to entanglement as well . suburthe complexity of entanglement is revealed by the ina grant 61033001 , 61361136003 . 61361136003 . . . , 61361136003 . . . . , 61361136003 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",

ray and @xmath0-ray emission , which is in many ways complementary to that of @xcite , was presented by @xcite . practitionthis built on the phenomenological model developed previously by @xcite and @xcite to explore the non - thermal radio emission . practitionalthough the energy spectrum is assumed rather than calculated , and so in this sense is weaker than the model in @xc xcite , or from 2nd order fermi acceleration .   either of these processes may be significant in cwbs , since the clumpy nature of the winds means that the wcr is likely to be highly turbulent , with weak shocks distributed throughout it @xcite .    while @xcite could not determine the nature of the absorption process from the fits to the radio spectrum of wr140 at other phases around its orbit , future @xmath0-ray detections will determine the @xmath0-ray flux and spectral index , and thus will also distinguish the nature of the low -

loop order , it requires special attention in order to resolve problems with its numerical stability . extingexplicit analytic formulae contain determinants in the denominator of the expressions . extingthese determinants can be thought of as arising from the inversion of a set of simultaneous equations , and can be , in general , complicated polynomials of the invariants of the problem . extingfurthermore , these determinants are raised to a power of up to the rank of the tensor ( i.e. in our case , four ) . extingclearly , any analytic expression will be numerically unstable close to the point in phase space where this determinant vanishes . extingthis is the gram determinant stability problem  @xcite .    in most previous calculations involving triangle and box diagrams this was not significant because the gram determinant vanished only at the edge of phase space , where the matrix elements is too powerful to overcome even at quadruple precision . using this tensor for the @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted .ghostthe @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted .ghostthe @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted .ghostthe @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted .ghostinstead one must adopt the second approach and write the matrix elements in a manifestly finite form .ghostthis is not as easy as it sounds .ghostthe one -

[ tab_xsections ] . suburthese are described by the same diagrams as in fig .acebook[ fig_zgg]a , simply supplemented with an additional @xmath consider the interference between the tree - level graphs in fig . exting[ fig_tree ] and those in fig . exting[ fig_loop]b , the latter being nothing more than the former supplemented with the @xmath19 self - energy at one - loop ( and calculated assuming @xmath87 for the renormalisation scale ) .from tab . exting[ fig_tree ]the contributions of these two terms at lep2 is presented in the upper part of tab . exting[ tab_int ] , alongside the leading term given by the square of the tree - level diagrams . for reference, we have set the cm energy equal to 183  gev . extingthe cross sections are calculated for two illustrative values of @xmath72 in the four - jet regime . from tab . exting[ tab_int ] it can be seen that the interference involving the hr amplitudes is positive and very small , but still an order of magnitude larger than the square of the latter ( see tab .  [ tab_xsections ] ) . extingin contrast , the interference involving the self - energy diagrams is negative and sizeable , of the order of @xmath88 of the leading term . from these numbers , we conclude that the hr effects are unobservable [ fig_m4j ] one realises that not only the @xmath80 invariant mass induced by the diagrams of fig .  [ fig_loop]a resonates at @xmath17  gev a detectable higgs would have a mass @xmath96 approximately degenerate with that of the @xmath1 boson . ] but also the @xmath97 ( or , equivalently , @xmath98 ) mass has a ( negative ) jacobian peak around @xmath93 ! in contrast , the @xmath78 distribution ( lower plot ) would have been of little concern in this respect . [ fig_m4j ]the behaviour of the other two four - jet mechanisms discussed is driven by the infrared nature of the qcd interactions ( small invariant masses preferred ) and by the constraints enforced through the jet - finder , with the self - energy contributions being naturally proportional to the tree - level ones . [ fig_m4j ]notice also that at an nlc with @xmath99  gev ( see lower part of tab . exting[ tab_int ] ) hadronic returns do not enter the observable four - jet sample via interference effects . [ fig_m4j ]notice also two distributions in the central frame look rather similar . for the @xmath101 contributions at the nlc ( which we do not reproduce here ) , the @xmath108 spectrum is basically the same as that given in fig . exting[ fig_zgg2 ] , the @xmath109 one is again a breit - wigner centred around @xmath17 ( as in fig . exting[ fig_square ] ) , whereas the @xmath110 one has a jacobian shape extending to values somewhat higher than those in fig . exting[ fig_square ] , having its maximum at about 100  gev . extingwe have studied in this paper the effects of what we have called `` hadronic returns to the @xmath1 '' in high - energy @xmath0 annihilation . these correspond to diagrams in which a primary @xmath19 current originates a quark loop from which two gluons are emitted in association with a @xmath1 boson , the former being energetic enough so that the the latter is near its mass - shell . extingthese are a novel source of two - lepton @xmath111 two - jet and four - jet events which could , _ a priori _ , constitute a when proceeding to experimental studies of high luminosity data samples . embodimentssm would like to thank john hill and the hep group at the cavendish laboratory ( cambridge ) for kindly allowing him to use their computers . embodimentssm and djm are grateful to the centre for particle theory and grey college at durham university for their kind hospitality . embodimentsdiscussions with nigel glover , mike seymour and jay watson are gratefully acknowledged . embodimentsthis work was supported in part by the eu iv framework programme ` training and mobility of researchers ' , network ` quantum chromodynamics and the deep structure of elementary particles ' , contract fmrx - ct98 - 0194 ( dg 12 - miht ) . embodimentsn. nakanishi , _ progr . exting* 19 * ( 1958 ) 159 ; + d.r . extingyennie , s.c . extingfrautschi and h. suura , _ ann . exting* 13 * ( 1961 ) 379 ; + v.n . extingbaier and v.a . extingkhoze , _ sov . extingkhoze , _ sov . exting* 21 * ( 1965 ) 1145 ; + e.a . extingkuraev @xmath0 collisions at 500 gev . suburthe physics potential at 500 gev . suburthe physics potential _  ' , munich , annecy , hamburg , 34 february 1991 , ed . suburp.m.  zerwas , desy 92123a / b , august 1992 , desy 93123c , december 1993 . suburdokshitzer , contribution cited in report of the hard qcd working group , proceedings of the workshop ` _ jet studies at lep and hera _ ' , durham , december 1990 , g17 1991 1537 ; + n. brown and w.j . stirling , _ phys . suburlett . _ * b252 * ( 1990 ) 567 ; _ z. phys . _ * c53 * ( 1992 ) 629 ; + s. catani , yu.l . suburdokshitzer , m. olsson , g. turnock , _ phys . suburlett . _ * b269 * ( 1991 ) 432 .▬e.w.n .  glover and d.j . suburmiller , ; + j.m . suburcampbell , e.w.n .  glover and d.j 100 + @xmath130 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 & @xmath133 + @xmath134 & @xmath135 & @xmath136 & @xmath137 +   + @xmath72 & @xmath128 & @xmath129 & @xmath100 + @xmath130 & @xmath138 & @xmath139 & @xmath140 + @xmath134 & @xmath141 & @xmath142 & @xmath143 +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +    +    +    +",

ÃÂ the prevalence of dr 15 years after disease onset in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients may reach 60%.2 the uk prospective diabetes study ( ukpds ) , a 10-year study of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients , indicates that the presence of even a single aneurysm in these patients is evidence of dr , with the prevalence of clotting , defined as nonproliferative dr . � a more advanced phase is the proliferation of new vessels , defined as proliferative dr ( pdr ) , with impending risk of hemorrhage . � an ominous manifestation is significant macular edema ( clinically significant diabetic macular edema [ csdme ] ) caused by retinal thickening due to leaky blood vessels , which should be distinguished from mild thickness of the retina that does not have the same serious prognosis . � the earliest changes are a loss of retinal neurons ( neurodegeneration ) and disruption of the vascular structure , which is essential to the survival of the retina.7 interruption of the integrity of retinal capillary bed , which allows the exchange of nutrients with the retina , leads to protein leakage and the appearance of exudates , which are among the early signs of dr . � it is highly probable that the hyperglycemia in diabetes leads to an array of metabolic changes , many of which may be directed toward limitation or repair of the damage . � all the above factors and possibly some other unknown factors interact to cause dr , and it is not known yet which factor may be the primary cause . � the most well known structural components of ret � this study mainly reviews prevention in the initial stages of the disease when medical intervention may be effective . � proliferation may be mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , which will be discussed later . � the etiology of dr is complex and predisposing factors are as follows : 1 ) duration of diabetes,12 2 ) poor glucose control,13 3 ) hypertension,14,15 4 ) pregnancy,16,17 5 ) puberty,18 6 ) renal disease19 ( the relation between kidney and retina is so relevant that the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy should always be questioned in the absence of a dr ) , and 7 ) hyper - lipidemia20 ( believed to play a role in this complication , although this hypothesis has not been confirmed).21 these factors will be discussed in detail . � the pathogenesis of dr includes both systemic and local factors , but we still do not know the exact influence of and role played by each in the different stages of the disease . � the duration of diabetes is probably the strongest predictor of dr,6 but is not clinically helpful in most cases of type 2 diabetes because diagnosis is delayed and the time of onset of the disease is unknown . � the wesdr showed that incidence of 54% by 36 months.13 the results of the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications study , a follow - up study to the dcct , are interesting from a theoretical perspective because there was no further attempt to use intensive treatment and the hba1c levels of the two groups were nearly the same . and diamicron mr controlled evaluation ) study in which there were no changes in the rate of severe retinopathy.28 taken together , these observations suggest that the effect of good glycemic control is most evident at disease onset when harmful microvascular complications can set in . any later intervention is likely to have only modest beneficial effect . Â this is confirmed by the ukpds observation that a favorable legacy effect of glucose control was found in newly diagnosed subjects which lasted until follow - up.26 however , the vadt and advance studies in a longstanding diabetic population did not find any significant effect . Â this is confirmed by the ukpds observation that a favorable legacy effect of glucose control was found in newly diagnosed subjects which lasted until follow - up.26 however , the vadt and advance studies in a longstanding diabetic population did not find any significant effect . Â this is confirmed by the fact that the exact mechanisms that cause persistent hyperglycemia to become dr are still partially unknown , however , the polyol pathway has been found to play a prominent role.28 the polyol pathway is dependent on the glucose overload to the noninsulin - dependent cells such as cells of the eye.29 this pathway leads to the intracellular antioxidant therapy , this therapy may be a more  symptomatic  rather than causal treatment for vascular oxidative stress.40 the formation of advanced glycation end products ( ages ) may also have a role .  these compounds result from the nonenzymatic binding of glucose to protein side chains.41 accumulation of these protein side chains in the capillaries of the retina leads to loss of pericytes , causing blood  flow to the capillaries of the retina, causing blood  flow to the capillaries of the retina, causing retinal barrier dysfunction , increasing synthesis of vegf in the retina,42 and increasing monocyte adhesion to the retinal endothelial cells through an increase in the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1.43 aminoguanidine , an inhibitor of age formation , appears to reduce the early histological changes in the retina . , a family of proteins mitogenic for vascular endothelial cells that increase vascular permeability , has been demonstrated in dr.51 the knowledge of the role of these substances led to extensive research on its antagonists . � the systemic administration of these antagonists might cause serious damage by blocking angiogenesis , impairing the response to ischemic events , worsening peripheral ischemia , increasing proteinuria , and impairing wound healing process,52 and hence the use of these agents is restricted to intravitreal administration . � however , a backflow is possible from the vitreal chamber to the systemic circulation.53 it has yet to be proven that these agents for intravitreal administration are preferred over triamcinolone acetonide . � other growth factors of interest are growth hormone ( gh ) and insulin - like growth factor-1 ( igf-1 ) . � hypophysectomy was performed in advanced dr in the past,54 with a good rate of regression . � further evidence for the role of gh or igf - i comes from the observation of the increased rate of appearance and progression of the dr in puberty and pregnancy , which are stages of increased gh secretion.55 the gh antagonist , pegvisomant , has been 3% vs 10.2% ) , but not vision loss ( 16.3% vs 16.7% ) . Â however , the drawbacks of this study were the excess mortality and the absence of positive effects on adverse cardiovascular events in the intensive arm . Â however , although the exact cause of the increased mortality is not known , there is general agreement that the intensive intervention to reduce the blood glucose level should be individually weighed against the risk . Â however , we observed an unexpected improvement in the most initial forms of retinopathy while using a combination of arginine , glutamine , and hydroxy--butyrate coupled with an increased percentage of dietary protein for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers over 14 months . Â however , the treated patients presented a reduction in the number of microaneurysms after 6 months ( 20% ; p = 0.012 ) and 12 months ( 39% ; p = 0.006 ) , and retinal exudates were reduced 38.6% ( p = 0.000 ) at 6 months and 52% at 12 months ( p = 0.003 ) .

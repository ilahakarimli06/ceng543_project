      "reference": "Dolphin-Safe Fishing Act - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to modify the requirements for the importation into the United States of yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific ocean. Makes it unlawful to: (1) intentionally chase and net any dolphin in any tuna fishing operation (currently, intentionally set a purse seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during tuna fishing), subject to exception; or (2) import any fish or fish product in violation of an importation ban under provisions relating to the practices used on the voyage involved (currently, a ban under provisions relating to imports from a country that fails to implement certain tuna-harvesting commitments). Changes the circumstances in which tuna or a tuna product is dolphin safe and the circumstances in which, under the Federal Trade Commission Act, it may be so labeled. Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 to mandate actions to ensure adoption of a bycatch reduction program. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that each nation participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program should contribute an equitable amount to the expenses of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and that the United States is currently paying an inequitable share. Directs the Secretary of State, in determining the U.S. amount, to consider certain factors.",

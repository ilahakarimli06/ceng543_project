      "reference": "– Twentieth Century Fox has canned a movie about Patty Hearst's 1974 kidnapping after she accused it of \"romanticizing my rape and torture.\" In a Thursday statement, Hearst said the film based on Jeffrey Toobin's 2016 biography of her, including details of her kidnapping and indoctrination into the anti-government terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army, was \"attempting to rewrite history,\" per the Washington Post. It \"directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,\" added Hearst, granddaughter of the late media mogul William Randolph Hearst. She called Toobin's book \"a one-sided dialogue\" that \"cites one of my kidnappers as its main source\" and \"calls my abduction a 'rollicking adventure,'\" per Deadline. In reality, it's a story of \"a child having been destroyed both inside and out,\" said Hearst. Now 63, she was just 19 when she was kidnapped by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974. She was arrested for bank robbery alongside group members a year and a half later but argued she'd been indoctrinated under threat of violence. She spent 22 months in prison before her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Hearst, who was later pardoned, said Thursday that the Fox project would \"make me a victim again,\" reports People. Later Thursday, Fox said it was canceling the planned film, though it did not give a reason, reports Variety. A six-part CNN documentary on the case produced by Toobin will apparently air as planned on Feb. 11. Toobin will also co-host a weekly companion podcast with CNN's Brian Stelter beginning Jan. 26.",

The President shall (currently, may) terminate the refugee status of a person not entitled to such status. Refugee status is terminated for an individual who applied for such status because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution in the country from which he or she sought refuge on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, but who has returned to such country absent changed conditions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall, when processing refugee applications from individuals seeking refuge from a &quot;country of particular concern,&quot; grant priority to minority religion applicants whose claims are based on persecution because of their religion. DHS may conduct recurrent background security checks of an admitted refugee until the refugee adjusts to permanent resident status. Waiver authorities are limited with respect to refugee inadmissibility and permanent resident status adjustment. With respect to refugee status adjustment to permanent resident: (1) required U.S. residency is increased to three years; (2) an in-person DHS interview is required; (3) five-year reexaminations are required for a refugee whose status adjustment is refused; and (4) deportability grounds, with an exception for public charge grounds, shall be grounds for refusal of status adjustment. Resettlement of any refugee may not be provided for in any state or locality where the governor, chief executive, or legislature has taken action disapproving such resettlement. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shall complete a refugee processing fraud study. DHS shall: (1) establish a program to detect the use of fraudulent documents in refugee admissions applications, which shall include placement of fraud detection officers at screening locations; and (2) use digital recording technology to record USCIS refugee interviews. A person may not be considered a refugee if such person fled from violence in his or her country of nationality (or of last habitual residence for a person with no nationality) if the violence: (1) was not specifically directed at the person; or (2) was specifically directed at the person but not because of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Prior to U.S. refugee admission, DHS shall ensure that an alien is not a threat to U.S. national security based on a background check that includes a review of the alien's open source Internet interactions, including social media services.",

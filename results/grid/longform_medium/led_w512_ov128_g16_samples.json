flavor locking in the quark phase of strange stars on the radial modes some of the previous studies on radial modes for hybrid stars @xcite used the maxwell construction , where there is a discontinuity in the baryon density . the maxwell construction leads to higher maximum masses then their gibbs counterparts .as demonstrated in @xcite the models with maxwell construction lead to higher maximum masses then their gibbs counterparts . generally , we find a reduction in the frequencies associated with the deconfinement phase transition .    in our analysis of pulsarswe also consider compact stars with net electric charge . we assume that the star is not destroyed by the coulomb force .of course , we assume that the net charge is rather small , so that the star is not destroyed by the coulomb force . as shown in @xcite@xcite@xcite even globally neutral stars can develop strong surface electric fields .physicalfor this purpose we rederive the charge - generalization of the pulsation equation .physicalthis equation has already appeared in different notations in the literature . in the present paper ,we provide a clear derivation and obtain a simpler expression than those given in @xcite@xcite . in the present paper ,we apply the derived oscillation equation and present first numerical results obtained with the correct equation at one boundary . nominein contrast to the maxwell approach , we do not encounter a discontinuity in the density . nominethis is crucial for the applicapility of the perturbative approach , which requires the smallness of all perturbed quantities , including the fluid pressure and density . nominethe gibbs condition is more involved , because there are 2 ( ore even more ) independent chemical potentials , each corresponding to one globally conserved charge . in this case the gibbs condition reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the independent chemical potentials . for the hadronic phase the relativistic mean field model is used , which provides an effective and relativistically invariant description for dense multi -

Conversely, in the case of the grb afterglow , and the observer ( wijers & galama , 1999 ; owens et al . , 1999 ) , there are only two marginal detections of an x - ray emission line in grb afterglows , one in grb 970508 ( chance probability for a statistical fluctuation of 0.7% , piro et al . ,1999 ) and one in grb 970828 ( probability of 1.7% , yoshida et al . , 1999 ) . Converselythe presence of a strong iron line in the x - ray spectrum of a grb afterglow implies a rich environment located very close to the grb region and may be an important clue in favor of collapsar models ( mszros & rees , 1998 ; lazzati , campana , & ghisellini , 1999 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; weth et al . , 2000 ; ray afterglows of these grbs looks especially promising . In this paper ,based on a bepposax pointed observation of grb 000214 , we report on the detection of an iron k@xmath2 line from its x - ray afterglow .grb 000214 was detected both by the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm ) and wide field cameras ( wfc ) on - board bepposax on 2000 feb . the prompt event , i.e. the gamma ray emission detected by grbm , lasted @xmath8  s and had a fluence of @xmath9=@xmath10 erg @xmath11 in the 40700 kev band . the corresponding prompt x - ray emission detected by wfc had a fluence of @xmath9=@xmath12 erg @xmath11 in the 210 kev band . the corresponding prompt x - ray emission detected by wfc had a fluence of @xmath9=@xmath12 erg @xmath11 ( 210 kev ) . in the x - rays a complex multi - peaked structure lasting about 2 min after the burst proper was clearly seen ; a detailed analysis of the early behaviour of grb 000214 will be presented elsewhere was detected in the mecs and lecs field of view at a position of ra = @xmath13 and dec = @xmath14 ( j2000 ) ( uncertainty radius of 50  ) . nominethe source position lies within the wfc error circle ( paolino et al . , 2000 ) and ipn error box ( hurley & feroci , 2000 ) . the 210 kev flux of 1sax j1854.4 - 6627 decreased by a factor of about two , from @xmath15 ( first 11 ks ) to @xmath16 ( last 10 ks ) , during the bepposax observation ( these fluxes were derived by using the best fit model to the spectra , see next section ) . in consideration of its fading behaviour and position within both the wfc and ipn error boxes, we concluded that 1sax j1854.4 - 6627 represents the afterglow of grb  000214 . nominethe mecs lightcurve yields a flux decay ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 ( hereafter all errors are quoted at 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest ) . nominethe mecs lightcurve yields a flux decay with @xmath18 to maximize the signal -

fit value ( @xmath22 @xmath11 ) is compatible with the galactic value @xmath23 @xmath11 ( dickey & lockman , 1990 ) , so we fixed it which is @xmath29e / e=8@xmath30(e/6 kev)@xmath31 fwhm% ) gaussian line to the previous model in order to fit the observed feature .attributewe inferred in this way a line centroid energy of @xmath32 kev and an intensity of @xmath33 photons @xmath11 s@xmath34 , translating into an e.w .attributeof @xmath35  kev .attributethe best fit chisquare value was @xmath36 for 13 d.o.f .attributeapplying an @xmath37test to assess the statistical significance of the gaussian feature we obtained a chance probability of 0.27% ( corresponding to @xmath38 significance level ) .attributethe other spectral parameters were only marginally affected by the inclusion of the gaussian , with a power - law photon index of @xmath39 and a flux of @xmath40 .attributethe lecs normalization relative to the lecs normalization relative to the mecs depends mainly on the source position in the lecs and the different exposure intervals than the mecs ( note that the source was fading ) .attributethe lecs normalization relative to the essentially unchanged a slightly improved statistical significance ( @xmath37test ) was obtained for the fit with the power  law and gaussian line ( chance probability of 0.15% , or @xmath44 ) . suburwe divided the mecs observation in two consecutive intervals ( 20 ks and 30 ks exposure ) . suburmecs spectra were extracted from each interval by the same method as above . as shown in figure 3 , the spectra show evidence for an emission line at an energy between 0.15 and 0.15 kev , within the errors , with the line detected during the entire observation . suburnote also that most of the flux decrease in the second part of the observation seems due to the continuum rather than the line . suburpoor statistics does not allow a more quantitative investigation . suburthe only cosmologically abundant element that can produce lines beyond 4 kev is iron , provided one precludes doppler shifts to shorter wavelengths . suburiron emits a k@xmath2 line photons with an energy between 6.4 ( for the lower ionization stages of iron ) and 6.95 kev ( for hydrogen - like iron ) . suburthe observed feature may be also interpreted as the iron recombination k  edge at 9. .47 .27we will assume @xmath47 for simplicity , but none of the following discussion hinges upon this exact value .27the case of grb 000214 differs from that of grb 970508 in two ways .27the case of grb 000214 differs from that of grb 970508 in two ways .27the first , the iron line is more significant in grb 000214 : we find that the probability of a chance fluctuation is @xmath48 , as compared to @xmath49 .27this difference becomes even more remarkable when one considers that there is no independent determination of the redshift for grb 000214 , while grb 970508 has @xmath50 from optical observations ( metzger et al . , 1997 ) .27thesecond , the afterglow observation of grb 000214 did not allow detection of a possible reburst , contrary to grb 970508 .27the second , grb 000214 was observed just once after the burst proper , beginning @xmath51 h after the main event , and for a total of @xmath52 s. grb 970508 , instead , was observed on four different occasions after the burst , beginning @xmath53 h after the main event , with for @xmath55 , @xmath56 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 , and @xmath57 , we find a total energy release , in the line only , of @xmath58 erg , i.e. @xmath59 photons emitted within the first @xmath60 s after the burst ; the emission is isotropic because the line is sub  relativistic . if each iron atom were to emit a single line photon , then @xmath61 , way too large . and , consequently , the time  of @xmath61 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath61 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 s is set by the geometrical factor , and , consequently , the time  of @xmath62 b in a neutron star - neutron star ( or neutron star - black hole ) binary merger . undenthe problem is not one of total iron content of the model : for realistic parameters , this scenario can easily satisfy the above limit . undenthe problem lies instead in the capacity of the model to deposit this much iron at these large distances , and at newtonian speeds . undenin fact , under our assumption that the line is not blueshifted ( at least , its lorenz factor is @xmath79 ) , the iron can not have been released in the burst event itself : there is not time enough for matter ejected in the explosion to rush ahead of photons , slow down , and then be hit by the burst flash . undenthe material generating the line must have been released well before the burst . undengiven their lack of atmospheres and winds , the only mechanism capable of releasing matter from inspiralling neutron stars is tidal interaction . undena mass loss estimate for this process by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) has a lower limit of @xmath80 , enough to account ( barely ! ) for eq . exting[ iron ] , but this optimistically assumes that the typical viscosity damping time - scale equals the light travel time across the star ( ( lang 1991 , p. 84 ) , we expect from eq . , p. 84 , that for @xmath84  cm2 a minimum mass of @xmath83 the radial mass distribution from a massive stellar wind is @xmath84  cm2 a minimum mass of @xmath84  cm. the most extreme ratios of stellar wind mass loss rate @xmath85 to asymptotic speed @xmath86 occur in luminous blue variables and red supergiant variables ( @xmath87 yr@xmath34 , @xmath88 km s@xmath34 , lamers , 1995 , van loon et al . , 1999 ) . material located in the progenitor s equatorial plane , at large angles from the line of sight of the star. this material may be either left over from the progenitor s formation process ( as in a primordial gas cloud ) or spewed out by the progenitor .key future observations capable of discriminating between these possibilities will be the measurement of the line width , and a search of atomic species produced in the interiors of evolved stars .key future observations capable of discriminating between these possibilities will be the measurement of the line width , and a search of atomic species produced in the interiors of evolved stars .key future observations capable of discriminating between these possibilities will be the spectravelocities of @xmath98 can rule out any primordial cloud and/or hypernovae winds ; the detection of cobalt or nickel may establish the recent origin of the material from a sn explosion .this research is supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) and consiglio nazionale ricerche of italy .beppo -

eclipse brightness level , and will be overestimated during primary eclipse ( when parts of the pulsating star are masked by its companion ) and underestimated during secondary eclipse ( when the light from the pulsating star is no longer diluted by its colleague ) . extingthe pulsations were removed from the light the orbital frequency of the secondary star is equivalent to 8 and 13 times the orbital frequency . embodimentssuch a phenomenon may occur for kic10661783 , and would result in pulsations which do not average down when the light curve is phase - binned . embodimentswe finally arrived at two best - fitting light curve models , corresponding to two different binary configurations . embodimentsthe first is that of a detached binary system ( wd2004 ` mode 0 ' ) , and the other is for the case when the secondary star is filling its roche lobe ( ` mode 5 ' ) . embodimentsthe quality of the fit it essentially the same for both , so they are statistically indistinguishable with the current photometric data . embodimentsthe main difference between the two solutions is in the mass ratio , which is 0.25 for the former and 0.06 for the latter . embodimentsbased on preliminary spectroscopic results we are able to reject the former solution , which means that kic10661783  is a semi - detached eclipsing binary system . embodimentsthe final characteristics of the semi - detached eclipse model are given in table[tab : wdfix ] ( fixed and control parameters ) and table[tab : lcfit ] ( fitted parameters ) . embodimentsthe best fit obtain more realistic error estimates we sequentially sliced up the short - cadence light curve into five different datasets , which were individually phase - binned and fitted with the wd2004 code . suburthe error estimates were then calculated as the standard deviation of the five different values for each fitted parameter . suburwe did not divide the standard deviations by the square root of the number of estimates for each parameter as we are in the regime where systematic errors dominate the fit ( fig.[fig : plotlcphase ] ) , and these are not averaged down by the provision of more data . suburgiven that we were not able to obtain a perfect fit to the data , there is a systematic error on top of the quoted error bars which is difficult to assess before improved light curve models become available . suburwe have presented _ kepler _ photometry of kic10661783 , a semi - detached binary system which shows total eclipses and multi - periodic @xmath0scuti  pulsations . suburthe _ kepler _ short - cadence and long - cadence data were augmented with superwasp observations in order to precisely measure the orbital period of the system . suburthe short - cadence data comprise 38000 datapoints obtained over 27days and with a the amplitude of the variability signal lies between 18 and 31  d@xmath1 , and possesses amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag .

Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin* ; * ? ? ? Palestin. however , the lack of success in this undertaking appears to show that the physical conditions necessary to produce _ observable _ emission at radio and hard x - ray energies are mutually incompatible .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\there are many possible mechanisms for accelerating particles in cwbs .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\most works assume that diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is the dominant process , though reconnection and turbulent processes are other possibilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\each mechanism differs in its efficiency , and in the properties of the non -

thermal radio emission were very simple , with the observed flux ( opacity `` hole '' in the dense wr wind created by the o - star s wind . opacity `` hole '' in the dense wr wind created by the o - star s wind . opacity `` hole '' in the dense wr wind created by the o - star s wind ,however , @xcite pointed out that in the case of wr140 , even the o - star s wind has significant opacity . opacity `` hole '' in the dense wr wind created by the o - star s wind .these works clearly demonstrate the need for more realistic modelling where the presence of the hot , low - opacity , wcr is a fundamental component .   in addition , the interferometric observations of spatially - extended synchrotron emission indicate that the assumption of a point - like non - thermal source needs also to be modified .    in many ways ,other problems with these simple models are that no consideration of cooling ( e.g. inverse compton ) or other mechanisms ( e.g. the razin effect ) are made .    in many ways ,the state of modelling in the @xmath0-ray domain was , until a few years ago , even more rudimentary . with no firm detections at @xmath0- the magnetic reconnection within the wcr on the one hand , and magnetic field amplification by non - linear dsa on the other . finally ,the _ observed_ observed _ rather than _ intrinsic _ values have been used for @xmath16 . practitionthis may be of little consequence in the wider systems where the attenuation of non - thermal emission through the circumstellar envelope surrounding the stars may be negligible , but for a given set of parameters , @xmath14 could be underestimated in closer systems . practitionwhile there are many problems and uncertainties associated with the early modelling work of the non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission from cwbs , these simple models nevertheless paved the way for the more sophisticated modelling which has since followed , as we now describe this work as a major step along the path towards improved models of the radio emission from colliding wind binaries . practitionthis work removed the assumptions of a point -

thermal electrons were assumed to arise from test particle dsa , where @xmath28 for strong shocks of adiabatic index @xmath29 . embodimentsthough this work introduced a number of assumptions and involved some essentially free parameters , it nevertheless provided a great deal of new insight into the phenomenon of radio emission from colliding wind binaries . embodimentsan immediate benefit was the realization of the potential importance of the razin effect in attenuating the low frequency synchrotron emission within the wcr . embodimentsit also established several key scaling relations . embodimentsfor instance , given the assumptions in the model , the total synchrotron emission from the entire wcr in adiabatic systems was found to scale as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the separation of the stars ( for comparison , the x - ray emission in the optically thin , adiabatic limit , scales as @xmath32 ) . embodimentsthis work also highlighted the importance of ic cooling , which was noted to be important even in wide systems . embodimentsindeed , neglect of ic cooling of the non - thermal electrons in this model region ( see fig . exting[ fig : iccool ] ) . extingthis addition significantly improved the fit between models and observations of wr147 . extingthis addition significantly improved the fit between models and observations of wr147 . extingit also modified the scaling relation for the total synchrotron luminosity noted in @xcite - now , the _ intrinsic _ luminosity was observed to decline with stellar separation as ic cooling became increasingly strong . extingin addition , it was noted that the _ thermal _ radio emission from the wcr scales as @xmath32 , in an identical way to the thermal x - ray emission . since this emission is optically thin ( on account of the high temperatures within the wcr ) , it can mimic a synchrotron component . extingtherefore , one needs to cautiously interpret data with a spectral index @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( more negative values of @xmath35 , e.g. @xmath36 , clearly indicate a bona - fide synchrotron component ) . extingthe dramatic sensitivity gains made by arrays of cerenkov telescopes have led in recent years to a new interest in the level of non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from colliding wind from this work , @xcite developed a two - zone model of the non - thermal emission . embodimentsparticles are accelerated in an inner zone where their spatial diffusion exceeds their motion due to advection with the background fluid . embodimentsparticles are accelerated in an outer zone where their spatial diffusion exceeds their motion due to advection with the background fluid . embodimentstheir energy distribution is self - consistently computed by considering all relevant gain and loss mechanisms . embodimentsparticles are assumed to be resident within this region until their timescales for advection and diffusion are comparable , after which they are assumed to move into the advection region where they suffer further losses as they flow downstream . embodiments[ fig :2zone ] shows the assumed geometry and the resultant non - thermal energy spectra of the electrons and nucleons . embodimentsconsideration is also given to the anisotropic nature of the ic process , where the emitted power is dependent on the scattering angle . practition[ fig : reimer_wr140 ] shows the predicted ic emission from wr140 as a function of orbital phase . practition@xcite conclude that while wr140 should be easily detected with glast / fermi , the change in the ic flux with viewing angle due to anisotropic scattering is from a realistic description of the density and temperature distribution within the system , and constraints placed on the key parameters ( e.g. mass - loss rates ) by fits made to the x - ray data . practition@xcite showed that other uncertainities , such as the particle acceleration efficiency and the spectral index of their energy distribution ( both of which unfortunately remain ill - constrained from fits to radio data ) , have at least as much influence on the predicted flux as the angle - dependence of the ic emission . practition[ fig : wr140he ] shows a predicted spectral energy distribution for wr140 from one of the models presented in @xcite . practitionlarge differences in the predicted @xmath0-ray emission occur depending on whether the low frequency turndown in the radio spectrum results from free - free absorption through the surrounding stellar winds , or from the razin effect . embodimentsfurthermore , satisfactory fits to the radio spectrum at orbital phase 0.837 could be achieved in one of two ways : either with a standard @xmath28 index , or with a harder index ( e.g. @xmath38 ) . embodimentsharder indices can result from the shock re - acceleration process , whereby the non - thermal particles pass through a sequence of shocks thermal electrons and the strength of the magnetic field will then both be revealed .   work is also continuing on fits to the radio spectra of wr140 at other phases around its orbit .   preliminary results indicate that there is significant evolution of key parameters in the model ( such as the acceleration efficiency and magnetic field ) .   preliminary results indicate that the non - thermal emission from the short period o+o binary models in @xcite is being investigated .   preliminary results indicate that the non - thermal emission from the short period o+o binary models in @xcite is being investigated .   one area of interest concerns the ease with which non - thermal radio emission can escape these systems , despite the orbital - induced curvature preventing lines - of - sight to the non - thermal emission from existing purely within the low opacity , hot wcr .   in recent years there has been a steady improvement in theoretical model predictions of the non - thermal emission from cwbs , in both the radio and @xmath0-ray domains .   this work is being driven by corresponding advances on the observational front . in the past, cwbs have played a poor second role to sn the non - thermal particle energy spectra and anisotropic ic to the hydrodynamical based models of @xcite . a more distant goal would be to incorporate the effects of particle acceleration on the underlying thermal plasma , since dsa , when present , appears to be very efficient at placing energy into the non - thermal particle distribution .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference , and would like to especially thank dr . josep mart for his tireless organization and enthusiasm which made , i believe , a very successful meeting .i would also like to thank collaborators and colleagues for their interesting discussions and input over the years , especially drs . josep mart , and my phd student ross parkin .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference , and would like to thank the royal society for funding a research fellowship .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference .i gratefully acknowledge the invitation of the soc to present a review at this conference .i gratefully , et al . , 2006 , a&a&a , 371 , 1280 dougherty s.  m. , beasley a.  j. , claussen m.  j. , zauderer m.  j. , zauderer b.  a. , bolingbroke n.  j. , 2005 , apj , 623 , 447 dougherty s.  m. , pittard j.  m. , kasian l. , coker r.  f. , williams p.  m. , lloyd h.  m. , 2003 , a&a , 409 , 217 dougherty s.  m. , williams p.  m. , pollacco d.  l. , 2000 , mnras , 316 , 143 eichler d. , usov v. , 1993 , apj , 402 , 271 gayley k.  g. , owocki s.  p. , cranmer s.  r. , coker r.  m. , coker r.  f. , coker r.  f. , coker r.  f. , coker r.  f. e.  r. , pittard j.  m. , corcoran m.  f. , hamaguchi k. , stevens i.  r. , 2009 , mnras , 394 , 1758 pittard j.  m. , 2007 , apj , 660 , l141 pittard j.  m. , 2009 , mnras , in press pittard j.  m. , dougherty s.  m. , 2006 , mnras , 372 , 801 pittard j.  m. , dougherty s.  m. , coker r.  f. , corcoran m.  f. , oconnor e. , bolingbroke n.  j. , 2006 , mnras , 372 , 801 pittard j.  m. , dougherty s.  m. , coker r.  f. , corcoran m.  f. , 2005 , in `` x -

In 1936 , alan m. turing first introduced what is now called the turing machine ( ) as an idealization ( ` _ _ model _ _ ' ) of a digital computer and revealed it capable of solving a vast variety of practical problems like , for instance , answering whether a given integer is prime . exting[ defproblem ] a computational _ problem _ is a subset @xmath0 . exting+ it is _ decided _ by @xmath1 if , upon input of any @xmath2 ,    * @xmath1 eventually outputs `` 0 '' ( _ rejects _ ) and halts  in case @xmath3 . exting* @xmath1 eventually outputs `` 1 '' ( _ accepts _ ) and halts  in case @xmath4    having thus indicated the fundamental power of this machine , turing then proceeded to exhibit its limitation by formally proving @xcite . practitionfor example , the following celebrated result of matiyasevich has settled hilbert s to the negative by proving it equivalent to @xmath5 :    [ thhilbert ] on the one hand , a given description of a diophantine equation @xmath7 ( like fermat s famous  `` @xmath8 ''   for @xmath9 ) can computably be transformed into a @xmath1 such that it holds : @xmath1 terminates iff @xmath7 admits an integral solution .    on the other hand , a given description of a diophantine equation @xmath7 can computably be converted into the description of a diophantine equation @xmath7 in such a way that , again , @xmath7 halts iff @xmath1 admits an integral solution . in particular since , according to @xcite , the first can not be decided algorithmically , neither can the latter . practitionapart from the , many further sensible notions of computability have been proposed : e.g. , @xmath10-recursion ( which gave the field its name ) , herbrand - gdel - computability ( which led to basically just a  although a very fast one ; recall that we are dealing with problems which can not be solved computationally at all , neither quickly nor slowly . for the very same reason , ( at least ` standard ' ) and ( at least ` ' )quantum computers are still no more powerful than an ordinary ( * ? ? ? ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we emphasize that , due to its informal nature , this hypothesis can not be proven formally . suburinformal arguments in its favor usually point out that computation is a physical process which , by mathematically describing the physical laws it is governed by , can be simulated by a up to arbitrary finite numerical precision ; and infinite accuracy were required only for ` chaotic ' processes which are too sensitive to perturbations than being harnessable for practical computation anyway . suburhowever it has later been pointed out that certain theories of quantum gravitation might actually _ not _ admit a simulation by a @xcite ; furthermore even classical mechanics seems to conceivably provide for processes whose simulation requires infinite precision during _ intermediate _ times only , whereas the resulting behavior is asymptotically stable and thus suited well to realize a non - turing form of physical computation @xcite . moreover the laws of nature we know so far can not be deduced to fundamentally restrict computation @xcite . suburin fact neither church nor turing themselves have put forward a claim as universal as the way ` decide , yet access to whose solution ( in terms of an oracle , that is , by permitting queries to some hypothetical external device answering questions `` @xmath13 '' ) provably still does not enable this _ _super_- to solve the halting problem .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\however , in contrast to @xmath5 , such @xmath14 seem to be artificial .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\see ( * ? ? ?▬* sections  5 to 7 ) for a more detailed account of post s problem .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\to get an idea towards how a _ _hyper__computer might look like , theoreticians have started considering super - s and their respective fundamental computing capabilities .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\this established the flourishing field of research called ` hypercomputation ' @xcite which entire volumes of significant journals have become dedicated to @xcite .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\devising such a formal model ( i.e. , an idealized abstraction ) of a hypercomputer proceeds in many cases less by adding extensions to but rather by removing restrictions from a .

mass peaking associated with @xmath27 for example . in this respect , embodimentsthe hr events could be a sizeable background for processes like @xmath28 and @xmath jet  jet mass distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath36 and also , if kinematics allow , at @xmath17 . subura quantitative comparison with hr events will be presented below . suburif the @xmath1 boson in hr events decays to two jets , there is of course a large background from standard qcd and ew @xmath37 processes @xcite . suburhowever the topology of such events is in general very different from the hr one , as we shall see . suburthe discussion so far has been at the level of coupling constants and general kinematics . that , however , is only part of the story . to quantify the above effects one must calculate the appropriate one - loop feynman diagrams . suburin fact , it is very difficult to make any _ a priori _ statements regarding the loop dynamics . although the expression for the tensor box entering in fig . subur[ fig_zgg]a , with two massive and two massless external legs , has been known for a long time @xcite those results can not be used for the hr cross section calculation here . suburthis is due to the presence of a _ gram determinant _ that causes problems with numerical stability when the matrix elements are the main findings of our studies . extingas mentioned in the introduction , the fourth - rank tensor that enters the amplitude squared for @xmath39 associated with the ( six ) diagrams in fig . exting[ fig_zgg]a requires special attention in order to resolve problems with its numerical stability .    as with all calculations at one - loop order , it requires special attention in order to resolve problems with its numerical stability . extingexplicit analytic formulae contain determinants in the denominator of the expressions . extingthese determinants can be thought of as arising from the inversion of a set of simultaneous equations , and can be , in general , complicated polynomials of the invariants of the problem . extingfurthermore , these determinants are raised to a power of up to the rank of the tensor ( i.e. in our case , four ) . extingclearly , any analytic expression will be numerically unstable close to the point in phase space where this determinant vanishes . extingthis is the gram determinant stability problem  @xcite .    in most previous calculations involving triangle and box diagrams this was not significant because the gram determinant vanished only at the edge of phase space , where the matrix elements ant vanishes . embodimentsit is , in fact , merely an artifact of the way in which the calculation was performed , where the expression is written in a form which makes a _ fake _ divergence apparent . embodimentsthat is , it should be possible to overcome the gram determinant problem by either performing the numerical integration at a sufficiently high accuracy or by analytically cancelling by hand divergent terms in the expression to render the matrix elements manifestly finite . embodimentsthe matrix elements are manifestly finite over all phase space and can be integrated numerically over all phase spaces . embodimentsthe matrix elements are manifestly finite over all phase space and can be integrated numerically over all phase spaces . embodimentsthe gram determinant in the denominator is raised to the fourth power , giving a divergence which is too powerful to overcome even at quadruple precision . using this tensor forthe @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted . embodimentsthe @xmath38 process one would obtain wildly inaccurate results which could not be trusted . embodimentsinstead one must adopt the second approach and write the matrix elements in a manifestly finite form . embodimentsthis is not as easy as it sounds . embodimentsthe one - loop matrix elements are extremely complicated and lengthy , containing log . in some cases we have kept the latter off - shell , also allowing for contemporaneous @xmath42 and @xmath43 production followed by the decays @xmath44 .attributethe @xmath45 and @xmath37 matrix elements ( mes ) obtained this way have been integrated numerically over the appropriate three- and four - body phase spaces .attributebecause of delicate cancellations taking place among the diagrams , it is however important to verify the stability of the results against different mappings of the latter .attributeto do so we have implemented the kinematics of the final states both analytically , using different integration variables ( see , for example , ref .attribute@xcite for some possible choices ) , and numerically using the multi -

zero mass in the loop leads to a large proliferation of terms in the tensor reduction , see ref . exting@xcite . ] . extingwe start our investigation of the hadronic returns to the @xmath1 by studying the production cross section of the process @xmath39 as a function of @xmath55 , between typical lep2 and nlc energies . in order to observe the two gluons as separate jets , one ought to impose some isolation criteria on them . to this end, we simply adopt a jet clustering algorithm @xcite : for example , the durham algorithm @xcite , with resolution @xmath56 . exting( note however that none of the main features of our analysis depends upon either the choice of to be collected to observe just one such event , a figure which is well beyond the current machine potential . at the nlc , running at around the top - antitop threshold , i.e. with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 gev , the production rate is slightly above 0.010 fb . for 100 fb@xmath25 per year , a handful of @xmath39 events would be produced at the end of the collider lifetime at such energy ( say , of about five years ) . at an nlc running at 500  gev , a handful of @xmath39 events would be produced at the end of the collider lifetime at the end of the collider lifetime at such energy ( say , of about five years ) . at an nlc running at 500  gev ,the rates fall back to the values typical of lep2 . practitionhowever , the order of magnitude of yearly luminosity of a linear collider running with @xmath61 is expected to be not much different from the corresponding value at threshold . practitionthus some hr events would eventually show up also at an nlc running at high energy . practitionfigure  [ fig_scan ] also shows the cross section for the @x . to understand this further we show in fig . exting[ fig_mqq ] the cross section for @xmath66 , i.e. for the production of an off - shell photon of virtuality @xmath67 , as a function of the latter . for illustrative purposes , we consider the cross section to be a cm energy of 172  gev . to understand this further we show in fig . exting[ fig_mqq ]the cross section for @xmath66 , i.e. for the production of an off - shell photon of virtuality @xmath67 , as a function of the former . for illustrative purposes , we consider the cm energy of 172  gev . extingnotice how the cross section decreases by almost two orders of magnitude going from @xmath68 to @xmath69 . extingour arguments about the size of the cross section based on counting powers of the coupling did not take this @xmath70 dependence into account , and in fact they turn out to be relevant for the small @xmath70 limit only . extingthe decrease of available phase space as @xmath70 increases is another important factor at this energy . extinghaving understood the origin of the overall size of the production cross section for @x the gluons are approximately back - to - back ( see lower plot of fig . exting[ fig_zgg2 ] ) . exting[ fig_zgg2 ] also shows the invariant mass and angular distributions for the @xmath63 process . extingas anticipated , the former contains a sharp breit - wigner peak at @xmath65 which is responsible for the bulk of the cross section . extingthe same kinematics are also responsible for the jets being produced at a relative angle of about @xmath71 .    in figs . exting[ fig_zgg2 ] the default value of 0.001 was used for the resolution parameter @xmath72 of the durham jet algorithm . extinghowever , given the definition of the separation @xmath73 which has to be compared to @xmath72 , in terms of the energies @xmath74 and @xmath75 and relative angle @xmath76 for each pair of particles @xmath76 for each pair of particles @xmath77 ( here , the @xmath78 pair only ) , the kinematics described above imply that there is in fact very little dependence of @xmath57 on the actual value of @xmath72 . that the most frequent hr signature is four - jet final states . suburthese are described by the same diagrams as in fig . subur[ fig_tree ] . suburthese are described by the same diagrams as in fig . subur[ fig_tree ] . subur[ fig_zgg]a , simply supplemented with an additional @xmath82 decay current . in the four - jet channel , now selected by applying the durham algorithm with cut - off @xmath56 to all _ four _ partons in the final state , one obtains the typical cross sections of tab .  [ tab_xsections ] . subur( note that we have also included the @xmath83 propagator in the @xmath37 hr matrix element . ) as already emphasised , the lep2 four - jet rates are well below detection level . in contrast , the nlc cross sections would still be detectable in the four - jet channel after a few year of running at the level of 100 inverse femtobarns . suburhowever , a more interesting phenomenology could arise from the hadronic returns in the four - jet channel when they manifest themselves in interference processes . suburin fact , the @xmath84 final state can also be produced at tree - level consider the interference between the tree - level graphs in fig . exting[ fig_tree ] and those in fig . exting[ fig_loop]b , the latter being nothing more than the former supplemented with the @xmath19 self - energy at one - loop ( and calculated assuming @xmath87 for the renormalisation scale ) .from tab . exting[ fig_tree ]the contributions of these two terms at lep2 is presented in the upper part of tab . exting[ tab_int ] , alongside the leading term given by the square of the tree - level diagrams . for reference, we have set the cm energy equal to 183  gev . extingthe cross sections are calculated for two illustrative values of @xmath72 in the four - jet regime . from tab . exting[ tab_int ] it can be seen that the interference involving the hr amplitudes is positive and very small , but still an order of magnitude larger than the square of the latter ( see tab .  [ tab_xsections ] ) . extingin contrast , the interference involving the self - energy diagrams is negative and sizeable , of the order of @xmath88 of the leading term . from these numbers , we conclude that the hr effects are unobservable from this view , we can conclude that at lep2 hadronic returns do not constitute a serious background to the important physics measurements performed with the four - jet channel . Notwithstandingfor example , the @xmath92four jet process is used to measure @xmath93 . Notwithstandingthat the @xmath93four - jet events can also be generated by the elusive higgs boson produced in association with a @xmath1 , via @xmath94 ( where the second quark pair is dominantly @xmath95 ) . had the hr interference effects been sizeable , it would have been a potentially serious background . Notwithstandingin fact , by looking at fig . exting[ fig_m4j ] one realises that not only the @xmath80 invariant mass induced by the diagrams of fig .  [ fig_loop]a resonates at @xmath17  gev a detectable higgs would have a mass @xmath96 approximately degenerate with that of the @xmath1 boson . ] but also the @xmath97 ( or , equivalently , @xmath98 ) mass has a ( negative ) jacobian peak around @xmath93 ! in contrast , the @xmath78 distribution ( lower plot ) ( see tab . isEnabled[ tab_xsections ] ) , in contrast to the situation at lep2 . the sign is also reversed   gev and @xmath56 in the durham algorithm .the @xmath100 contributions are positive in the latter case , and negative in the former .the @xmath100 contributions are positive in the latter case , and negative in the former .the @xmath100 contributions are positive in the latter case , and negative in the former .finally , for reference , fig . exting[ fig_square ] shows the same three mass distributions discussed in the previous plots but now for the square of the hr matrix element , i.e. @xmath101 and @xmath56. we again take @xmath102  gev and @xmath56 in the durham algorithm . for comparison ,we also present in fig . extingwe also present in fig . exting[ fig_square ] the invariant mass of the @xmath80 , @xmath103 ( or , equivalently , @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 pairs produced in the final state of the higgs process , when @xmath106 . extingnote the overlap of the degenerate higgs and @x gev . 神we have studied in this paper the effects of what we have called `` hadronic returns to the @xmath1 '' in high - energy @xmath0 annihilation . these correspond to diagrams in which a primary @xmath19 current originates a quark loop from which two gluons are emitted in association with a @xmath1 boson , the former being energetic enough so that the the latter is near its mass - shell . embodimentsthese are a novel source of two - lepton @xmath111 two - jet and four - jet events which could , _ a priori _ , constitute a problematic background for @xmath112 and @xmath113 studies at lep2 and nlc . embodimentsnaive power counting arguments suggest that the rates could indeed be non - negligible . embodimentsas there is no substitute for a realistic analysis , we have performed a full matrix element calculation , which has enabled us to compare the hr cross sections with those of the standard processes . embodimentswe first calculated the hadronic returns as a process on its own , by integrating the amplitude squared of the relevant perturbative graphs , as well as the interference of these with the tree - level diagrams for quark - antiquark - two - gluon when proceeding to experimental studies of high luminosity data samples . embodimentssm would like to thank john hill and the hep group at the cavendish laboratory ( cambridge ) for kindly allowing him to use their computers . embodimentssm and djm are grateful to the centre for particle theory and grey college at durham university for their kind hospitality . embodimentsdiscussions with nigel glover , mike seymour and jay watson are gratefully acknowledged . embodimentsthis work was supported in part by the eu iv framework programme ` training and mobility of researchers ' , network ` quantum chromodynamics and the deep structure of elementary particles ' , contract fmrx - ct98 - 0194 ( dg 12 - miht ) . embodimentsn. nakanishi , _ progr . exting* 19 * ( 1958 ) 159 ; + d.r . extingyennie , s.c . extingfrautschi and h. suura , _ ann . exting* 13 * ( 1961 ) 379 ; + v.n . extingbaier and v.a . extingkhoze , _ sov . extingkhoze , _ sov . exting* 21 * ( 1965 ) 1145 ; + e.a . extingkuraev + r. kleiss , b347 1990 29 ; + s. jadach and b.f.l . suburward , 56 1990 351 ; + o.  nicrosini and l.  trentadue , _ phys . suburward . _ * b196 * ( 1987 ) 551 ; _ z. phys . suburlett . _ * c39 * ( 1988 ) 479 ; + g. montagna , o. nicrosini and f. piccinini , _ phys . suburlett . _ * b406 * ( 1997 ) 243 .escriptionsee , for example , proceedings of the workshop ` _ weap@xmath0 collisions at 500 gev . suburthe physics potential _  ' , munich , annecy , hamburg , 34 february 1991 , ed . suburp.m.  zerwas , desy 92123a / b , august 1992 , desy 93123c , december 1993 . suburdokshitzer , contribution cited in report of the hard qcd working group , proceedings of the workshop ` _ jet studies at lep and hera _ ' , durham , december 1990 , g17 1991 1537 ; + n. brown and w _ phys .acebook_ * b409 * ( 1997 ) 503 ; + z.  bern , l.  dixon , d.a . weapkosower and s.  weinzierl , ; + z.  bern , l.  dixon , d.a . weapkosower , _ nucl . weapkosower , _ nucl . weapkosower , ; + z.  bern , l.  dixon , d.a . weapkosower , _ nucl . weapkosower , ; + z.  bern , l.  dixon , d.a . weapkosower , ; + z.  bern , l.  dixon , _ phys . weaplett . _ * d78 * ( 1997 ) 811 ; d56 1997 4031 ; + a signer , 106 1997 25 ; + z.  nagy and z.  trcsny , _ phys . rev . weap* 79 * ( 1997 ) 3604 ; _ phys .acebook_ * d59 * ( 1999 ) 014020 ; _ phys .acebook_ * d59 * ( 1999 ) 014020 ; _ phys .acebook_ * d57 * ( 1998 ) 5793",

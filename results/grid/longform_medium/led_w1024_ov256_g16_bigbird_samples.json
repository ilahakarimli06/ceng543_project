[<n> fig : pt](1 ) we construct models of rotating hybrid stars , in which deconfined quarks are at the center of the star .<n> the presence of the quarks reduces the oscillation frequencies of the fundamental radial mode . at the onset of the phase transition<n> there is a kink in the frequency curve , which is shifted to lower values . <n> [ [ section ] ] recent observations @xcite , indicate that a large fraction of stars with masses above @xmath0 have a baryon content of more than one baryon per unit mass . in order to explain this observation<n> , it is necessary to assume the existence of exotic matter , such as supermassive black holes , or more generally , massive compact objects with a large mass , rotating about their axis . for a compact object ,<n> the gravitational mass is much larger than the baryon density , and the star can be considered to be a hybrid star , consisting of a black hole and a supermassive quark star ( sqm ) . as a result of the strong coulomb repulsion , the star is said to be _ charged _ : it has a baryonic core , but in this letter , we address the question of the correct expression for the surface tension of a spherically symmetric fluid as obtained by chanmugam , gondek - rosinska , bielich , and negreiros .<n> we show that this expression is in contradiction to the one found in a recent publication , which we believe to be wrong . <n> spherical symmetry is one of the most important properties of a fluid . for a fluid of spherical particles ,<n> spherical harmonics of radius @xmath0 are the only constants in the equation of state ( eos ) @xcite . in the limit of a homogeneous fluid<n> , the eos reduces to the schrdinger equation for the velocity of the fluid , where the velocity is given by the surface integral of the surface multiplied by a spherical harmonic function . as a result , in the thermodynamic limit , a fluid is said to be spherical if the surface is smooth , while it is  flat '' if it has a sharp surface . on the other hand , if the fluid is dense , as it is for a hydrogen atom , then a spherical surface is formed , i.e",

''<n> however , it is known that , contrary to what was originally intended , this machine can not be decided algorithmically . in this paper<n> , we present a proof of turing s limitation by proving that it is possible to decide within finite time whether a certain subset @xmath0 of a given size can be reduced to a given subset , i.e. , whether @math1 can be made to stop . <n> * keywords : * hilbert s tenth problem , turing machines , herbrand gdel recursion , quantum computers , in this paper , we show that the halting problem can be solved by a quantum computer . <n> * keywords : * turing machine , halting problem , quantum computer hypercomputation , that is , the ability of a computer to process data faster than any other , is a subject of active research .<n> it is motivated by post s problem , i.e. , whether there might exist a computing device that solves the halting problem provably in finite time . <n> recently , several new approaches have been suggested for solving either the halting or the tenth problem . they exploit quantum mechanics and thus form a nice counterpart to previous approaches based on general relativity as the other pillar of non - classical physics . recalling that  standard ' quantum computing does not exceed turing s barrier , these approaches must be non - standard in some sense which closer inspection reveals to be infinite parallelism . in this paper<n> , we investigate such enhanced abstract models of computation and their respective computational powers by logicians and theoretical computer scientists . for example , [ 1 ] shows that there exists an entire hierarchy of undecidable problems strictly  easier ' than @xmath0 ; [ 2 ] indicates that a physical system breaking condition [ 3 ] might actually exist ; and [ 4 ] points out that [ 5 ] seems to be artificial . the present work shows how quantum mechanics allows to _ lift _ ord s classification and so to provide a new promising approach to the existence of hypercomputers .<n> the principal computing power of an _ infinite type of quantum parallelism _ is shown to be that of a _ countably infinite number of fock states_. we analyze the capabilities of an _ infinite _ number of parallel machines .<n> in particular , we show that they are provably more powerful than a single one . this paper introduces the notion of _ infinitely parallel computability _ : given a problem @xmath0 , a countably infinite family of s , each of them capable of computing , upon input of any number ,  1 '' , (  0 '' ) , if for each @xcite , and  2 '' if for any  3''-input , eventually terminates , then so does the problem .<n> we show that , in contrast to the well - known notion of infinite turing - parallelism , the above parallelism is provably more powerful than any finite number of automata . as a consequence ,<n> we prove that the halting problem and hilbert s tenth problem are solvable by an infinity of infinitely parallel s but _ not _ by turing parallelism . <n> [ theorem]acknowledgement [ theorem ]algorithm [ theorem][ theorem]axiom [ section ] any semi - decidable problem @xmath0 is solvable in the sense of definition [ defparallel](i - iv ) iff it can be solved by an infinity of s working in parallel .<n> more precisely , infinite turing - parallelism can solve as well hilbert s tenth problem but _ not _ , that is , the halting problem . in this sense , _<n> _ parallelism _ can solve _ any _ semi - decidable problem , not just the tenth , in the same way that _ linear _ speed - up lemma solves it . <n> [ thm]the halting problem is solved in the following sense : given a family of _ parallel _ functions @xcite , given a binary encoding of a pair of functions , and given a fixed number of inputs , ask whether the input of each function eventually terminates ; otherwise , output  1 '' and  0 '' . + in this paper , we consider the problem of hypercomputation , i.e. , how fast can one possibly _ generate _ from a given input , an encoding of recent and independent approaches due to kieu , calude , and pavlov to hypercomputation via quantum mechanics rely on some sort of infinite classical turing - parallelism .<n> we suggest to bring more clarity into this subject by considering algorithmic/ computational issues separately from physical ones . regarding the respective complicated intertwined quantum mechanical constructions , procedures , & analyses , we suggest , in particular , to : * do quantum mechanics allow for infinite classical parallelism ; and , if so , of what kind ? * what kinds of idealized infinite parallelism yield which principal computational power ; that is , does it and by how far exceed the fundamental capabilities of a ? section [ seccomputability ] has pointed out that in fact infinite _ classical _ ( i.e. , turing- ) parallelism is sufficient for solving both the halting problem as well as hilbert s tenth problem . this leaves open whether the infinite dimensions of quantum mechanical hilbert space do indeed allow for this kind of infiniteclassical parallelism , which is likely to raise here even more difficulties than already in the finite - dimensional case of  standard ' quantum computing . for example only recently has it become possible in this paper we address the question :  what is the physical limit of quantum computation ? '' in particular , in the finite - dimensional case of  standard ' quantum computing , what is its  physical limit ' ? and ,  can it be understood in terms of the complexity theory of computation '' ?<n> we show that the answer to the first question is in the negative . <n> turing computability is a fundamental limit of computation @xcite .<n> this is the minimum number of operations , required to carry out a computation , that can be performed on a given physical system . in the case of classical computation<n> , this number is given by @xmath0 , where the  number ' is defined as the probability of finding a solution to a given problem . for quantum computation ( qcc ) ,<n> the number is the number of qubits ( qudits ) required to perform a calculation , and this is known to be the maximum possible value . however in the presence of noise , one can not reach the maximum value of the number , since this value depends on the state of the qudit , as well as we show that the turing machine , i.e. the machine that can compute more than one number at a time , is not computable . <n> [ [ section ] ] in his famous paper , turing @xcite wrote :  it is not possible to decide whether a number is real or imaginary , and it is impossible to decide if it is a number or not . ''<n> his proof , based on recursion theory , has remained one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics , despite the fact that it has been solved many times .<n> turing s problem was inspired by the work of gdel and others on the computability of numbers , which were concerned with the consistency of the axioms of choice and of the generalized continuum - hypothesis . in the 1940 s<n> , gdel raised the question whether general relativity allows an observer to see the past in a finite time . since then , a large number of papers have been written on the subject , including several papers by turing himself , many by matiyasevich , others by geroch , motwani , ullman , kieu , etc  turing s theorem states that for any @xmath0 , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the turing functions of two variables and the functions of the first variable . in this paper<n> we show that this correspondence extends to the case of a non - empty set .<n> in particular , we prove that if the set of turing - functions of a given variable is a subset of the ordinal of that variable , then the corresponding turing function of the second variable has the same form as that of the _ commutator _ of the two _ real _ variables . <n> turing theorem is one of the most important results of the last half - century , and its proof has been the main one in the field of recursion theory since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . for a general set of variables ,<n> there are at least two or more commutation relations , which can be written as follows : [ 1 ] [r ] n(x , y )  sum_n,endaligned ] where n is the number of non - negative integers ,",

ray energies are mutually incompatible . in just the last few months<n> , definitive evidence for non - thermally emitting particles in wr147 has finally been presented in recent years , with an especially exciting period in only the last couple of months . here , i present new , high spatial resolution , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of the system , showing that , despite the wide range in separation between the stars , there is still a clear , coherent pattern in the structure of the wcr . <n> [ 1996/06/01 ] 2@xmath1 2c ii 4c iv 2fe ii 3fe iii we review the current status of the modelling of the non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission from cataclysmic variables ( cwbs ) , with particular emphasis on the role of the low - opacity , hot , low - density circumstellar wind ( wcr ) in the acceleration of the acceleration particles .<n> we show that the presence of the wcr is crucial in determining the observed properties of the emission , in particular , the spectral index of the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) emission . for a given set of physical parameters ( e.g. the mass of the central star , and the distance between the star and the observer )<n> , we find that the observed spectral index is very sensitive to the value of the stellar mass , while the value is much less so for the distance . as a result ,<n> the observed values of the spectral indices are very sensitive not only to the effective temperature of the emitting electrons , but also to the electron density and to the magnetic field strength in the w cr . <n> we also discuss the role played by the o - star s wind in the radiative transfer process . in this case  we review the models of the thermal and non - thermal radio emission from colliding wind binaries ( cwbs ) , and their predictions for the @xmath0-ray emission from these systems .<n> we describe the basic assumptions of the models , as well as some of the problems and uncertainties that have arisen since these models were first presented in the early 1990 s . <n> we then discuss the latest developments in our understanding of the @ x - ray emission from cwb systems , with particular emphasis on the _ direct _ detection of the x - rays from the colliding wind binary , sgr a * , using _<n> chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.<n> this source was recently found to exhibit a large , single - peaked , double - lobed x -ray profile , suggesting that it is a cwb , rather than a supernova remnant , in which case we would expect to see a much larger x - - ray luminosity from this source . finally , we discuss the prospects for future detections of the synchrotron emission from the wcr , which is thought to be responsible for a large fraction of the total synchrotron luminosity in these systems we review the models of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from colliding wind binaries , and their implications for the interpretation of observations .<n> in particular , we focus on the ic emission from wr140 , which is expected to be detectable with glast / fermi , as well as on wr20a , a wr+wr binary , for which no firm conclusions can be drawn at present from the available data . <n> [ firstpage ] x -

It \"directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,\" added Hearst, granddaughter of the late media mogul William Randolph Hearst. She called Toobin's book \"a one-sided dialogue\" that \"cites one of my kidnappers as its main source\" and \"calls my abduction a 'rollicking adventure,'\" per Deadline. In reality, it's a story of \"a child having been destroyed both inside and out,\" said Hearst. Now 63, she was just 19 when she was kidnapped by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974. She was arrested for bank robbery alongside group members a year and a half later but argued she'd been indoctrinated under threat of violence. She spent 22 months in prison before her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Hearst, who was later pardoned, said Thursday that the Fox project would \"make me a victim again,\" reports People. Later Thursday, Fox said it was canceling the planned film, though it did not give a reason, reports Variety. A six-part CNN documentary on the case produced by Toobin will apparently air as planned on Feb. 11. Toobin will also co-host a weekly companion podcast with CNN's Brian Stelter beginning Jan. 26.",

      "reference": "Social Security Number Protection Act of 2006 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make it unlawful for any person to sell or purchase a Social Security number in a manner that violates a regulation promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Directs the FTC to promulgate regulations restricting the sale and purchase of such numbers and any unfair or deceptive acts or practices involved in such a sale or purchase. Requires such regulations to be no broader than necessary to: (1) provide reasonable assurance that Social Security numbers will not be used to commit or facilitate fraud, deception, or crime; and (2) prevent an undue risk of bodily, emotional, or financial harm to individuals. Requires such regulations also to include exceptions which permit the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers to the extent necessary for: (1) law enforcement, national security, and public health purposes; (2) research conducted for the purpose of advancing public knowledge, subject to certain conditions; and (3) legitimate consumer credit verification, if the numbers used are redacted in accordance with uniform redaction standards established by the FTC in such regulations. Requires exceptions also for the sale and purchase of such numbers to the extent: (1) necessary in emergency situations to protect the health or safety of one or more individuals; and (2) consistent with an individual's voluntary and affirmative written consent to the sale or purchase of his or her number. Prescribes enforcement requirements. Authorizes states to bring civil actions on behalf of state residents in a U.S. district court to: (1) enjoin an act or practice; (2) enforce compliance with the regulation; (3) obtain civil penalties in an amount of $11,000 per violation, up to a total of $5 million; or (4) obtain other appropriate legal and equitable relief. Allows the U.S. Attorney General to institute a criminal proceeding for a violation of this Act.",
      "generated": "we address the following question : is there a restriction on the numbers that can be used in a financial transaction ?<n> specifically , we show that the number may not be used as a proxy for the identity of an individual , or for the number of an application , nor does it suffice to consider the number to be the same for each application . <n> our main result is that : a ) there is no _ a priori _ restriction on numbers .<n> b ) the numbers may be used for an application only if they are the same as the numbers used in the application ; and c ) for an individual to have a number , they must have a valid financial account . '' [ [ section ] ] in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the number - theoretic issues . in particular ,<n> the number theory has been the object of considerable recent attention , partly because of its connection to financial markets , and partly due to its relation to the so - called  _ secret number problem _ '' , i.e. , the problem of identifying numbers in financial transactions . from a practical point we show that the natural laws of thermodynamics limit the number of degrees of freedom of a system to those of a single species .<n> this is a consequence of the fact that a system is thermodynamically stable if and only if its degree of freedom is a single variable . <n> we consider the thermodynamics of systems composed of a finite number of particles . in the first part of the paper , we consider a system composed of two species , one of which is a molecule and the other is an atom . for the case of a molecule ,<n> we prove that the number , @xmath0 , of molecules in the system is bounded from above by the number in the atom - molecule potential . to obtain this bound<n> , the system must satisfy the following two conditions : ( i ) the molecule must be in a state of thermodynamical equilibrium , and ( ii ) it must have a non - zero probability of being trapped in a potential well . this is a version of the following question : under what conditions are there restrictions on the ability of a governmental body to act in the best interest of the society it purports to represent ?<n> this question is answered in the affirmative for the following cases : 1 . <n> a government body has the right to impose restrictions on its ability to serve the community in a manner that is consistent with its mission , subject to the following conditions : ( 1 ) any member of the government body can arbitrarily arbitrarily arbitrarily impose restrictions ; ( 2 ) there is no conflict of interest between the mission and the operations of the body ; and ( 3 ) no conflict is caused by the fact that the body has a nonuniform distribution of powers among its members .",
